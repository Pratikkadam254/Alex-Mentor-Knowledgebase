Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
Welcome everyone to episode 2 of Jim Secrets podcast, my name is Alex from Rosie and I will be your host on this Magic Carpet Ride.
Hope you guys have an awesome morning or whatever.
Time of day that you guys are listening in.
One of the concepts that I want to talk about today is probably the first thing that I bring up with every single gym owner that I get on the phone with it.
0:39
I usually talk to two to three new, Jim's a day, and it's going to be Central to everything that I talked about with regards to Jim.
So, I figured it would be Salient to bring it up in the first podcast and it's and it's just basic concept between.
0:54
How do you attract customers and what is your initial offer going to be on one?
And I would say, most gyms Cruise, whatever it is, would espouse doing a low barrier to entry offer.
An lbo is probably how I refer to it going forward.
1:12
And here's here's going to be a numerical demonstration of why I don't think that's why that makes any sense and then I'll maybe talk I'll touch a little bit on the psychological reason why I don't think makes sense.
But the biggest one is just gonna be the dollars and cents reason.
So no matter what you're doing or where you're advertising and if you're not Advertising them or do we need to talk but but no matter where you're running, your ads are getting your traffic from other that's YouTube as Instagram and Facebook ads, you run a newspaper has Direct Mail.
1:42
Whatever it is, right?
You're going to be paying a certain amount for a certain amount of attention, right?
And then you're from that, you'll be able to convert a certain amount of tension and inquiries and from those increases certain amount of those into sales, right?
So it's going to come, the cost of acquisition is going to be really important to understand and then how it relates to cash flow.
1:59
So I'll On this.
If you were to think about this mentally as two different sides of piece of paper, on the left side, you have an lbo and on the right side you have what I would consider a medium ticket offer which would be like a 500. 600 dollar offer, which I think works best for the introductory offer for a low ticket pricing recurring.
2:19
So if your recurring is like around the, you know, 100 to $200 a month range and then I would consider that a low ticket recurring, which is usually a large group your boot camps across fits any You know circuit style, whatever you want to call it training facilities.
Now here's what how this works from the numbers standpoint?
2:38
So let's say an lbo you spend $1000 on advertisements wherever you get them from, let's say from that thousand dollars you get 100 leads okay 100 leads cost you about 10 bucks a weed and then from this hundred leads, let's say you convert 30 percent of those people, over the phone into you know a $21 21-day So you convert 30 people at $21 you make six hundred and thirty dollars on the front end from your thousand dollars spent.
3:07
Now there's a couple important numbers from here.
So from 100 leads you to 6 and 30 August me G of six dollars and thirty cents per lead in Revenue, all right which will be an important number.
I'll get back to you.
So six dollars and thirty cents per lie.
The other important thing to note here is that time duration.
3:25
So usually this will take, let's say, two weeks to start.
Art from the whole campaign and then maybe 21 days.
Obviously to fulfill on that, 21 do promotion and then once the 21-day promotions over maybe a week to convert everyone, right over into f t.
3:40
So the whole thing will take six weeks.
Here's why?
I don't think that works well.
So I used to work with like the the concept is okay.
Well I lost a little on the front end.
It's been a thousand made 600, so I lost 400 bucks.
Not too big of a deal because I'm going to get of these 30 people.
3:56
I'm going to get half of them to say like that's the thought but Um, Howard son reality.
And the reason that we think about that is because like most of us grew up with LA Fitness and 24 Hour Fitness and all the Big Jim's and that's how they did it, right?
They ran lbos free month's free.
Whatevers to get people in the door and then keep them on $29 a month memberships, right?
4:14
So, I've worked with some of these Big Jim's and I know what their numbers are.
So usually they spend about $150 to acquire crush with a pace $29 a month for 36 months because usually their lifetime value.
So you're like they're happy to do that.
Now, the caveat is it takes them.
The five months to recoup that initial hundred and fifty dollars that they spent in the acquisition process and I don't know about you, but most small business owners, especially small gym owners don't have the cash flow to float, but the cash reserves to float, five months of acquisition cost for a new customer.
4:45
So, if you had to spend money on marketing for five straight months and not make any money and then finally, turn your first dollar of profit.
Most people couldn't do that, which is why running our gyms in our promotions that way, it doesn't make sense because I'll go back to the example and show how this gets Limited.
So, you have like that whole process, right?
5:02
You two weeks, our sales, three weeks of fulfillment, and then maybe a week, conversions was maybe six weeks.
So the average gym, let's say has 100 clients.
All right, on EFT that I talked to not people, not like successful Jim's.
I'm just saying the average gym, right?
And 100 James is 100.
People is just enough to pretty much break even and live out of the business account and spend less than $500 a week and try not to spend any money, that sounds familiar to anyone.
5:27
We should talk anyways, Shameless plug.
Anyways, so from that, from that hundred people, most people have about a 10 percent attrition rate.
Like I said, average average injury, 10% Rishon, so they lose 10 people a month, they science and people a month, and that's where they stay.
5:45
And they stay in that Rodeo for years sometimes because they can't sign up more than they're losing, right?
So, if that lbo offer, let's say they sign up, 30 people over the phone.
That means, 25 people actually show up because it's so cheap and they don't care about it.
Anyways, from the 25 people that show up.
Salute you'll keep let's say half if you're if you're if we're being really optimistic, right?
6:07
Because the jump from 21 to, you know, $200 a month is fairly significant.
Whatever right.
So 12 people end up staying over that six week period, right?
Because that's that's the end result of that whole campaign.
Now mind you in that suit because this whole campaign didn't happen in a vacuum you are not just net 12 positive, you had time that elapsed and you had to make up for attrition like patricians like the Ation for the dollar, but for a gym, right?
6:31
It's like you might have made some money, but at the same time, your money got to Value.
So you might have signed up some clients but you're Jim lost members so over that whole six, six week period, you would have lost, you know, 15 members from attrition and then you gained 12 clients off this marketing campaign.
6:48
And so over that whole period of time your neck - and you lost $400 in the front end and guys will continue to get on this train and ride it over and over and over again.
And usually they start, they end up back where they started.
It and they don't know why, they don't know why, they're Jim will grow, right?
If this sounds familiar to anyone, good?
7:06
Because there's other ways to do it.
Okay, so keep that in your mind.
That's that's the old way of doing things, okay?
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
7:25
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
The new way of doing things is by offering medium and I take it offers as front and offers.
7:42
Now here's why this makes sense, okay?
I'll just give the numbers behind a medium ticket offer.
Let's say, you sign people up on a 600 dollar, you know, six-week offer to start off with and most people were, like, I could never charge that much.
I promise you, we've done it in a hundred and some markets.
7:58
You can we sold it in the hood of DC you can I promise?
All right, but just walk with me in this very land for a moment.
So let's say you spend the same thousand bucks, you get the same hundred leads, okay, realistically?
You probably be cheaper leads because the offers better but I will get into that.
8:14
So let's say you spend $1000. 100 leads a hundred leads equals twenty percent of those people into a six hundred dollar offer, okay?
So that's twelve thousand dollars right there from there.
You upsell them, another $150 I had in supplements with a 50% margin so you making $75, add on top that you're making 675 per person who signed up okay, times 20.
8:36
All right, so you're looking at thirteen thousand five hundred dollars off of that initial thousand dollars that's been.
All right.
Now obviously getting 13 and a half to 1, which is great.
Eight, but here's where it gets even cooler.
If you compare the two Revenue per lead, okay, the first example we had was six dollars and thirty cents per liter.
8:54
This example is $135 per lead, so if you to back up and look at it, you're like okay this guy makes $135 lead.
This guy makes 630 sets.
Okay, so I have all these different Avenues of buying traffic who's going to be able to reliably by more leads.
9:14
The guy on the right, the guy who had $135 per lead, who's gonna be able to buy more expensive leads him whose to be able to buy more quantity of leads him.
If it's an auction-based thing who's gonna be able to price to out of the marketplace, he's gonna be able to price the other guy, the marketplace.
He's get he's getting 21 times, the revenue on the front end as the guy on the left.
9:34
Okay, now here's where it gets, I think even cooler.
So the reason that we've been able to fill up gyms in 30 days, I was like my claim to fame and I always open my chips at full capacity except for my first one which I learned my lesson from and then everyone after that we opened at full capacity so it works like this, okay?
9:56
If every time.
So from a day-to-day standpoint, let the guy in the, on the left.
He lost money in the front, which means he had to take money out of his pocket.
Spend it hoping to acquire customers and then recover that money on the back end overtime, right?
With an increased EFT, that's the hope.
10:11
The reality isn't that?
Which is hopefully what I explained.
Okay.
Now the, the opposite of that, and that's why I might add you.
As a side note wife, people in the fitness space used to wear like, a lot of gym owners like this book used to work doesn't work anymore.
They change their Our algorithms like they didn't change algorithms better competitors in the marketplace and like you just no longer were strong competitor because stronger guys came in and they were able to outbid you for the same amount of attention, the same amount of Impressions.
10:38
And so when you're making six dollars and thirty cents per lead, you can't go very far when you make it $135 lead.
If they 5x their prices we're still making 421 and we can still play here you can't because you're doing six dollars and thirty cents.
Hopefully this is resonating with someone who's listening but Here's how it works with day-to-day standpoint.
10:58
I think this is probably the most powerful piece of why the new way is the new way.
And it's better way it works like this.
So, let's say you spend $50 on day one. $50, typically, speaking, as an aggregate of all the campaigns that we've been running, usually will get you out 15 leads.
11:15
Okay, so you get 15 leads for 50 bucks and your clothes and 20 percent, which means you close three sales 600.
So you make 1,800 bucks a day to you close three sales.
At 600, you spend the same 50 bucks.
You make 1800 day three.
Same thing, spend 50 make 1,800.
11:31
Now here's the cool thing on day four, if you have any kind of processor, my body's in planar water fight, whatever it is, write that first sales day.
Alright of eighteen hundred dollars will hit your account, okay?
And so, at that point, let's say you started with your account with $500.
11:50
So it debited 50, 50 and 50.
All right.
So, you were down to 350 for this marketing campaign, but on days, For eighteen hundred dollars, it's that account.
So now you're at 2150 and then on Friday, another eighteen hundred dollars hits.
And so you're at 3950, okay?
12:08
And you're still spending $50 a day.
So, what happened here?
Your initial budget grew, because of the positive cash flow in the acquisition process.
Now, this is why this is super important.
A lot of people always ask me well, how much, how much should I budget for marketing?
And like, we don't budget for marketing?
12:25
We make money when we mark it which is why we can continually I called customer financed acquisition, but customers were financing the acquisition of more customers.
So all we really need to do to start a gym, was put five thousand dollars, aside sign the lease and then within 30 days, we bought the flooring painted the walls bought the equipment, put the front desk, and put the sign out front, did all that stuff while selling and opening the gym with 200 people.
12:53
So when you sign up to two people at $600, you make And twenty thousand dollars when you open your gym, starting with an empty bank account.
So, like, how cool would it be to be paid to open your gyms?
Like, there's a reason we were able to open six in such a short amount of time, off cash flow.
Like this is why, this is how we did it, right?
13:10
And if you follow the same logic, if it doesn't cost you money to acquire customers and you make money in the acquisition process, then you would logically always be in the acquisition process because you can do so profitably.
And as long as you can do so profitably than your gym, will always be a full The which then raises the next question.
13:28
Once my dreams at full capacity then what do I do?
Which I will address in the next gym Secrets podcast.
So anyways, hope this was useful for you guys.
It's a really Central concept to how I talk about Jim's and how we talk about acquiring customers and how to make a talk about filling gyms, which if your gym is in full and you've been open for longer than 30 days, this is for you.
13:52
Alright.
So I hope you're having an amazing amazing.
Um, day and I will catch you on the flip side tomorrow.
Maybe in a second.

0:18
Good morning everyone and welcome to Jim Secrets podcast.
My name is Alex.
And what you're going to be talking today about is is the secret firing script.
And so I know this is one of the sexy one.
But it's one of those tough loved ones that a lot of times you have to do even talking about training sessions recently and managing a team etcetera, and giving you tactics that will help you improve your sessions and make you more money.
0:40
Sometimes some people are just beyond coaching or maybe they just, they're not Beyond coaching, but they're beyond the level of effort that you want to invest into them, to grow them to the, the team member that they should be.
And so, A lot of people really hate hard conversations and it's a lot of times it's because we don't have the formula for how we can approach them and after having managed a lot of trainers in my day.
1:06
Good, bad, ugly, Etc.
I've dealt with a lot of things trainers.
You know, stealing product stealing cash, you know, sleeping with clients showing up late, you know, showing up late or no, no, no show, no call, no showing for the 5:00 a.m. session, like I get it.
1:24
All been there.
Okay.
And I've dealt with all of them and the way that This is, this is my incredibly simple firing script and it works amazingly well.
So first, from an HR standpoint, you have to make sure that if you ever do have grievances with an employee, you need to have them noted and documented, you both sign off on them.
1:44
So that there's a clear understanding and you should do that.
Anyways, just because like, if you don't like something your trainers doing, you need to articulate that to them.
Right?
Does need to be trainer, could be a, you know, an admin or whatever, right.
Same thing.
But it has to be articulated that they know, right?
That's just being a fair can be right.
2:00
But If you have done that, if provided, you have had that and, you know, they've had one or two or three strikes, or whatever it is, right, what you say to them.
Is this Hey, so-and-so employee.
See, they just sat down with you have your quick small talk and for me I'm usually really, really director this.
2:19
I'm like, hey, I'm not I'm not one to make I usually say like I'm not going to make a lot of small talk but here's the deal.
You know, you know, employee x y z that we are trying to and then project your big Vision we're trying to help hundreds of families, Take Back Control their health and we're trying to make it as easy simply possible for them to take this little thought and effort to the highest likelihood of success.
2:42
Right.
And they're going to say yes I understand that he really does because you're positioning the decision in for the for the health of the business as a whole on your reminding them, what you guys are there to do, just to serve your customers.
All right?
So you say that hey you know that we're doing that, right?
And we'll say yes like awesome.
So you also know that within the last X time, six months, six weeks whatever, how long they were working for you.
3:05
You had this happen.
This happen.
This happen.
Okay?
Bad thing.
One bad thing to you about the three, you didn't show up for a session two months ago called No showed and we had a we had several customers, complain about you being on your cell phone during the session and then it happened again this week.
3:25
Now my question is, do you understand why that's a big deal?
You don't understand why that's a problem.
Okay, so we cast a big Vision, all right?
And then you say, Hey, you know, that we're trying to do that basic knowledge.
So you know, you did bad thing.
One, two, three and you understand.
3:41
Why?
That's a problem and they're going to say one of two things either they will say yes I understand why that's a problem and then you say awesome then you can understand why I can no longer have you working for us with these issues that have persisted.
All right?
So if they understand why it's a problem, then they understand the decision for you to have to let them go.
4:01
Right?
Very smooth option two.
They said they don't understand why it's a big deal.
They try to defend their position.
And you say employee one, two, three, For the reason that you don't understand why this is a big deal that I have to let you go.
And so it's this is the simplest most efficient scripted I've ever had.
4:21
And it's one of those things that probably some of you guys have someone in your business right now that, you know, is a cancer that is never engaged.
It doesn't bind to the culture that drags the other trainers down that talk, negatively about your clients, talk sneakily about you, maybe even behind your back, and if you have one of those people, their cancer and abstraction, Amazing man.
4:42
We work together in scaling.
Jim launch had a huge amazing company for real estate agents during the bankruptcy crisis and when the bottom fell out to help them, basically help customers and also help them with their own businesses.
He said great companies, never explode from the outside end.
4:57
They implode from the inside out and so it's usually that there's a cancer.
A person who's not bought into the vision, who's doesn't buy you.
It doesn't really care about your customers at all, and it's those sets of people that you need to prune out.
Out of your of your, your garden and, and get rid of them as fast as humanly possible and do not worry about the like anybody who love that one guy is usually a terrible customer as well.
5:23
So let them go do not worry about it.
I promise you that your business will grow because if you wake up, multiple mornings a week, thinking about one of your trainers or having to deal with an issue that stems from one person that person is taking up way too much attention in your life, and your business.
And you be best served by going and finding another one.
5:39
So, without further ado, Hope that was useful for you.
The world's best firing script of all time, in my opinion, just a quick recap.
Sit Them Down, cast a vision for the company, get the agreement, then site bad thing 123 that they did ask them.
5:54
If they understand why.
It's a problem.
They say they say yes, that they understand, it's probably say awesome.
They understand why I have to let you go.
If they say no, I don't understand why it's a problem.
Then you say the fact that you don't understand why it's problem is why I have to let you go.
So when we neither way, fire fire situation and it makes that conversation really structured very easy to get through.
6:12
Alright?
So I hope that was useful for you.
If you'd like to get your gym from zero to full capacity in 30 days, He's using you, Jim launch system, all you have to do is go to gym launch, secrets.com for its Lush quiz and you can check out for free case studies for how we've done this, for a bunch of gyms.
6:30
And obviously we have hundreds of other ones but those ones are you know detailed and fluffed out of all the all the pretty pictures are kind of guess.
So have an amazing day and prune your tree pruner Garden.
Leave the Villa diligent Vigilant Vigilant.
6:46
Yeah, be diligent.
Vigilant about it and I will catch you on the flip side.









0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
I'm super stoked to be I'm making this for you.
This one is hot off the press, we just finished an hour and a half long meeting reviewing.
All of our individual teammates, we have over 70 employees at Jim lunch and yes, 70 crazy.
0:43
And it was such a great example of don't sugarcoat it that I wanted to share this with you so that you guys could use some of these Frameworks to spot Talent.
When you're interviewing people spot Talent on your team, might be underutilized and then really also on the flip side, identify cancers people, who are Not serving your community or going to be blocking the growth, right?
1:06
And so how to spot talent and identify cancer?
So the one of the second tenet of Jim launches, don't sugarcoat it right?
Which means that like, at all times our job as people within a company and then also especially as a CEO, is to be a truth teller, that is what our job is.
1:23
And so, the more you sugarcoat thing, the less effective your communication is but like people don't understand it when Just not true, right?
You don't speak the truth.
And so let me, let me show you what it's like when it actually comes into play.
It's almost always when you're communicating with your team, especially about performance and how they're doing, right?
1:42
And so if someone's not doing well, oftentimes, we he and holler out its, we're trying to protect their emotions parent, trying to protect other fields, we don't want to do with some sort of reaction, should already tell you, that, that might not be the right person or that, that character trait might not be best for the role.
And so, something that we've made a mistake on over and over and over again.
2:00
Jim large and it's something that I hope that you don't need to repeat this mistake, is that we have time and time again promoted.
Someone who is an excellent technician at something into a management role and you read it in all the books and they say don't do that.
And then, here we are doing it and we've done it like in the meeting identified five different situations where he had absolute All-Star, star performers, who are crushing it in their role and then promoted them up.
2:25
And then they failed as a manager.
And I was trying to think about what, separated, the people who we it promoted up and flourished as a manager, and leader in the company, moved up versus the ones who moved up.
And then we had to fire, which is the worst because not only that you have to find a new manager but you also have to replace the star performer that you promoted, right?
2:43
It's the worst of both.
And when it really comes down to it for us, is that all of those people had Pride?
They had Egos and so when that person was from like they're the person you wanted to take everything on as an individual performer because they wanted to Strictly get themselves into the business so that the business were lying on them, right?
3:03
And so they wanted to prove how much they could do, how much they could do, how they could rise to the top, which is great, until that person starts to pressing the people underneath of them because they want known to be as good as they were, right?
That is when pride gets in a management, right?
You can see that and unfortunately, those people a lot of times with smile to your face but then behind your back will act completely differently and they think they're outsmarting You by putting on this.
3:29
Face this facade when they're not really fooling anyone, right?
And then what happens is you start to have two lines of dialogue and maybe this is real for some of you but you have two lines of dialogue.
Whenever you're talking to somebody who has a huge ego, especially if they're supporting it.
Because what happens is they think they're smarter than you.
3:46
And so when they're talking to you they're smiling and they're saying these words but with their feeling is underneath and so constantly start having this dual dialogue, that's going on at any given time and you have the passive aggressiveness that starts and so this With the worst-case scenario comes in.
You take a star performer who was a prideful start perform because they totally Crush because they wanted to rise to the top for themselves or for the company and then once they take on all these things right?
4:10
Then you do promote them then you have this passive-aggressive and then what do they do?
They start hiring people just like that, right?
There's our hiring this passive.
And so what happens is you get this, this, this pool of people who are passive aggressive and not communicating the same way and it's and then fake communication begins and the nothing real ever get set which is why By the second tenet of Jim launches.
4:31
Don't sugarcoat.
It don't gossip.
Don't sugarcoat.
Just say it.
Like it is and the easiest way.
And the best way I can think of this because I was talking to one of our directors today and they're like, how do I, how should I say this to this person?
And they had just said all of the thing.
They're like, you know what I'm really worried about.
4:47
Like if I don't promote this person at this point, how they're going to take it, I'm worried.
That's like their performance is going to suffer.
They're not they're not they're not going to want to because they're going to feel like they got skipped over all the stuff and I was like you need to look at them and say exactly.
Exactly what you said to me.
Like most times the words that you need to tell the person or exactly, you're telling everyone else on these meetings.
5:08
So to speak to people as though you were speaking behind their back.
But just say it to their face and then you will be amazed at how effective your communication will be and what's interesting is that when you do that, you actually give someone the opportunity to grow because then they actually know what you think because they know what you say behind their back.
5:25
And so one of the biggest goals that I've had in my life has been always speak to people behind and they're back the way I speak to them in person and sometimes, even when I'm at a dinner party before.
If I do ever say anything, maybe I really try not to.
I'm going to say everything.
I'm about to tell you, I have told to this person first.
5:41
So if I say, like, I really disagree with how they do fulfillment, I think they do X Y and Z wrong.
It's not like I have said that to that person.
First and I will never say something behind their back that I have not told them to the fix.
And so the same thing, if you have employees, if you have these set, these little groups that happen or you're talking to your managers, maybe about Frontline employees and you're like, well I don't know how she's gonna take that.
6:01
Tell her.
Hey Sarah.
I wanted to do this.
And so here's my thought process because of how you reacted in the past.
I didn't know how you're going to take it.
Now, you can actually have a real conversation about the issue rather than having all these like constant.
Like for lack of better term pussyfooting around the issues, right?
6:19
You get to really say it.
And then that's when you have real conversations real relationships, and then you can build Bonds in your group like real teammates, like that, you will stand there.
And you'll have each other's back and you do it.
Because everyone knows.
You a real, right?
We're always like, man, I was just so real.
Like, I mean, I see some of these things and I appreciate it, but it's just, it's just being a truth-teller.
6:40
Just say what you actually are thinking and say to your to your people.
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
6:56
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest To our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I push the partner with you.
So that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
7:16
Right.
And so to be true to the headline of this video, how to spot talent and identify cancers.
The difference between the star player, who's able to move up and managed well and lead, and the difference being the star player, who is not able to move up and manage and Lead is prod.
7:33
Because the person who has pride is not willing to grow, because in order to grow, you need to admit fault, you need to admit.
There's a deficit need to admit, there's a gap between where you are, and where you should be, or want to be.
The prideful person is always right.
There are always the smartest in the room and they have nothing left and everyone needs to acknowledge them, right?
7:53
And that is the problem.
If you feel like when you're saying something is falling on deaf ears, like I mean you grab this from Avatar like you cannot fill a cup that is already full.
If that person thinks they are smarter than you think they always have the answers, always says the books.
Like putting response, that person is a cancer.
They're talking shit about you behind your back and very likely.
8:11
They're like, they're not going to grow.
And if you put that person in charge, Watch.
Then that person is going to create a culture of that, which will literally destroy your business.
That is a promise.
So when you are hiring, those people look for the star performance and a lot of times, interestingly, this is just from our experience of hiring people who want to go from front line to lead to manager, to directors, right?
8:33
Like we've had before levels taxes to see the people who actually go through all of them.
Sometimes it's not the loudest person, sometimes it's just someone who's like medium on their loudness, like they do their work and they don't say anything.
And sometimes when we have the conversations of those people, they are willing to grow because they don't have an ego and there's a difference between being prideful and like taking pride in your work and it's semantics speaks of the English language and different languages.
8:57
Those words are different but like taking pride in your work versus being cried full, right?
One is about, I want to I want to do this for the best.
Like I want to put my best into this versus.
I am the best and therefore it is the best because it was made by me.
9:14
That's the difference.
He's so use those filters when you're looking at people in your and you're interviewing them think like and one of the best tactical things.
If you're trying to like interview someone is, is poke at that bike, give them a scenario and then ask them what they would do and then poke, why would you do that?
9:31
Why would you do that?
But why?
And the prideful person will be become annoyed.
And then they will, they will start to lash out, you'll see their pride to the right, and then you can identify those cancers early and get them out.
Right?
Not to say that somebody like that isn't smart tons of very smart.
9:49
That's why a lot of them.
You know, they were a little bit smarter than people are maybe a lot smarter or whatever as they grew up.
And so they started think they were always the smartest person in the room.
But the problem is, when you're the smartest person in the room, there's nothing left for you to learn, right?
And so if you have that mindset, it's very difficult for you to grow someone who has that mindset.
10:06
It's very difficult for them to manage a team because they don't actually want anyone to be better than them.
Whereas, when you're actually trying to grow high growth team, you need every single person to be a servant leader.
Need every single person to be willing to grow and literally put themselves out of a job and that is counter survival because survival tells you I need to get as many things on my plate as I possibly can, so that they have to keep right?
10:28
But growing in our organization means.
You need to get everything as much off of your plate coach, and grow the people underneath of you, so that you can then have a free plate and then grab the things from above, you can bring it on your own.
That is how you move up, right?
That is how you move up our company in any company.
10:44
That's growing.
Hopefully the Well, so anywho guys.
I hope that was that I before you that is watching, launch core tenet number two is don't sugarcoat it.
Our job as CEO is to be a truth teller at all costs.
Always tell the truth and if you can confront the truth people respect you for it because you're having efficient communication, you're telling them what is actually happening and then you create the platform for real growth within your team and then even with customers like this is what's actually going on.
11:11
If you're like hey this is something that's going to be a profit Center for us.
Just say it like It's not like, they don't know.
It's not like, people don't know, you know what I mean?
So like just say it and then that way, the air is cleared.
So you don't have two lines of communication, the words and the way you're really say, just say what you are really saying and then you'll be amazed at how much is your life goes.
11:29
So lots of love guys, and I hope that was available for you.
If you can drop a line on here, drop a like.
Thanks guys.
Have an awesome day.
It's not like, they don't know.
It's not like, people don't know, you know what I mean?
So like just say it and then that way, the air is cleared.
So you don't have two lines of communication, the words and the way you're really say, just say what you are really saying and then you'll be amazed at how much is your life goes.
So lots of love guys, and I hope that was available for you.
If you can drop a line on here, drop a like.
Thanks guys.
Have an awesome day.

Most Nation real quick.

Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
0:17
I wanted to make this video for you because I saw a post by Nicole race and she said, you know, she she was saying how she has seen herself.
Give herself the label of like, I'm Good Under Pressure.
Which basically, for her in her business was like, she kind of coasted until she needed to and then she would double down and get, you know, GSD, right?
0:40
And get it done.
And I wanted to tell you the story because like, when I, when I tell you, the things that I've messed up and, like, all the things that we've learned in gym watching that we share with the gym owners.
Just like, I've literally made every one of these mistakes.
And so I have the scars like none of these were like I read it in a book and I want to share with like this, like I'm I've messed up so many things and so I just don't want you like the only advantage that we've ever had.
1:03
Is that like I'll just try not to make the same mistake twice.
So let me tell you, the story of how I was able to overcome the thing that she was explaining.
So when Leland are started out with Jim lunch and we're obviously, you know, we had the gyms and sold them and now we're doing General X, and this is the very beginning.
1:21
So, we're talking three months, four months in a gym, lunch, Russell saw what we were doing and saw that we'd had this explosive growth and half the time.
It was just Layla, it was me Layla and I think we had one other employee and this may not seem real for you and I say this with no intention of bragging, I'm just trying to give you relative scope, I think we were doing about 250 to 300 thousand dollars a month from our kitchen table and it was, you know, basically 90%, you know, margin and I was like, and we had just gotten married and we were going into the summer and like life was good, you know what I mean?
1:56
Like, don't get me wrong like we were crushing and we were working, and you know what I mean?
But like life was good like things were working and I got invited to the Pirates.
Cove Mastermind, which I've mentioned a couple times in the past, which was its kind of this thing.
Did he pay you?
Pay, 10 grand or whatever and you go there for three days and it's for it was for ten guys who were doing eight figures more and we weren't doing it figures, obviously.
2:20
So I was like, why don't we get it?
But thanks.
Anyways, Russell.
So anyways, everybody goes up and kind of shares their learnings and whatnot and it was honestly one of the most impactful.
Experiences of my life and a big turning point for our business and it wasn't because we got any tactics from three days of all these people sharing tactics.
2:38
It was because of one exchange that happened and it changed both lay on his life.
And so we went up there and you know, everyone was, you know, we better and cooler and richer and all that stuff than we were because I had been basically Faith facing bankruptcy like seven months prior.
2:55
So I was like, I'm just happy to be here.
You know what I mean?
And so we got up there and you know, I've shared all my cool stuff and I was like, so this is the supplement company that I'm planning to watch.
This is this is June have like two years ago.
3:12
This is a someone coming up planning on launching and this is how I'm going to do it and all the stuff and, like, the room was silent.
Like, you could have heard a pin drop.
And I was like, what did I say?
And Jason flatland who had been taking like vicious notes, the whole time and Jason, was I think the most successful from a monetary standpoint in the room He's a huge affiliate marketer, probably like 11.
3:37
I mean, one of the best in the world won't, you know, he's, he's renowned for doing.
I think he did 9.7 million in a day of commissions that was just his commission's.
He did 27 million in one day of sales for one of his launches.
So the guys about us and he's actually like maybe Jason will never read that.
3:54
Hear this.
But like, Jason Jason's, like a character, like Jason Jason's weird, and I don't think he would mind me saying that in a good way.
Like, he's weird and just like, started reading when he was like six months old like that.
You know what I mean?
He's he's an interesting dude.
Anyways, he just like he like he just like look super puzzled and like everyone's looking at him because everyone can tell like he's Gathering his thoughts to like just like say something significant and he's like if what you're saying is true, like if you're actually getting these types of results for Jim's, he's like you have 100 million dollar business.
4:30
And I was like and then everyone started saying like how we like how we were just missing this huge opportunity and how will I we were being idiots and I was like okay cool like great like huge feel like huge feelings of insecurity and failure you know?
I mean like I could feel my gut like this feel like rising to my throat and and so they could kind of you know saying like forget your supplement thing like you need to do this and kind of go all in on this and go even more and because we were getting positive return on ad spend and Our customers and every Mustang and they were like dude this is amazing.
5:02
And so what happened and I'm going to tie it to Nicole's thing is that, you know, after the break or whatever, Jason came like beeline straight for late last night Leo and I were already kind of stressing because of whatever what it said really shit.
And this week, we're not that cool.
Like we're actually failing because we're we're so small based on the size of the opportunity that all these people see.
5:22
Right?
And so he comes up to us and he gets like really close to our flight to our like to my face but like Leila's right now.
EXT to me and he's like when it gets easy, is when you need to lean in and he said it like, like violently.
He was like, this is where you need to go hard.
5:40
This is where you need to 10x and he's like.
So, because we were talking about how like life is actually really good.
We're like, things are great.
Like, you know what, I mean?
We're making money.
Like we, you know, like we just got married, like things are fantastic.
And he's like, If you were, if what you were saying is true, he's like someone will come in who is much bigger and badder than you and will take everything you have and it just like shook us to our core.
6:08
And it, instilled in us the sense of urgency that has not left to this day, which was when it feels easy, is, when you need to go harder, Hey, if you're a return listener and you have not rated or reviewed the show, I want you to know that you should feel absolutely terrible about yourself and everything else in the world getting.
6:28
But it would mean the absolute world to me.
If you guys would go ahead and do that, you don't have to pause the show, you keep listening and you can just do with your thumb right now.
It'll take you less than 60 seconds.
And like I said, the only way that podcast arose through word of mouth and this is you joining hands with me and helping as many entrepreneurs with possibly can because no one is coming to save us, it's just us.
6:44
All right, so please go do that now then let's get back to the show.
And so, for those of you who struggle with momentum, like being like, I only get it done when it's under pressure.
I think it's because like taking a macro step back and realizing you're always Under Pressure because it's not just like, like, if the pressure is self-induced because you have bills or you have the payroll or you have XYZ read, like if it's self-induced, you can only create so much urgency, right?
7:15
But when it becomes Market induced and problem, induced based on the customers.
The cause that you're serving, then you feel this tremendous sense of pressure at all times that you're not doing enough and in some ways and I'm going to be really real with you in some ways.
7:30
It just makes you feel inadequate at all times, which is a choice, you were aiming.
That's whether you want that or not, but that's how I feel.
Always is like, why, like, why isn't this going faster?
Why aren't we doing more wise in this than thing done yet?
Why isn't it released?
Why is the likewise the training?
7:46
Not dialed anymore.
Why did some people have problems?
Why did you know what I mean?
Why is this?
Not working for 100% of people.
Like, these are the questions that I know our team with and they come back with, you know what I mean?
Like, and that's the fight.
Right?
But if you're always like, man, how can I keep the momentum, how can I keep the foot on?
8:02
This is one of the biggest things that like irks me, right?
And this is why I talk about work.
When we make a lot of times, I see gym owners who make money, and they only make money up to the point of what their limit of how much they believe they should make is, and the reality is, and this is one of Layla sayings, not mine.
8:19
She says success is deserved by no one, it's only earned and so a lot of us have these limiting beliefs around success in around money and I'm going to, I'm going to tip talk from a different way than I normally do.
We think that we've done all of these terrible things in our life, I've done tons of terrible things, horrible things to people.
8:39
I've loved to friends to ex-partners.
I've done horrible things, right?
And there's tons of people who say, And so you have this track record of all the things of all your sins.
You know what I mean?
That you keep in the back of your mind and those things limit what you believe you deserve, right?
8:58
And so on a subconscious level, we say this is enough for me to satisfy my needs.
We talk the talk of wanting more of wanting growth but like what we believe the things that we truly believe the ones that we never question.
The real beliefs are the ones that we don't talk about it.
9:14
Don't think about because they're so ingrained, right?
And so, Like Leila says this from a success standpoint, like from a money standpoint.
You don't deserve it.
We are all like, we all fall short, we are, we've all done.
Horrible shit to people.
9:31
Like we all don't deserve it, but if you want it anyways, you just have to earn it.
And the cool thing is that, there's actions that you can take, despite the fact that you don't deserve it, that will still result in you getting it.
Right.
And I think if you think about it like that, then it all of a sudden becomes under your control, right?
9:49
And so when it gets easy, when you have that, Campaign that starts running and starts doing well, Double Down, Right?
Double down.
Don't find any think I'm covered for this month, right?
I see it time.
And again, I don't know what happened.
10:05
I was crushing it for a few months and then you got lazy and I don't want to say lazy, you got complacent, you stepped off the pedal and then got distracted because of the owns like the stories that you tell yourself.
But I'm telling you like, think about what the hunter like.
Think about the best investor in the world.
10:22
Think about Warren Buffett, you think if he sees Outsiders Returns on something?
That that's the point where he says, alright guys, who we gotta return, great job.
He's like, put everything in it, that the farm, right?
Go all in.
And so, when Jason flatly and pulled us aside and he said it like so menacingly, he was like, everything you have is going to be taken from you by someone unless you, you 10x tomorrow.
10:50
Like when it feels easy is when you need to go hard and I just it like he said it so like it like felt like he was piercing our souls when he said that because both Layla and I were like like our chest tightened up.
And like we went to the room to like decompress and like we like sat there in silence just being like, Shit he's right and so then that's when the next month we did 475 the next month we did. 750 the next month we did a million the next month we did 1.3 the next month we do 125 and we just kept going right?
11:24
And if you have this where you're like cool I got some Ieft Freedom number.
I have now covered all my expenses and I have hit my goal right?
You satisfied, you but the market conditions and things are Dynamic and they will change which means that you are always at risk.
11:40
Unless you are evolving, right?
We are making massive strategic changes on the demand side that are going to be rolled out in the next six months that we're talking about, I have my cute, my q1 meeting in 30 minutes, right?
There were going to be talking about with all of our directors and they're going to be rolling out over the next six months for the team because I'm preparing for the things that are going to come that I can see right.
11:59
Big changes in the marketplace so The way to not get caught, flat-footed is to always assume that someone's taking you out.
And then when that happens, you'll never be surprised.
And it'll also allow you to have disproportionate returns for your time and effort, because when it does get good, you get greedy.
12:19
And that's what you should do.
Like Warren, Buffett says, when everyone gets greedy, I get nervous and whenever we need to nervous, I get greedy right now, we're in a time of prosperity.
We've had 12 straight years of growth from an economic standpoint.
I believe, big things are coming that aren't going to be good.
12:36
And I think that a lot of gyms are going to be caught flat-footed, if you're struggling now, just wait.
So that being said, you need to dial in.
You need to go all in, you need to get tight where you're sloppy, you need to see where you're getting out.
Sighs for turns and go all in on those outsized returns because they're going to pay for things, where you don't have leadership, where you don't have solid team members, you need to correct them.
13:00
Now like there's no reason for you to wait.
Like, what limiting beliefs do you tell yourself a why?
My team isn't good enough right?
Like why is that okay?
And stop believing it.
So I hope my story of Jason flatland changing my life.
Thank you Jason.
13:15
We appreciate you and obviously hopefully the community gyms that we've been able to impact.
As a result, there's a huge community of people in your life and your communities that are not being impacted because you decide to get complacent.
As soon as things get a little bit, less stressful.
And that's when you need to go on.
13:32
So I hope you have an amazing Thursday, an amazing rest of your week.
My gym Lords.
I'll talk to you guys tomorrow and program housed an amazing day and tuning in.









0:00
What's going on, everybody?
I'm bringing some more books, but I wanted to say that, if you haven't checked out Hunter million-dollar offers, I would definitely suggest that you start there.
I've gotten some solid feedback and it couldn't be happier with its.
Number one ranking on Amazon for direct marketing and over 5,000, five star reviews.
So, thank you guys so much for that.
0:15
It's 164 pages.
I really can help you out.
It takes about four hours to get through, check it out.
On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
The audiobook is Lowe's, they'll let me put it on for it, so I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
What?
Is going on everyone.
0:32
I wanted to make a quick video video for you guys putting on guys, you're consuming this or podcast about why Jim's fail and so I've been doing a lot of looking into this recently because I've been looking into what Jim's did and change during the recession of 2007, 89 to adjust.
0:50
And oftentimes, the things that happened during those periods of the things that really boost profitability because it's like only one, there's lots of constraint.
Do we get to see like massive changes in How they, how we conduct business, right?
And so the number one reason that micro gyms fail is because they don't know what business they're actually.
1:08
And that's because they lack context.
And so some of you guys may know, just from the industry data that that I've pointed out that like Lifetime Fitness is, is like $99 a month.
Equinox is starts at $99 a month and a lot of these nicer gyms are at $99 a month, which means that they're in shooting distance of the industry, average price.
1:29
Point for Crossroads, bootcamps semi-private cities, Etc.
Which is $189 a month, right?
That's the actual average not what people say, but that's the actual average.
And what's interesting is that, if you look at what those types of facilities offer, so most of them have high intensity training classes, CrossFit classes, are they call them like, cross training or whatever they want to call them, but basically, it's CrossFit, right?
1:52
And so they offer comparable services to what we as micro Jam, owners are offering, except they also have Marble bathrooms and beautiful, countertops and massive hundred thousand square foot facilities with beautiful equipment, and daily usage, gyms and nice lockers and all of these things that we don't offer, and they're offering it at $20, $30 less per month.
2:16
So sometimes we think that we're like, well, we're we offer the best classes, We don't, you know what I mean?
Like they have really high P trainers that they do the same things as your trainers to write.
And so like I want to be like super real about like why Jim's actually fail and I think it's lacking context into what business you're actually in.
2:35
You're not in the Fitness business, despite the fact that you have Fitness classes at your facility, I'm going to say it again.
You're not in the Fitness business, despite having Fitness classes, your facility, because people wanted that, they would go to the nicer facility that has equal or better.
2:52
Training classes with better ancillary Services, the juice bar, the nice bathroom.
The huge gym that goes with it so that if they want to do an extra workouts, they can the pool, the racquetball court, all of that stuff for less money than your charger, right?
So, what business are you actually in?
3:09
And so, a lot of time, a lot of, for those of you who, like, nor stuff, there's three main things that we sell in the console rights, Fitness, Nutrition accountability.
All right.
Those are the three things.
Now, some of those places don't offer the nutrition, so, A plus point that we have, right?
That's one other thing that we're doing, we're approaching the person from a holistic standpoint.
3:28
The third thing is accountability, right?
And so accountability is, is the is the overarching umbrella, but it's the main value.
Add that you really offer as a facility and the reality is that a lot of people are like, yeah, we have a community and that's when people stay for and that's what they love.
And that's true.
3:44
That is actually why people are coming, but most gyms aren't actively doing anything to actually Foster.
True accountability.
And so they're surprised when they consistently have 10% plus month-over-month turn or they can't get people who go on trial as or front and programs to stay, right?
4:03
And it's because the actual thing that you're providing is not any better than what those people can get at lifetime or Gold's who have their own, you know, CrossFit version.
Like all these gyms have adapted to that.
They've Incorporated all of the large group, Barbara large group, high-intensity, all that stuff is there like it's It's done.
4:23
And so if you want to compete, right?
You have to know what game you're competing at, right?
And so the things that you're actually selling the things that people actually come for are not the, they're not the sessions, that's not why they're coming.
That's not why you get to charge 150, $200 a month plus, right?
4:41
That's not why that's not why, it's because if they don't show up, you reach out to them.
It's because if they have a birthday or someone dies in their family, you send them flowers, it's because you write them a handwritten card every month.
It's because you offer premium service, not premium classes, not premium facility because you don't, let's be real.
5:04
You don't like you're like, no, we're better.
You're not like, just, you're probably not.
I'm just being really probably not because you have access to the same trainer pool except there's more prestige in saying that you're a personal trainer at lifetime or personal trainer Equinox.
Then it is saying I'm a personal trainer at, you know, Joe's Fitness.
I'm just being super real with you.
5:21
There's not more He's there, right?
And they have more opportunity for one-on-one trainers.
When I'm training clients, who are probably higher.
SES, socioeconomic status like more income, right?
So there is more opportunity for a lot of those trainers there.
So, like, so why would someone work for you?
Why would they be better at their?
Probably not.
5:36
And so, if the only competitive advantage that you have is your accountability and your premium service, are you actually offering premium service?
Probably not and for everyone who does not understand that.
That's actually the game you're in.
5:53
That's actually the game we're playing.
That's what we that is.
Our competitive Advantage.
You're going to lose real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it, should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
6:13
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you, or how Were you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing?
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
And so right now, if you don't have processes in place to make sure you hold your members accountable, to make sure that if they don't show up by Wednesday, you're checking in with them, to make sure that you're touching base with them, at least twice a month outside of the classes.
6:40
Just to see, hey, Paul check how you doing.
Hey, how's life?
How's everything going?
Right?
This is Maggie.
You can also hide a Maggie if you If you don't have those those processes in place then what game are you playing right?
Do you know the game that you're trying to win at and might actually be and so I wanted to just make this because a lot of people aren't sure what game they're playing or they think they're playing a game and they could consistently or losing in there.
7:05
Like, why am I losing members?
Our classes are so great.
Everyone says that our classes are awesome.
No one cares, right?
Like no one cares.
It doesn't matter.
It's about everything that is not in the class.
It's everything outside.
Of the fitness.
The fitness is what they come for, it's the burger, right?
7:20
But everything else is why they stay, right?
That's what separates your facility from Lifetime from Gold's X fit from, you know, Equinox.
Because if you're just competing on that one level, you're going to lose like, you are, like, like we can't compete on a facility basis, right?
7:38
If you're like, that's why I want guys, like I'm gonna go spend all this money and equipment, like you're not going to win, even if you put 30 Grand in equipment, you're still not going to win.
That's not the game, right?
Like They spend 10 million on a facility and then they ask for a hundred bucks a month.
You're not dropping that right?
Like you're not going to beat them at that game.
7:54
So don't play that game, you're not going to beat them at the great sessions game.
I mean, you should have absolutely could corrode your trainers and they should be knowledgeable and they should be friendly.
And they should say everyone's name when they come in, which is something that some of the Big Jim's don't do because they don't know who they are, right?
But like, you need to take that personalization aspect, that accountability aspect that Community aspect, and put it on steroids.
8:14
Like if you're not running members events, what are you doing?
You know what I mean?
Like if that's your like, we're here for the community, but you don't have community events like we're all about family except you don't have, you don't know everyone's name and your trainers.
Don't everyone saying they don't.
Welcome to the Monday when they come in, like, like we really care about our members.
8:30
But when your members actually have life events, you're not writing them handwritten card.
You're not sending them flowers.
You're not, you don't even know, right?
So do you or do you say it or do you do it?
Is it actually part of your business or are you doing it on a regular basis?
You have processes in place so that it's consistent, right?
8:46
And that's the game.
That's the game or in.
And so if you don't know what game you're playing, it's really hard to win, right?
And so, I'm just making this video for you, for those of you who are might not who might be new to our community, right?
Welcome.
But that's the game we're playing.
And if you are not playing that game, you're going to lose and always wonder what what's going on.
9:04
My sessions are so great.
I'm such a good trainer.
I don't know why people aren't saying it's because your classes don't matter.
That's not why they say that's not why they come.
Well, they come a little bit because that's they don't know, right?
But that's not.
They stay because if you look at the comparisons that they have, every other gym will beat you in virtually other ever category, that some people are trying to compete at to play the right game and optimize your business around the Competitive Edge that you actually have.
9:30
And that is the game that we play in.
That is how we have premium services, and that is how you retain members and that is how you make a robust business.
That isn't that doesn't waver when someone loses a job.
When someone gets a decrease in pay, when the economy turns down whatever, right?
9:47
Because you're such a higher.
Like you're so high on the hierarchy of needs for that person that they'll do anything to stay in it.
Does that make sense?
So, if you don't have those things in place, if you're not reaching out your members by Wednesday, if they haven't showed up, if you're not regularly like providing value to them outside of the gym, if you're not creating member events, if you're not doing things for charity with them so that they can feel part of something bigger.
10:11
If you're not recognizing them by name, if you're not writing handwritten cards to them every month.
So show them that you appreciate if you're not celebrating the life events that happen outside of the gym to show that you are more than just a GM, then you're going to lose.
And so I would like you to Loose.
So that is my recommendation.
10:28
If you all are on here thank you.
Say some of the things that you guys do to show that you go above and beyond on the non Fitness side because that is the game we're in when the premium service game or not in the fitness game.
All right guys, lots of love and I will see you guys soon.









0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
What's going on everyone?
Happy Thursday, hope you guys.
Have an amazing week so far.
I wanted to start this one with something that was a little bit more of an incendiary title lbos, are the future.
And I'm saying that, because most people who have been a part of our community, been a part of our world know that.
0:46
I don't talk much about lbos are rather.
I guess I do talk about them but I'm always kind of bashing against them and part of that is just for marketing just to be a little bit more polar, but the other side is Kind of realizing that.
1:04
Where you are in the context of your business and with the lifetime value of your customer, looks like it, any given point.
What's up?
Kate is going to dictate how you acquire.
So, when Jim want started, we like Jim lunchtime lunch.
We actually had people pay half and half or paid in full up front and I had to work with a financing company at the time which I really didn't like it was kind of like one of those higher risk financing company.
1:31
So people ended up having to pay like 25% more.
By using this financing company but it was the only way that would be able to get paid up front.
And the thing is, is that over time, what should happen is that the lifetime value of the customer, should start stacking, it should start kicking in overtime.
1:50
And so over time, we had Jim's who started with Jim launch and then they started staying on the back end and they'd stay with us.
And so, the revenue that came in from those people, from recurring, continue to grow at a certain point.
We not need to ask for half and half or paid in full up front.
2:07
We were able to do longer more extended payment plans which means that we're basically lowering the barrier to entry, right in the lower, the barrier to entry, the more people who can enter, right?
And so I use the title lbos or the future because But right now, we're Jim launches, we have like a thousand dollars to start, and then people get two weeks, I think of grace period to make sure that they're making money so that they can afford the second real payment that they have, right?
2:39
And so it's actually like we super have spread it out over time.
So that basically anyone can do it and so we have client finest acquisition, which is what we preach with most of the gems that come in with us because most of them don't have the recurring.
I stacked up in order to allow them to basically lower that barrier to entry.
2:58
And so the big problem that happens is that when small gyms market like Big Jim's, that's where they get into trouble because when you lower the barrier to entry or lowering your cash upfront, York immediate cash per customer and then what that does is it puts more stress on the business, right?
3:15
If you have the cash reserves or you have stacked up the retention and the recurring that's coming from these customers, then you can Lbos that actually work.
And so I do kind of poo poo and I did poo poo for very long time.
The whole lbo model and it's mostly for from a marketing standpoint because it doesn't really match the reality of 99% of the gyms that are struggling or even just not growing or they want to be right?
3:40
And it's because if you're losing money in the acquisition, then it's really hard to Market unless you have a lot of cash and most people aren't in that space, right?
But you guys love that you're listening?
To the podcast if you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects more visuals, more graphs, you don't drawn out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
4:04
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, If you're referring starts kicking up, if your lifetime value of a customer starts, really stacking, then you can continually lower and lower and lower the bar to the point where your cash flow negative for two weeks, four weeks, six weeks.
4:26
So like Jim launch.
For example, when we acquire a gym, we're cash flow negative for the first six weeks.
So, six weeks from the time somebody opts in to the, to there to that point, you know?
What are the six week we're in - in the acquisition and then we start making our first dollar of profit.
4:48
And what that's allowed us to do is basically take over the entire Market because we don't need to ask for all this money up front.
We don't need to do all these things because we know that our average customer is going to stay for a very, very, very long time.
And so right now, like if we had no money that came in from Jim watch the recurring that we just have from the base of customers that we have already served, would still provide us, a 60-70 percent.
5:11
Plus margin for operating business.
Which is crazy, right?
But it didn't happen overnight.
It took time to get there and we took steps from going half and half, and Paving fools to, you know, three pays to okay, everything's more upfront.
Let's see.
Like let's do you know three or four thousand down and then thousand whatever and so like we've continually lowered what we asked for on the front end from a cash standpoint to continually lower the bar, so we can get more volume in but you have to do that with an ion.
5:41
How much cash does coming in from your current?
If you never solve your attention problem, you'll never be able to scale at a massive at a massive level, right?
You'll never be able to do that.
And so that's why some of the plays that we have a legacy.
5:58
For those of you who are on here, lower the barrier to entry like the green play so that we can get more people on recurring faster.
We get less cash up front but we should if your retention is Wrong, be stacking, five to ten thousand a month in recurring revenue.
6:16
And when that happens, that's when the game really, really, really gets funky.
And that's really the goal that everyone should be shooting towards.
But ironically, how you do the very back.
Back back, end affects how you do the very, very, very front front front.
And so, it really does kind of come full circle in terms of how you look, it acquisition and how nothing happens in a vacuum, right?
6:39
And so I say lbos are the future.
Because in a lot of ways, they are one of the most effective ways of growing a business.
But 99% of people don't have a business is strong enough that they can actually use LL be 0 without going under and that's the fundamental problem.
6:55
And so we have to do client Finance acquisition on the front end, get more per customer so that we can outspend everyone in the beginning and be cash flow positive in the acquisition so that we have the cash flow to then take and then reinvest in building up.
7:11
The services customer service systems, Etc.
So that we can get the lifetime value high enough that we can actually lower the front end.
So I hope that makes sense.
I hope that was Nieto for you and that should give you an idea of what the goal is.
The goal over time, should be absolute volume and maximizing lifetime value.
7:31
So if you maximize the lifetime value that you want to lower the barrier as much as you can, so you can get as many people into that lifetime value as you possibly can, but you have to keep an eye on the cap, cash realities, the business.
And so that's where the Seesaw the balance point between how much cash you asked for a front, and then how many people you get seesaws and that's really the whole game.
7:51
So anyways, I thought that would be Nieto for you.
Thanks Chris, appreciate that.
Last load everybody.
Hope you guys an amazing Thursday and if you wouldn't mind drop a like and a comment and I'll be sure to like and comment on your comment back.
All right.
And this may seem big guys and I'll catch you guys soon.









0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
The inspiration for today's podcast, podcast /video editor, It is a conversation.
I was having with dr.
Kashi about a post I made in his group and whether your aunt is group, efficacy is awesome, he's super PhD, brilliant world record holder, all that stuff, and he was talking about how a lot of people physiologically.
0:46
Don't know the difference between maintenance and doing it.
They need to do to massively gain muscle, right?
And so he's like the difference between the stimulus necessary in order to grow and adapt.
Versus just maintain our dramatically different.
1:03
And so like the amount of the amount of effort you need to put into maintaining muscle is so much less than what you need to do to gain muscle.
That most people see, this huge gap and so it got me thinking because the the article that I posted inside of the inside of the group was an article about how I gained 35 pounds in six weeks and I put 100 pounds on my bench in that same period and it was kind of by thinking through the framework that I want to share with you, which is If I use the exact same framework to game the GMAT at Harvard and so I wanted to get into Harvard at a certain point in my life for their MBA program.
1:39
And so I took the GMAT and I think I got a sick something on it, like the first time.
And I was like, oh crap.
I don't like in there and like the average score to get in, with 720.
And so, I was like, man, how am I to get?
And that's like a 99%, you know, percentile in order to do that, what I'm going to do here.
1:57
And so, the This is basically that I went through was trying to figure out what is the input output Ratio or response that you need to figure out within any goal that you have.
And then once you've established with that formulas, you just go all into it, right?
2:15
And so, for the GMAT, I found this graph when I was researching people who had high scores and like, what things they were doing, and it turned out that I saw this graph and it had a linear relationship between number of Problems done, practice problems, done and score on the Gmail.
2:34
So, as Linens though, the more problems you did in practice, the better your score was and I was like, this is awesome because this means that all I have to do is put as much into this side and then I'll get that side to go up.
And so what I ended up doing was I had 16 weeks and so I want 16 phone books of problems.
2:53
So for those of you ever like took dancing to your, the ACT, those books are like this, right?
And it's just problems and so I did one Book a week for the 16 weeks you're taking about 30 hours of book.
I would do four hours a day during the week, and then I would be five or six on Saturdays and Sundays of straight problems and I would do one test every week which a live test is like three hours.
3:14
And so I just made it my full time job besides my full-time job, right?
And then lo and behold 16 weeks later, I sort of 740 which is 20 points above Margaret.
It Harvard's, MIT score, and so people here that are like, Alex must be super smart but it's like, I mean, Like, if everyone saw what went into it, they probably wouldn't say that.
3:32
You know what I mean, it was just like a Herculean amount of effort, and so the same thing with the the muscle thing, right?
Is I put 35 pounds on, I put 100 pounds on my bench and everyone's like minox, genetics are awesome.
And I purposely preach the fact that my genetics are awesome because I want to reinforce that in myself because I want to believe that I get more out of my output than anyone and I believe in the placebo effect and I want to feed into that as much as I possibly can, but I was really small for the first ten years of my training.
3:59
I was a powerlifter.
I broke a few State records at 181 in Maryland, 181 pounds and 5 11 and a half was not jacked, you know what I mean?
Like I look like I barely worked out.
I'm 2:30 now, and what it took was a friend of mine, great Knuckles, talk to me, and say, hey man and I really trusted Greg and I knew, I mean, I felt like I knew a lot about training at that point mr.
4:23
Records.
I felt like I was pretty strong but Greg was much stronger than I was and I was like, huh?
And Griggs.
Also, one of the probably three people in my life.
I've met who I thought was like a true genius and Greg was like, it's basically impossible for you to over train.
He's like, you can physiologically do it.
4:40
He's like it's just not practically possible for most humans and I was like, really he was like yeah he was like so pretty much the more volume you do.
The more muscle you'll gain there are diminishing returns but you still get returns right?
And so it was just like the math problem are the problems with the GMAT, which was I continue to get better as I did more problems.
5:02
Obviously the the the difference between My Week 1 and week 2 score was the biggest difference I had because I just learned how to take the test and pace and all that kind of stuff, you know?
I mean, in week two and three had another good game, but like the difference between week 15 and 16, I might have only gained five points or 10 points on the test but it was still gain, right?
5:19
And so like people who are Olympians do there, you know, fight their entire lives for diminishing returns, they're still returns.
And despite the fact that their diminishing returns, Sometimes the actual reward for the diminishing returns is the opposite exponential and so you get these diminishing returns but the reward is opposite because for every inkling that you get, you might be moving forward by a huge percentile in terms of where you sit on the track with everyone else and if and the the last margin the last decimal that moves you from number two to number one in the world has some of the biggest returns but it's the smallest actual returns from a performance standpoint.
5:58
Point.
So, just something to think about, but what I do with the, the harbor GMAT score, I mean, 16 books.
Like this is what I'm trying to use my hands here, but this is for books.
I did four times this in the 16 weeks to prepare for the test, right?
It's a lot plus a test every week that I do on top of that for the muscle thing.
6:18
As soon as Greg told me that I basically couldn't overtrain my new objective was to get my body to essentially believe it was under attack.
And so I wanted to put it in this huge State of stress, right where it had was forced to adapt, right?
6:33
Like it was either going to adapt or break, right?
And that was in, there's this fine line between the two of those that I tried to walk, right?
And so he basically like volume is the main driver.
So like because out of the power lifter by trading, so I always wanted to go high intensity with everything but he's like in terms of the like you just have to be 65 plus percent of your max for like the the sets to count more or less.
6:58
He's like in pretty much if you're above their, you're good and so trying just do as much volume as you possibly can at those weights.
And so I started just doing seven sets of 20 every day with bands on the leg press and then 42 days later which was really was 42 workouts.
7:16
Later, I gained more muscle than anyone even thought possible muscle, and fitness, picked up, the article on was like they made it.
It had like 12 hundred shares and I did it without gear.
I choose to believe that or not, but like, at that, like that point in my life, like I did it without here, and I was lifetime natural.
7:37
And so, I just a massive amount of beings and after, like, after that happened for me, that dramatically shifted, how I train for the rest of my life because I saw what was possible in a short period of time.
If you literally put your body into this environment, where it's forced to adapt.
7:53
Because I wanted my body to think that it's job, like my new life was just lifting weights every day.
And I was like, I feel Figure.
If I made my body think that I was lifting weights every single day for my job, it will grow and it will look like it's job is to lift weights every single day First Sight, right?
8:10
And so, to tie this into why this might be useful for you, is that when Trevor and I were talking about this, a lot of the gym, Lords decided to hop on because I challenge all of our German words between now and the summit.
I was like just trained like I did between now and the sun, which is like 30 days.
8:25
It's like training, every single muscle, every single day.
And it took me about three hours to do this, as I train every single muscle, every single day, and do it pretty much to failure and then to come back tomorrow and do it again and come back the next day and do it again.
Because what happens is your body's like oh shit, I need to adapt, I need to grow because the stimulus is greater than what I have currently.
8:45
Right?
And turbo was like I wish people just new effort actually looked like because he was like, myself included in that.
He wasn't saying that.
It's like a armchair thing.
He's like, I just wish people knew what effort look like.
Because the amount of effort that it takes to grow.
Go and break something so that he gets stronger versus maintain.
9:02
Something is dramatically different from a physiological standpoint.
It got me thinking about the same thing with the GMAT that I did.
I didn't think about it like that.
At the time, I just really wanted to get a good score, but like the same thing with business is that a lot of times, the amount of effort that it goes like that, it takes to maintain a business.
9:20
First amount of effort that it takes to grow a business, are dramatically different, right?
And so that's kind of the point of this whole video is that like, the amount like, For you to maintain your business.
It doesn't need a lot of effort.
Hey guys, real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
9:39
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype four hundred dollar leads, but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers, make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
9:56
Its fo free in exchange for email so that I can email you when we launched under million All Leads and so that you can not miss out on it because last time I sold out for like eight straight weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
For you to grow your business.
10:12
It's not going to be twice as much as your maintenance.
It might be 10 times as much, because the amount of effort that it takes to push something and break, inertia, and actually make changes.
And that's both on yourself psychologically, emotionally, etcetera, that you need to grow, right?
10:28
And then also the business itself because Downstream effects of how you have to move your entire team motivate them clearly.
Communicate the goals, put new processes in place.
All these things take a lot of effort, right?
And a lot of that effort is purse.
Keep this pain, right?
Like it wasn't fun for me to do four hours of freaking test problems.
10:46
When I was you know, 22 and I saw all my friends, you know, partying all the time because I actually left school a year early and this all my friends were like doing their senior, whatever doing their senior year and I saw these pictures of everyone like going out enjoying themselves and like I wasn't, I was freaking taking the GMAT, you know what I mean?
11:04
That's what my life was.
And that's okay.
You know what I mean?
Because I learned a lot.
I ended up not even going to Harvard anyways, but like I Lon Earned a really important lesson when I went through that four months of four hours a day plus was that like, you can do whatever you want, if you actually put enough work into it.
And I know that sounds really trite and over you, so I apologize.
11:21
But like, I think a lot of times it's the degree of effort that most people miss, you were a mean.
And like the degree of sacrifice the degree of pain that they have to go through and it's like, well, this is what it takes me to do nothing will, if I just do more than that, I'll grow.
11:38
But a lot of times that's like, especially like In lifting, it's the same thing.
Like if you if it takes you one workout a week for legs to maintain sometimes two workouts, a week aren't really is it really going to push you and get your body in a state that needs to grow, right?
Like you have to break it down to the point where it's like fearing for its life.
11:56
And that's where adaptation starts happening because the stimulus is sufficient to cause change, right?
And so it's the same thing with you, and maybe the pain that you feel right now.
I don't know who's watching this, but if you just had a really rough holiday season, I hope you didn't.
But if you did, And you're like, I don't know what I'm gonna do in January.
12:12
If you have that feeling like Let It Be the stimulus that forces you to grow and don't take it as a negative, take it as a positive because maybe this is that moment that pushed you over the edge, to get you to grow to do, what you should be doing or that you have wanted to do.
12:27
But you haven't had a stimulus that was strong enough and just like be okay, with the fact that feeling shitty might just be the precursor to getting you to feel good eventually, right?
Like my knee.
Right now because I'm doing the, I'm doing the fact, I challenge everyone to like train like Alex.
12:44
So I'm doing it too.
Like running out.
My knees are a key is how, you know what I mean?
Like and every time I walk like my knees are a key, it is not sustainable, but a lot of times the periods of growth that I've noticed in my life have not been steady.
They haven't been like this, they've been spurts and plateaus spurts and plateaus and it's been the same thing physiologically with muscle and fat loss in my life that I usually own every year.
13:07
I only gained muscle for probably two, Periods of time that are very punctuated and then the rest of the time, I'm pretty much maintaining that I have the intention to put to it, right?
So I think it's the same thing with businesses that like you have these moments where you're like, you have like you clear your plate enough that you have enough attention to go all in on this one thing.
13:26
And then you have this huge massive growth period and then it plateaus and then you and then you re-stabilize and you and you find the new maintenance of what, you know, the one time a week, you need to do legs.
I'm using the parallel between business and working out.
And then you can finally re stablish with that new formula, is going to be insert, the amount of problems that I need to do.
13:47
My test score goes up, insert the amount of volume that I do in training.
I gained more muscle insert, the amount of calls I make to reach out to leads, be more amount of money.
I make right there are these parallels and I remember when I figured out that one which the amount of Outreach attempts, I had with Leeds was directly Porsche much money on it and I was like, huh?
14:08
How about that, right?
Like there are plenty of like the the amount of sales conversations that I have is directly proportional to my closing percentage.
There's tons of these parallels in business.
And a lot of us don't think that like don't understand what volume really means.
14:24
And so volume like you might think like well if I so you know, five people a week, well that's might just be maintaining your sales skills.
You might have to up to 30 people a week in order to really put a new stimulus on.
On your brain and give it enough attention in enough reps and enough practice to actually achieve a new level of Mastery for that skill, right?
14:44
Same thing for reaching, that's what leads same thing for managing your team.
Maybe like you need to have one-on-ones every single day with one of your each of your team members, not just for them, but for you so that you become a better leader so that you become a better Coach, right?
Like it's the same thing and so trying to figure out the dose response relationships that are like that exist in your life, is like, literally the key to unlocking.
15:07
If you want and then being able to once you identify what the equation is be, okay with the sacrifice of what it costs to put the input in and then the period of delay before you get the output.
And so that was that was my my Trevor and Alex conversation that had this morning was it was like I feel like a lot of people don't actually know what level of effort is necessary in order to achieve the body or the muscle gains that they want and the amount of discomfort that they have to go through and I say this not to brag but I think Mostly because I'm somewhat masochistic, and because I've been, like, despite the fact that I'm kind of young, I've been training since I was 13.
15:45
Like, I had programming written out since I was 13.
And so people were like me, and you have so much muscles, like I'm training for 16 years, you know what I mean?
And I've had a young man's body to be able to train with hopefully an old man's understanding of the game.
And so it's been the balance between the two of those things.
16:03
But virtually every time someone comes to train with me and like, Lila was a trainer.
The high-level trainer before she came to start liking for she and I started dating and I'm hopefully, you know, I don't get a job in the ribs later for saying this, but Lila gained more muscle in the first 18 months of us being together than she had in the years of training for that.
16:22
And she attributed to the fact that like she just didn't know how much volume like people did.
And I've had I've had some Jim words, fly out.
I've had other people, other Fitness people who have ended up coming.
Going to like train with me and I don't do it to be special is just like this is what I'm used to now, but like I always invariably get the question.
16:44
Like are We Done Yet are like, are we going to move on to the next exercise?
Because like we're like 78 sets into this one exercise and I'm like how we got three more and they're like really like actually know again, we're going to do the same thing for the next exercise.
The same thing for the exercise after that.
Because if like I want my back to grow I need it to get to a point where it's going to like feel a stimulus that sufficient in order to feel It needs to adapt.
17:09
And so and then like the thing is, is not just doing that today, but do it coming back tomorrow when you're sore and tired, and doing it again and then coming at the next day and when you're sore and you're tired and doing it again and I think that that's what people lack from the hypertrophy standpoint.
17:28
People like Alex always has great genetics.
I don't know.
I do a lot more volume than most people do like period.
Especially people getting a weekly volume standpoint.
Maybe one guy.
Does a huge leg assault one day a week.
I do the same Assault 7 days in a row and so over the period of like 10 weeks, I literally did seven times the volume, he did, and all ended up getting was maybe twice the gains.
17:48
But in a world of diminishing returns, I still return to more.
You know what I mean?
And so the same thing with sales, the same thing with running your team, the same thing with reaching out to Leeds is like a lot of times the diminishing returns that we get are still returns.
But the amount that you get from each of the returns despite the fact they are smaller is disproportionate in the amount of game that you get in terms of skill and the in terms of how much your business can grow.
18:12
Because let's say you're running on a 15 percent margin industry, average is 8 to 12 for Jim's.
If you can just squeeze an extra 20% out of all of the system's.
I just walked in through acquisition and retention Ascension, Etc, right.
18:28
And you can push your, your margin from 10% to 30%, you just tripled your business and it seems like you're only squeezing out 20%, but in reality what that means, the business might mean a tripling of how much money you make.
And that's the difference between the Champions and the people who feel like they're working hard to put our actually, I hope it doesn't come off.
18:47
Really arrogant.
Not my intention at all.
It's just wanted to share a couple things that have helped me.
So anyways guys, I hope you guys had an amazing Christmas very restful and I hope you guys are buckling up for the Sprint between now and may that we all get to have with the wind in our sails, and still a frothy economy.
19:06
Despite the recession.
That is going to come, we still have a pretty frothy economy.
So you guys should be doubling down and pillaging and taking everything that you can between now and summertime.
So, Buckle up, get your teams ready and otherwise it's just on here, drop a comment.
19:23
Drop a like, maybe it'll be useful for some your trainers or maybe in that hard time, or maybe you were in that hard time of like, okay, I've identified the input, but I haven't seen the output yet, and that's okay.
It's part of the game and hopefully you enjoy the game because what it's all about it, guys.
19:40
So, lots of guys have an amazing day and I'll catch you guys soon.0:00
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out, if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, I have a severe a special guest with me on today.
0:22
My beautiful wife Layla Say hi.
And we're gonna be doing something a little bit different.
We have a bunch of things that we're going to be starting this coming year, doing more stuff together, because I feel like I've been doing you guys did a service in hiding Layla way in the corner, you know, like like Gollum, you don't know maybe like she's she's she's been in the corner secretly running the business and actually the making me look really cool.
0:49
And so, I thought it would be doing you guys have a service not have around here since he's really the one who's actually running and growing the business. - and not me who just pretends to take credit for it and so with the theme of it being the New Year, obviously, a lot of guys are doing goal setting and things like that.
So are we we've got all of our Agro stuff on the backboard be on here, but I wanted to or we both wanted to talk about something really grinds are years /, maybe a different approach to setting goals.
1:15
It's worked really well for us.
That you might not hear normally.
So typically, when people set goals, they're like, okay, I'm going to start doing this and I'm doing this and like, I'm To start, you know, listening to more podcasts and I need to read these books.
And I want to work with, you know, wake up earlier and I want to work out more and I want to eat better.
1:32
I like everyone has all these goals, right?
And the thing is that they're taking their plate that they have right now which is full like everyone's play at school.
Because whenever you have a vacuum and attention, it gets filled, like attention will always go find something to put itself on right now, but if you're bored, you go find something to pay attention to.
1:50
You don't like unless you're like truly meditating or something but like, most people are doing that and so if you A heavy vacuum of attention, you will fill it with something.
And so everyone is always at a hundred percent right with their attention and so when they set goals, they just basically set something on top of what they already are doing and so you can't go to 110% 120% not first sustainable period of time, and so you have to like, buckle down and like force yourself to do something.
2:16
Whereas if you make room for something then it can actually happen.
It feels naturally you know it feels natural to you to do it.
And so What we like to think about is instead of what things do we want to do?
It's what things are we going to?
Give up?
2:32
What things are we going to stop doing?
What?
Things are we going to sacrifice?
And then when we just focus on those things, the goals that we already have everyone.
Here probably has most goals, are more or less the same.
You have financial goals.
You have spiritual goals, you have romantic goals.
Like all those things are more or less the same but it's identifying the things that are on your plate that are not moving those goals forward, that you need to take off and then those goals will naturally fill in so late.
2:57
Would you like to talk more about what we're doing?
Yeah, I think one thing to kind of highlight is we're talking our team when we're building kind of the future of what each department looks like, right?
And everyone has a bajillion goals like they have 10 to 15 different goals that they know that they want to set for their departments which at this point, their departments are each probably bigger than a normal gym, right?
3:19
So these are like running a 15 to 20 percent team each and with that, you know, some of them come to us.
Like I have so many goals, I don't know how I'm going to get these done, so then it doesn't come down to a question of what goals you're going to.
Prioritize, it comes down to who do you need to bring on to take on those goals.
3:34
And so for a lot of business owners who have a ton of things on their plates, it's because you haven't made that one Higher yet, or you haven't found the right person, yet that actually should be doing those things for you.
Because as a business owner, you can't continue to take on more and more things without giving things up.
The only way to get things up so that people delegate them to write and the follow-up.
3:51
Is that like for us what we did is we have like we know that we're going to be far more public facing this coming year.
So we've sort of built this company in private like, no one really knows how big Jim Lunch really is, unless you're like in our world but like there are people who posture as though they're the same size as us except they're like half the size of just our contracts team so and so like that's that's our main goal.
4:16
How could we do that?
When we're full time running the business that were running right now?
Like we couldn't add that on top of what we're already doing.
Right.
So obviously you have to get the people in place but there's So like looking at our calendars because we have all of our time blocked out, which if you don't that's probably a good thing start doing.
If you have all your time, block that you follow a calendar, we can see OK, what things on here can I not be on?
4:37
And so we're ruthlessly saying and like when in doubt, cut it out and so like we're like, I don't know and like we're basically just cutting everything off of our calendars and then just putting these are the four meetings that we want to 100% be on and then the rest of our time.
4:52
Now we have this vacuum of attention that's open.
It up.
Now, we can go place the things that make sense as our priorities for this new year.
Yeah.
And a big piece of that is when you're looking at your calendar you know we're looking at what are these means that were on and then what department do they pertain to right?
5:09
And then whatever department they pertain to, that's the person that we should be meeting with is the director of that department or the head of that department.
Right?
Because we shouldn't have to be on any meetings if we're on the meetings more than we're coaching that person.
Then we're just putting a bandaid where it needs to just essentially Hey Mose, a nation quick break.
5:27
Just to let you know, we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright so send me a connection request.
A note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
5:46
Right.
That's like such a blank.
Hopefully everyone like caught that.
So rather than let's say, Alex sitting in on the marketing department meeting where there's also a marketing director, right?
Rather than me sitting in on that meeting.
But what happens when I'm on that meeting, everyone's going to look at me after everyone says the sentence is like, what is Alex think?
6:01
You know what I mean?
And so what ends up happening is that I can, I'm not actually giving the, I'm not delegating the decision-making, not delegating the authority, and the power to the director, who we are putting their to do those things.
But instead, I inevitably It's like because I'm me and just because you are you you were the entrepreneur, you're always going to have the final set and so everyone on the team is just going to look at you.
6:22
And then what it also does is they don't think is creatively.
They don't double check things, the way they probably should.
Because in their mind they're also thinking.
Well, if there's something wrong, Alex will catch it.
There's something wrong lane little catch it.
And they were out.
He said you were also sitting in and you're probably riding shotgun being a little bit more passive being like they've got this.
6:41
I'm just here to here to observe and so both people both parties.
Think the other party is paying more attention and then then you have like planes missing each other because no one's double-checking because everyone thinks the other person is.
And so for us now we're getting off of all of those means that we were on for the Departments.
6:58
And we're just meeting with the heads of the Departments that they can truly run that on their own and then we can coach them and help them grow through the sticking points that we just went through.
Because in reality has like the coolest thing about our business has been We've had to grow as entrepreneurs.
7:14
And so, like, since this is our first time doing it, we have we know exactly what growth beliefs we had to break going back from, you know, two three million dollars a year when we started to like now.
Like and so we know what each of those growth curves was like.
7:30
And so when these guys are now at running a department that's 20 30 people, that's the equivalent of a business, that's doing three to ten million a year, right?
And so we know what limiting beliefs we had That broke us from three to ten, broke-ass from 10, to 30 broke us from 32, you know, whatever where we're at now.
7:47
And so anyways, that's that's what we're focusing on for this new year.
And for you guys, I would, I would at least pair everything that you want to do with something that you're going to stop doing where sacrifice, in order to allow there to be a vacuum for the new thing that you're going to put in.
8:06
And you'll probably be surprised that it up it'll work out.
Well, but for you, anyways, Hopefully that was useful for you.
If you guys dug this, you know, shoot a comment you like tag someone.
This is something that we're also learning our Dynamics.
8:21
We're not usually do together.
So it's like it's fun for us to learn this and you guys will watch us to step on each other and like by each other like put my foot in her mouth or turf footed.
You know the funny thing is to we actually are on video together a lot.
It's just not facing towards it's usually facing towards the team.
8:40
Yeah that's true.
And we're also usually kind of like the same I'm framed we're like Zoom calling with like 20 other people in here.
Anyways, it'll be fun for us to learn because we're going to hopefully start a show this year.
The alexandrian the show which will be like a full full full length.
YouTube thing, we'll talk a little bit more about our business less about gym stuff that way we can separate because I know I've been talking a lot about like our business on here and I want to keep this more towards gyms and fitness, but like there's still tons of things that we're learning as we scale, this thing that I feel like we want to share Gary view said something the other day that It's been like really motivating for us from a Content standpoint.
9:15
Use like who, here would go back and watch Jeff besos, you know, packing books when Amazon was only doing ten million a year, like everyone would go back and watch those videos.
Have Jeff Bezos like talking about what his day was, like, and so, like, selfishly part of these, this like, us documenting this journey.
9:35
And so that, hopefully, when we hit the big big, you know, I mean, her started pretty big, but like the things that we want to accomplish.
We can look back and be like, this is these, this is what we were thinking.
At that point.
This is these were the thoughts were thinking, these are the growth things that we had to break at each point in our growth path.
9:52
So, anyways, hope you guys dig it.
Thank you, Prince, appreciate that.
Otherwise drop a comment down below, like and lots of help from Alexandra.0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually a pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
What's going on everyone I'm here from downtown Austin and I want to talk to you about something that has been on my mind for a little bit and today felt like the day to do it a little bit extra coffee today.
So I'm gonna try and slow down my speech.
Otherwise Let's get right to it.
So I'm pulling this never-ending sales cycle and the balance of Goodwill versus conversion.
0:36
So the first time I heard even the concept of Goodwill was from a marketing, Frank Kern, he still markets now and he talked about how the amount of money that you make is directly proportional to the amount of Goodwill.
You have in the marketplace multiplied by the amount of conversion points, you have the amount of times you ask for money.
0:52
So the amount of offers you make what's interesting about that though, is that the more offers you make?
The less food, will you have?
And so The push and pull balance between, how much Goodwill you have in the marketplace and how many offers you have?
Every time you make an offer, your Goodwill goes down but the more Goodwill you have times the amount of offers, the more money you make.
1:09
And so what does that actually mean, right?
And so, the way that we've, I think, that we've done a really good job of having Goodwill in our in our audience, in our customer base, by balancing, this fairly well, and putting a lot of attention to it.
And so, I think it's, it's kind of goes in contrast to the to the concept of like, nickel and diming.
1:29
In people.
So there's a lot of businesses that are out there that love the to upsell like, well, you know, like it, let me, let me give you an agency example, right?
So if there was a company that was agency and they're like, well, we have this is our base level and then for an extra 10% will do your creative and an extra 10% on top of that will do your copy and it's extra 10% on top of that, blah, blah, blah blah, right?
1:50
It's your nickel and diming.
Someone in order to get more money out of them.
But like, I think, what is it happening?
There is you lose a lot of Goodwill because every time you make an offer you lose, Well so it's kind of like there's a psychological binary of every time you make an offer, you're beating down Goodwill but from a monetary perspective, all offers are not created equal and the amount of money that you're going to make from every up seller.
2:12
Every offer is not equal, right?
And so if you realize that I'm trying not to get too abstract here but the amount of money that you make varies widely from what you're actually selling but the amount of times you make an offer is set.
So an offer is a 0 or 1 either you're making an offer.
2:28
You're providing value.
That's it.
Right, from a consumer standpoint but the but every time you make an offer, that's not really that monetizable that does make you a ton of money, like a nickel and dime scenario.
You're still losing a decent amount of Goodwill but you're not getting a proportional amount of upside from that from that offer, right?
2:46
And so, the way that I like see this from over our perspective, is that most times.
A lot of the things that most people would argue that you should charge for, you should still put in your Marketplace, but only as good will Now here's where it gets more interesting.
3:04
Thus, the fact that you're not going to ask for money, for the thing that you are going to be making to add value whatever, it's right.
If you're doing an adverse event or you're doing an internal challenge or whatever it is, right?
You still need to sell the shit out of it.
And what I mean by that is that like people still don't see the value of what you're doing unless you explain to them why it's valuable, right?
3:24
And so this goes both internally and externally.
So when you're talking to your team about this new thing, Thing that you're going to start doing, you want to sell them on how great is, right?
Like you have to like otherwise you're not going to be into it then they're not in turn.
Won't you emanate that enthusiasm to your clients, right?
3:42
And so in the same, in the same vein, you need to sell the clients on a why.
This thing is so good.
Because if you're going to go through the process of making something that's going to be good and fulfilling on it, you want to make sure that you get your do Goodwill, right?
3:57
And so when we're doing this, like the Goodwill the way that I see, It is that your there's two existing one?
Is that you are depositing money into a bank account, right?
You're depositing Goodwill into a bank account for later extraction, right?
You're depositing, depositing, depositing for later extraction or you can see it is building up pressure, right?
4:14
Like you're continuing to pump air into a defined amount of space, which might be your defined amount of customer base.
You're pumping air, you're pumping your coming here and then the moment you release the valve like that's when all the sales start flowing in, right?
Most Nation real quick.
4:32
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
4:51
And so that's why like when we teach like that, we want to fill people's base up before we start doing their High ticket or their semi private training is because what a build up, the pressure in the base of the business.
So that if we have 200 300 members, when we say, hey guys, we're on be offering more exclusive service.
5:07
We've built up so much Goodwill with built up so much exclusivity that automatically, that next level fills up without any effort, right?
And so that all comes from how much Goodwill you're providing.
And so, you know, gear.
Use wrote his book, jab.
Jab jab, right hook.
5:23
But basically it's, you know, what ratio, do you go?
How many times do you have to give before you can ask, right?
And it's not take its ask.
And so, I mean, being very candid.
Like this, this video series is podcast is constant.
All the stuff is me trying to put Goodwill out there and show that we're good at what we do and provide value for you in advance, hopefully make you money before weakened.
5:47
So you see that the stuff that we have really works but understanding that Still need to sell at all points in the process, to your team, to your customers, and then picking and choosing the select opportunities that actually have the most upside.
And so typically where you might have been, just going jab, ask jab asked, right?
6:08
And then asks you're not making a much from them for two reasons.
One because you haven't built enough pressure up but also because not all of the asks that you have in your business are going to be huge revenue streams, right?
Like there's a million ways too much could try and nickel.
And I'm our customers but we don't we just try and make stuff and keep providing value, keep providing value keep, providing value.
6:27
So that when it comes time, where we actually want to make a move, we've built up so much Goodwill that it blows the gasket off the top and it becomes, you know, a an overwhelming surge of business and its business in a way that that is in a maximal like converter that is being maximally converted in a maximally profitable manner rather than continually doing these little upsells and things like that.
6:51
That in the Long Haul, I think damage the brand damage, the customer relationship and don't allow you to maximally profit in the big picture from your customer base.
So anyways, I hope that provide some value for you.
I hope that when you were talking to your members talking to your gyms and if you're trying to innovate and create new things, don't, always try to monetize everything try and provide good, will be cognizant of the fact that Goodwill is what will make you the most money and pick and choose the battles that you want to monetize.
7:18
Because that is how you're going to make the most.
Money long run because you're going to have the most loyal to you can.
If you can talk about you like tea, they just keep providing value to keep over delivering and again I will just reiterate the reason that they think that there is good well is because you sell them or why it is value and so you can't just make the stuff and give it to him and just not like me really explain why it's cool you have to sell it as though you were going to charge it, charge money for it and then only then and only then say that since I love you, here it is, right?
7:48
That's the key.
That's the difference and that's what will I You position yourself in such a way that when you do want to make your move, you crush.
So lots of love.
Hope you guys have an amazing 2019 and I'll talk to you soon.









0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
So I'm calling this This, the old must die for the new to live.
And, what's that smell?
It's a concept that I think a lot of people don't grasp when they're trying to grow or change or make some changes in their business or improve themselves.
0:42
And it's, it's a question that I get all the time because for a lot of the gyms that we work with.
We recommend a radical switch and their model, radical switch in, how they train recessions in how many sessions they train in terms of their pricing and their packaging.
And all of these things that they need to do.
0:57
And sometimes even the cost that they pay their tribute.
Wieners.
And so a lot of these changes obviously come with, you know, for the doctrine or is like this huge fear of like well, what if everything breaks, what if everything disappears and first off?
When we, when we do these massive changes most the times nothing happens and it is fear but I actually want to come at this from a different side, more from like the vibe of the business in general, like the spirit of the business and its that The reality is that the old business has to die in order for the new one to live.
1:28
And so a lot of times we don't want to confront that but we're in this vehicle, this business model that we know, Sucks, right?
Like if you're if you're if your current experience your reality has been the last three years, you know, you've let's say let's say you grew the first year and then the next two years you pretty much stayed the same amount, right?
1:50
You know that if something does not change its going to stay the same, which means, you know, that the model the vehicle that you are in is not working.
The problem is not that you don't have more customers to promise that the customers you have are getting more customers because the model you have is not providing sufficient value for them to want to bring more people in.
2:07
And so you Have more turn, then you can make up for in the front end and that's the problem, right?
The issue is that and I can't so like here's an example in this is one of the multiple stories that happened is recently.
There's this girl who perhaps our food for us, right?
So she makes all of our food like to the mackerel personalized for us and it's great saves me a ton of time and foods good.
2:31
So like and she's a she's a cool girl.
She's really young and she's like just getting her foot into the entrepreneurial door.
So I feel like I'm Half donating to the charity entrepreneur, our federalism.
But she's like, man, I'd really like to do this full time and I was like, okay well I was like tell me your business model, right?
2:47
She's sitting, you know, she's in my kitchen cooking, all the food and I was like, okay let's look at what this looks like if your week is actually full and she still wasn't making the amount of money that she wants to make it for week was full.
And so she currently had like three customers.
3:03
We were one of them and then there's two other ones that she had this like Legacy customers.
And so and one of them was asking for two days a week of prepping for the same pay as one day.
And so she's basically getting paid half on this one and then the first customer she had, was like a legacy customers first person you ever signed up and that one is paying like even less than the the split person, right?
3:22
And so I was like, you have to change your pricing so that it actually makes sense that you can make a profit right and she understood fundamentally.
And so then she goes she changes her pricing one night.
She changes from charging hourly to charging on a weekly basis puts it on recurring cells.
3:40
It is a package instead of selling her time etcetera and she emails everyone about the change which was a big No-No.
You should never do that.
You especially if you have a tiny little clientele, they should have got on the phone or spoke with them in person, but that was a mistake on her part but that's okay.
Point is after that happened.
Two of the three people left.
3:57
Okay, so we were the only ones who left.
So she's like a little nervous because I took your advice and 2/3 of my customers Left Right 2/3.
Being two out of the three she had.
And I was like right now, those people, you know, we're taking out two or three of your five days and we're not paying you in a way that would allow you to make the profit or Revenue that you need to make in order to do this full-time, right?
4:23
She's like right, I was like, Okay, you need to let the old model die for the new one to live, right?
And so this happens all the times of gyms where there's there's this this fear of like well what if and the reality is even if that happens this model can grow and scale and be profitable at full capacity, the model that you had before cannot do that.
4:48
And so, it's a Fool's errand to keep trying to play that game.
When, you know, it doesn't work.
You know, what's going to lose, right?
And so we keep telling her, like, we have this fear and it's 100% irrational because at the bottom line, we already know that doesn't work.
5:04
You already know, it doesn't work.
And yet we still don't want to lose it, but we know it doesn't work, right?
And so, like, this goes with personal Transformations decision.
Like, if you want to change a part of your, you know, like let's say, like, I don't want to start, you know, I don't want to drink anymore.
5:20
Okay.
Well, you can't just like not drink some of the time and then only Drink on weekends or only drink after 6:00 at night and whatever, right?
Like like those things like you have to let the old thing die for the new thing to live, right?
You want to go to church, you want to be a Christian, you want to my act, a certain way, whatever it is, right?
5:40
You can't just act a certain way.
Five days a week than two days week, not act.
That way.
You have to go all in on that new thing.
Hey, guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five.
5:55
Our views, it has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over 1,000 hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I guess the partner with you.
6:12
So that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
And sometimes there's a, there's a hiccup that happens when you change, but change is part of growth, right?
And so, if you're in your business, you know, you need to make a change, Don't Fear?
6:27
The short-term, step back, be hopeful for the long-term growth.
That's going to happen as a result.
And so is that like you have to let the old die for the new to live and if you know you need to change your pricing or you know, you need to change your fulfillment because you're already at full capacity but you're not making money.
6:44
That's a model problem.
Like that's my that's a problem with Pricing.
That's a problem with the Fulfillment.
Like if your trainers are making more than you are, there's a problem, right?
Like these are these are issues and if you make those changes there will be a short period of time or maybe.
Maybe if you if you if you cut your trainer pay for example and I'm I do I'm not for cutting trainer Bay but I'm saying if it has to happen, sometimes the economics of the like sometimes a yogurt store, doesn't pay the people kind of counter $25 an hour.
7:11
Why?
Because this is not in the economics of the business, right?
It's just not, right?
So if that is how you were set up, you're paying you A person behind the counter.
Who is doing, you know, who's dispensing, yogurt, $25 an hour.
I'm saying this figuratively.
If you have to change that, that means you might lose some employees and then you might have to go find some new employees.
7:31
But you know that if you don't do that, you're guaranteed to stay where you're at, right?
There's a part in The Matrix where Mio gets in the car, it's raining, they stopped under the bridge and they're like, lift up your shirt, so they can put this, you know, like suck out the bug that he had in his stomach or whatever and he's like, what's going on?
7:51
Freaking out.
And before he says, yes, they like stopping crack, open the door and she looks at me and she's like, don't go down that road.
You know, you know where it goes and you know that's not where you want to be.
And so like I feel like that's the message for like business model that you have that you know, doesn't work for you is that like you know where that road goes?
8:13
You've been walking that road for the last two years.
And I know that's not where you want to be.
And so like take the switch, take the new opportunity like shed the old identity to get into the new one, except the short-term loss, or like discomfort.
That's going to happen with changing a habit changing.
8:30
A pay structure of changing a model changing pricing.
The person is like, like, for example, that girl, the the customers who left her right arm, good riddance for her, right?
If you have people who are paying you $49 a month for large group training, right?
8:48
And then they're like, well I can't believe you'd raise this to $150 a month.
Good riddance their pain in the ass and they're not worth the revenue.
They're bringing in there, not right.
It just doesn't make sense for the model.
So you have to accept that and accept that sometimes like, I mean, this I'm not trying to give a bootie as on Sunday, but like, you have to prune the tree, right?
9:10
Like trees grow by pruning.
Which means you have to cut off old branches and cutting things is painful.
And not only that you can them into the fire afterwards like you get rid of it, you burn it, you're done with it right?
And you go all in on the new Direction you go forward.
9:25
Despite the chatter, the noise that's going to happen for all these people who want to give you business advice, who are your customers.
Right there incentivised to stay at $49 a month, it makes sense for them to argue with you.
It makes sense for them to put doubt into your mind about that decision because for them, they get less now right.
9:45
Because you made it as you made decisions in the beginning.
Without the proper information, you didn't know.
And that's okay, you didn't know.
But now you do know and so if you if you act in ignorance no one can blame, you didn't know.
But if you know and then you choose not to do what, you know you need to do.
10:02
That's fear and that is your fault.
And so that's the difference.
You have to own it, you have to own the decisions that are going to change, there's going to be discomfort and you have to let the old die in order for the new to live.
Because the new is the only thing.
To get you where you want to go.
So lots of love to let you community and if y'all aren't crushing it you should be.
10:24
If you're not with us you're totally comment and like hop on because the water is warm.
And we've got some things rolling out that that are going to continue to have all the gyms that are working with us.
Crush it with new offers that are already converting new Prophet mechanisms new acquisition systems.
10:41
All the, all the Gucci.
I'm so pumped, there's so much Much good stuff coming out but anyways, I won't ruin it.
I won't spoil it as much as I usually do.
Anyways, you guys on the flip side.
Much good stuff coming out but anyways, I won't ruin it.
I won't spoil it as much as I usually do.
Anyways, you guys on the flip side.









0:00
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
0:18
You guys are having an amazing week so far.
This is something that this concept why should do is dangerous and how to make unhealthy amounts of do of money doing Very few things.
And so I wanted to take a quick moment to talk about this concept.
0:38
Okay so here's let's let's dig in.
So one of the number one things that happens with entrepreneurs as they get going is that you have so many should do you have so many things that you have to do or that you should do?
That?
It gets suffocating.
It gets overwhelming because you're like, oh my God, there's so many holes in my business.
0:54
There's so many things that I need to do that.
I should do that.
I'm not doing good morning.
Craig morning.
Jordan and so how do you tackle that right?
And what's interesting is that the bigger you get, the more horsepower you have on your team in the more You feel like you can take on these, should dues, right?
1:10
And so let me give an example, how should this become innumerable and impossible?
So, if you were to look at the business with the five core functions, right?
You got lead gen leading Archer sales fulfillment Reese on ascension.
Right.
I could look at any business ours included and look at lead generation be like you know what?
We should be doing.
We should be doing six other platforms and we should be making ads every single day.
1:29
We should be making professional videos and all this stuff, right?
That's all these things that we should do for Legion.
I need them to get them to show up for leading Archer.
Okay, I should have an Hire 150 day, email sequence that you go out to them with content and emails and text messages, and direct mail and all of these things that would help improve my leave nurture process, which he absolutely would, right?
1:52
I should be training my sales guys to sell better, I should be listening to all of their calls and all of their recordings so that I can improve their selling ability and I should be coaching them more.
One-on-one fulfillment.
I should be doing more things to, wow, and shocking.
All my customers, I should have Talking all package.
2:09
I should be mailing this out, I should be right and so I can keep going.
And all of those things that I just named will make you more money, right.
But the question is, and the thing that plagues entrepreneurs is, which should I do?
And so, one of the things that happens is like we think of all these things and that's because rocks Burgers, we think of all these things that we should do that, we should improve because we are by our nature problem.
2:31
Solvers, we seek out problems to go try and solve them to try and fix them.
And the first place, we always look as our own businesses because we To improve those first cuz that's how we make money, right?
The thing though, and that's why I call this and how to make.
So, like, why should you is dangerous, that is, why should do is dangerous, right?
2:46
And how to make unhealthy amount of money doing very few things.
And so the, the one real role, right?
If the CEO of the entrepreneur of the, the man in charge of you guys, right is not to always think of the should do is because actually I don't think thinking of the should do is is very difficult.
3:02
You can go to an event and Come Away with 100 should choose, right?
There's a million, right?
the question is, is your ability to differentiate between the actual contributed value of those should dues to your bottom line that your skill in navigating that decision making process will determine how much money you make, and how successful your business is because no matter the size of the business, whether you have four people at your gym or you've got 85 thousand employees, You always have a limit on your human capital.
3:36
So we always have this stuff.
I just need more people.
I just need my team to be bigger.
I just need I just need X, right?
I've seen more money.
I see more, right, human capital, I need more resources, whatever, right?
The thing is, is that there will always be a deficit of what you need to accomplish, Because the actual list of things that you should do, will always surpass your resources, right?
3:56
Which is why, as long as you like things are working, well, there's always more opportunity to be seized to improve the business, right?
The thing though, is that How does one business move faster than another, right?
How does it actually happen?
4:11
Like how did we come into pretty much an established market place and then go faster than everyone else?
Right?
In 24 months actually, it's not even 24 months set, how do we do that?
If you deconstruct.
It's not by doing more for sure.
4:26
Like we you know we try and manage our time and we try to be effective, highly disciplined for sure like that goes without saying but I would reason that a lot of people try to do, right?
The thing that we've done very well in that I think we should be modeled is looking at all of the decisions, all of the should dues all of the tasks that you could potentially do and allocate Human Resources, allocate Financial Resources toward and then in the beginning you are mental resources to work.
4:55
Because if it's just you and a team of three you're going to be half the horsepower of routine, right?
And looking at which one of these things is going to make me the most money and what Happens.
If you actually look at your day in terms of activities and the things that you're doing, you probably have this huge list.
5:14
If you look at what your time is being actually spent on most of the times, we have these projects that we start doing, sometimes we start doing things to procrastinate because we don't want to do the things that we know we should do, right?
That's one that's a big one because the thing that we should do, the one thing that might be the most effective than might move the ball forward might take discomfort, might take learning a new skill that we don't know yet and we To go through that discomfort period.
5:37
So we start doing less important things, there are things that we should do, and we could definitely make the rational argument that me making 150.
Email sequence would improve the amount of people who, over time would come back into gym lunch, I can make that argument all they look, I actually got a request for that from my sales director.
5:53
And this is a few months ago, I have not done it.
And I told him I wasn't going to do.
It was a request.
He literally was like, do this, and I was like, No.
And and there is an argument for why it would make us more money.
I I just don't think it would make us more money than the other things that I'm working on.
6:11
And so that's where my attention should go.
And so, your ability to navigate all of this huge and endless to-do list and be able to actively cross things out that, you know, you should do in favor of doing the things that you need to do.
6:27
Because it's the one thing that's going to move your business forward in a massive way.
And that's why when I get on the phone with guys who are stuck at 5 million, stuck at 10 million and then like how do you do it so quickly?
And I ask them what they're doing, I asked them what their focus It's done it, like nine times out of ten, it's for lack of better term bullshit.
6:45
You know what I mean?
I look at them like this.
Like they're working on things that are not the bottleneck.
Hey, if you're a return listener and you have not rated or reviewed the show, I want you to know that you should feel absolutely terrible about yourself and everything else in the world getting.
7:02
But it would mean the absolute world to me.
If you guys would go ahead and do that, you don't have to pause the show, you keep listening and you can just do with your thumb right now.
It'll take you less than 60 seconds.
And like I said, the only way that podcast goes through word of mouth and this is you joining hands with me and helping as many entrepreneurs with possibly can because no one is coming to save us, it's just us.
7:18
All right, so please go do that now.
Then let's get back to the shop.
They are not the weak Link in the chain.
And so what's interesting is that there's, there's these like two totally different schools of thought, right?
You have your like, double down on your strengths, like, only be good at these things and then Outsource the rest, you have that sort of, you know, narrative that that gets pushed on us.
7:43
And then you have the other side, which is like, work on your weak points, right?
So you can become more balanced all the bubble bath.
The difference between working on yourself right versus working on your business, is that you yourself.
Like I shouldn't learn accounting.
7:58
That's probably not a good use of my time, but if my business has a point in time, were accounting becomes the bottleneck that I need to solve that problem.
And so that's where the balance between, what am I?
What am I, what are my strengths versus?
8:14
What is the weakness of the business in the beginning?
Your strength is, what is Is propelling the business because in the beginning, anything you do, if you're like good at sales and you start selling stuff right?
But then other parts and then because that's a strength that starts moving things forward.
But then another thing is going to hold the business back and until you can identify which of these things is the real bottleneck, and that's why it takes wisdom, it takes discernment to look at the business and be able to see.
8:40
And that's why sometimes have a consultant having people from the outside, be able to look in without emotion without investment.
Because you might have had a sunk cost of time.
I've been Beyond this email sequence for, you know, I get this one all the time.
Like, well, you know what Alex I'm going to do exactly.
You said, but I'm going to finish this thing first, because I've already put in 55 weeks.
9:01
I'm like cool you putting in another three weeks on that project, you finish it still will like make you less money than solving the one problem that if you took the next three weeks that it would take you to finish that thing.
If you took those three weeks to solve this problem, you'll still make more money.
9:18
And so, when I get on these calls and I talked to these entrepreneurs, like the only thing I'm listening for literally And like, you'd be amazed what a coaching session with Alex's.
Like it's literally just what's, what's the, what's the thing that's holding you back?
What's the weak link?
9:33
What's the bottleneck, right?
And as soon as you identify that, it gives you focused and then you can ignore everything else because when you take off the weak link, everything blows up right until the next bottleneck, right?
That's the thing.
And so, if you were to make a fitness comparison, if you're really, really strong off the floor and You can't finish your deadlift right?
9:56
You just can't lock it out.
You getting stronger and stronger off.
The floor isn't going to do anything because you're like, I have to double down on my strengths.
I have to get better at sales.
I'm already good at sales but we get even better.
Make it even better.
If your problem is that you can't retain for shit, that's not going to grow the business, it doesn't matter, right?
10:12
Because that's the weak link and so you might not be naturally an empathetic and caring person but you can find someone who is Empower them with the decisions and then and then Coach them with culture.
To take ownership over that aspect of the business and then the business itself grows because a business needs to be balanced.
10:31
The people in, it are not and so you need to double down on your strengths, your employees need to double down on their strengths.
You need a coach them to double down on their strengths so that as a whole we create a balance business even though individually we're all weird, you know, but when we put it together, It works and it is balanced.
10:52
That is how the business can grow and expand because it has greatly generation, greatly nurture, great sales, great fulfillment, great Ascension, great retention.
It has all of these things in place but it's through an unbalanced team of weirdos that it's accomplished.
And so when you look at this huge list of should dues the number one thing you need to do is not get stressed is not feelings.
11:15
ID is give yourself permission to not do three quarters of them and never look at them again.
Because the reality is that you probably have one thing or two things, that are the real things that are going to drive the business forward are going to break through the bottleneck so that you can grow your business.
11:30
The business can actually continue to grow and can leverage the strengths that you have.
So, I hope that makes sense.
I know everyone's got New Year's resolutions.
I know that everyone wants to do more.
Everyone wants to do whatever, right?
And a lot of times conventional wisdom is wrong.
A lot of times you just need to do less but do the right things and those are are the things that are going to grow your business.
11:52
Right, do less pick the things strategically.
I don't have more hours than the people who used to be my competition.
Who are now, you know, do less than a year than we do in a week.
It's not like I have more time.
It's not like I'm smarter, it's not, you know, we have equal access to information I believe.
12:11
And this is my belief and I could be wrong.
I've been corrected by someone else later knows, I don't know, but I believe the reason that we've been able to grow quickly is because in the limited amount of human resources that we Of and had in the beginning sound like we had more people than our competitors did when we had three form.
Ho he's right.
12:27
We had a limited amount of capital and we simply invested it.
We allocated it to projects that were more valuable that, that made their time, more effective when we had a higher return on our human capital on the attention that we invest.
12:44
We got a higher return on that because we didn't have a bottom line.
Every time we had a bottleneck, we were to invest I identify with that I don't like was despite having may be other issues in the business, but they weren't the one that's holding us back.
So, I hope that makes sense to everybody.
I hope you guys are having a mazing new year so far and loving life and crushing your bowls.
13:05
And so, sometimes I think it's good to remember.
Look at your big list of shouldn't dues.
Don't feel guilty about it.
If you feel anxiety, and means you need to prioritize them and get rid of most of it and be okay with the fact that your business will literally never be perfect ever.
And you literally now Never have enough people, you'll literally never have enough money.
13:23
And so the skill of the entrepreneur is in picking which one thing or two things, am I going to take my time and attention of my team and focus on?
That's all I got if you could drop a comment or like I would give you a like and a comment back to your comment.
13:39
Alright, you guys have an amazing week and I'll catch you guys on the flip side, all right.0:00
What's going on, everybody?
I'm bringing some more books, but I wanted to say that, if you haven't checked out Hunter million-dollar offers, I would definitely suggest that you start there.
I've gotten some solid feedback and it couldn't be happier with its.
Number one ranking on Amazon for direct marketing and over 5,000, five star reviews.
So, thank you guys so much for that.
0:15
It's 164 pages.
I really can help you out.
It takes about four hours to get through, check it out.
On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
The audiobook is Lowe's, they'll let me put it on for it.
So I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
So, here's the deal.
One of the things that Layla and I were talking about this morning was the concept of making it and Grant Cardone was talking about this in one of his videos I think a year ago about how they're like, we're just like, when do we really make it?
0:41
Like he was talking to Atlanta like yeah but like what are we going to really make it and so and Layla and I were thinking about this this morning because like you can still feel the pressure of like wanting to stockpile away.
More money wanting to stockpile way more and, you know, Layla was like, you know you said when we had X moaning the account, you would you Okay.
1:00
And then that tripled and then then you said that would be enough.
And now here we are and we have even more than that and you still feel like it's not enough.
And so I wanted to give you kind of a back and napkin approach of why I think like why we were confronting this or at least for me why I'm confronting this issue and why I'm realizing that it's a hopeless attempt.
1:20
And so the reason that you'll never have enough is not because of a greed.
So there's like there's I think there's a mistake in fallacy in the Is something that I believe was that, like, I believe that anybody who felt like there was never enough was greedy, right?
1:36
But the reality is that you never feel like you have enough, you always feel like your exposure was feeling, You're vulnerable, like, for me, like a very security driven.
Ironically because I'm an entrepreneur, but like I'm very risky.
I'm risk-averse when it comes to making money, but once I have money, I'm very, very sorry, I'm risk.
1:53
Prone, when making money and risk-averse, when once I have it, like I don't want to risk it once I have it, right?
And so What happens though, is that the size of the business that's necessary in order to make the amount of money that you were trying to make and stockpile away and put away with the side continues to grow?
2:10
And so, the amount of money that in our minds feels comfortable is typically, like, I mean, at least for me, the amount of money that I said, when I had my Jim's of like, what I wanted to feel really comfortable was like three times, the yearly revenue of all the facilities that I had.
2:27
Like, that's what I wanted in the bank accounts feel comfortable, right?
Right now, I got to that first number right, but the business that I had at that point in order to get me to that number was 10 times larger.
And so, then the the number of comfort for that business was again, even bigger.
2:47
And so, what ends up happening is that, although you make more money in, although you put more away, the, the, the burden, the cost, like the stress cost of what that business could do.
Because of the overhead etcetera and because you're responsible.
3:03
So many employees, so many families by extension.
Like, you have all this pressure and it just doesn't go away.
There was an interview with Bill Gates and he was with Warren Buffett.
They were both on stage.
You can like, check it out on YouTube and he was talking about how one of his big goals was to always have one year of costs for the company in savings.
3:22
Right.
Mind, you, Bill Gates to this point was the richest man in the world.
Okay.
And he's like and we in the of you whose like we just barely got there.
He's like yeah I think it's like 17 billion, right?
And so just think about it for a moment because I think in some ways it's incredibly stressful to think about the fact that you'll never be free.
3:42
But in some ways, it's freeing because then you no longer have the expectation.
And so that's kind of my goal for this is like, if I can help maybe a couple people, remove the expectation of ever feeling like you'll have enough then, at least you can identify it, and then put your attention elsewhere, rather than feeling like you're always an adequate.
3:59
Or you always feel like You need more in order to cover yourself, right?
And so, A business has a million dollars a year.
Let's say you run a 20% margin, right?
Like whatever which means that you're going to make two hundred thousand dollars a year.
But your business costs eight hundred thousand dollars a year which means it would take five years of stockpiling, right?
4:22
To be able to have enough money to cover the cost of that business, if something happened, right?
And that's kind of the irrational fear.
We have is like, let's say shit hits the fan, you know.
I don't want to fire all my employees.
Like, would I be able To float my business.
While it catches up and what we fix things, right?
4:38
That's the idea, a business that does 10 million dollars a year, and you have your 20% margin again, it's the same thing.
Maybe you make two million dollars your people, like how she make 2 million dollars a year?
I mean, we make more of that but I'm saying, like, whatever, whatever the amount is, right?
Like if you were to say someone like hey, you make two million dollars a year, you should be comfortable.
4:56
Why are you stressed about money?
It's because if the business hiccups, For even, okay?
So eight million /.
Let's do the math this is the back of napkin math, right?
8 divided by 12 okay so you're looking at six hundred and sixty-six thousand dollars a month in overhead.
5:14
Right.
And so if you feel stressed, good people like hey man, you're making two million dollars a year in your mind you're like that's only three months over it.
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
5:30
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
5:52
Like I means I got like 12, like I'm like 12 weeks and being bankrupt by like.
That's that's how we, at least.
That's how I think.
You know what I mean?
Like, I'm 12 weeks away.
I can cover us for 12 weeks if shit hits the fan, right?
And so that's why a having low margin businesses is really, really hard because you really never feel like you make it in general.
6:13
So, for anyone who's on here like always try and increase your margins, increase your prices like be mindful of the Prophet not just making money.
Like if you sell something for 1,000 1,000, Usually cost you 900, it's really stressful because if something happens you still have that 900 that weighs on, right?
6:30
And weighs on your attention, was on your mind.
And so do I have a solution for this?
Besides what I just said about trying to have his Hive, a profit margin as possible, so that you have less operational drag.
So like let's give the 10 million dollar example.
Well, let's use the million-dollar example.
6:46
If you make a million dollars a year, but you're making a 50% margin right now.
You're making half a million a year in in One year, you have enough to cover the next year, right?
You see how how that like we all we did was increase the margin by 30%.
Right now, it's deceptive by saying that we increased by 30% has really increased it by two and a half X going from 20 to 50, right?
7:06
So it's deceptive with numbers.
But if you go from a 20% margin to a 50% margin with a 20% margin, you feel like it would take you four years of saving and not spending any money, which let's be real.
Like if you're making a choice on view, probably gonna spend half of that on your life, right?
That would mean, so like if you're spending half of it on your life, let's use that example to go even further with this.
7:27
You're making a hundred thousand, it will cost you take eight years to save up eight hundred thousand dollars that would cover you just for a year.
And that's why as entrepreneurs make more money, they never feel like they've made it.
It's because you always have more like as the business grows, you always have more operational overhead that grows with you and so I guess the the ask is if you ever do see one of those entrepreneurs, just making more in your life.
7:52
In.
I can't believe it like how he stressed about money or how is she stressed about money?
They're doing so much.
It also costs them a lot more and so it's kind of like the the employee who's like, well we made a million dollars this year here like dog, like there's things called margins and like not all the revenue that comes in goes to my pocket as much as I love that.
8:12
I mean, you have your mortgage which the business page for right and so to the same extent from one entrepreneur to another, don't look at the other our Corners that you see and think, oh, they're making two million years are making ten.
Million a year, if they're making 10 million a year, it probably means that they have an operational drive, that's really high.
8:28
And like, they probably still don't feel comfortable and they probably never will.
And I think the only way that entrepreneurs end up getting out and escaping, that is actually by selling the business and having sold businesses.
I think it's the only way that you get out, but here's the hook is that the moment you stop feeling the pressure that you felt in your entire life.
8:50
You then seek it again and that's what's kind of messed up, and I was talking to a, an entrepreneur who has.
He's got a huge restaurant business that you like 100 million plus a year in restaurant stuff.
And he was like, I've noticed that a lot of entrepreneurs come from really like like, you know, messed up childhoods and wouldn't, you know, it really stressful trial?
9:09
That's because I can, I think what we do is our furnaces, we like, try and recreate the environment that we had by creating chaos in our own lives in creating the pressure and creating the stress.
Ourselves because that's actually what we were raised in.
As much as we say, we don't like it.
9:24
If you look at our Behavior, it's literally all we do.
And so sure you can't escape the pressure by eventually selling the business.
And then that's when you get your 5x, multiple 6X, you know, whatever.
And then you also do, you take away the operational drag.
9:39
So you get the big plus side, you take away the operational, drag you have your big lump sum, but then at that point, you're like, well shit.
What am I here for and then you go back and start doing it again.
So anyways.
That is my message for everyone.
You will never make it and be okay with that because it's all part of the ride.
9:56
And as a small point of salt, a small consolidation or constellation Because you never make it.
We fear the whole like what if I have to float my business for a year.
The reality is that it's very rare that you would actually ever float your business for your because you'd probably end up dramatically cutting down on things and decreasing people you know, to cover cash burn.
10:21
So as much it like I still do this this math in my head, where I'm like this is how much the business cost and like I want to have that for two years, you know, I still do that myself but I know that it's irrational because rationally if we started being casual - I'd be making really Drastic, you know, decisions and you can just look at history of businesses to see that happen.
10:40
People don't actually just like, let's keep flop.
Let's keep a full sales team that has no one to sell to like, it doesn't really make sense.
Let's keep a fool, you know, all these all, these aren't boarding, you know, people all of this customer service and we don't have customers like you wouldn't really be doing that so it is totally irrational but I'm with you.
10:56
I feel the same way.
So anyways guys lots of love hope you hope this message mean.
You feel good knowing that you'll never make it but that way you can always put your attention on other stuff.
Cough and realizing that no matter what, you're going to end up playing the game again, even if you do, end up selling your business because we're crazy.
11:12
So have an amazing day, have an amazing week.
Drop a like trouble comment and you guys are amazing.
Thank you so much for your attention this morning.









0:00
What's going on, everybody?
I'm bringing some more books, but I wanted to say that, if you haven't checked out Hunter million-dollar offers, I would definitely suggest that you start there.
I've gotten some solid feedback and it couldn't be happier with its.
Number one ranking on Amazon for direct marketing and over 5,000, five star reviews.
So, thank you guys so much for that.
0:15
It's 164 pages.
I really can help you out.
It takes about four hours to get through, check it out.
On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
The audiobook is Lowe's, they'll let me put it on for it, so I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast, everyone to the juice.
Secrets podcast, my name is Alex.
0:32
I'm going to be your host for today, and we're going to be talking about how to sell to poor people.
This is something that my good friend Russell Brunson and Mentor.
You always says, don't sell the broke people, and I agree with that.
0:50
That being said, if this dream to the gym industry, a lot of times you're going to come face-to-face with someone who suffer claims himself as broke.
So, What do you do when you encounter this Enchanted Beast?
All right, so the way that this works is, there's a couple things that our work and I just want to point this this came to be because right now we have someone who's running our program in a market that we actually already like, we ran it for them in our old model when we used to do done-for-you launches, right, send a salesperson.
1:23
Now, we turn on the advertisements and then we would sell for the gems.
We now have the transition to read.
Done with you because it allows us to serve a lot more.
Gentle lot faster and agenda making a lot more money rather than I was taking all the money.
Sony ones that is what we transition to.
But this came up because the owner question, Was like, dude, everyone's broke no one can afford this bubble bubble.
1:46
All right, and what's interesting is that we literally ran the same heads to the same audience, the same demographic.
And I had my guy there, and we generated 95,000 and sales in five weeks of new signups.
2:07
And it's just, it's fascinating because broke my instead is not only of the people, but of the person On.
And it's one of those things that's really, really hard to get out of, okay.
Now, I'm not going to be the one who's, like, let's go abundance mindset because I do believe in that, but it's not really tactical and not something that's gonna make you money right now, right?
2:25
That's something that you kind of have to find on your own.
And it's really, really life-changing, but that's not, we're going to talk about today.
So we're going to talk about how do you celebrate people.
Now, one of the number one things that you have to have conviction in your pocket, right?
Because if you don't believe that your product is going to massively helped this person and that you are genuinely the best in the market, then you should go Go and figure out a way to become the just in the market and give yourself that level of confidence when you're talking to someone.
2:50
And if you believe genuinely in your core, not what you just say, you believe, what will you actually believe that you are going to best serve them?
And then you are not taking their money that you are actually helping them better their lives and maybe even get into a position where they are more confident, and they switch from a scarcity, mindset to an abundance mindset.
3:07
That can be life changing and transforming if you don't see the value in that, then you might want to stop sending your program but hopefully, You do.
So, I'm going to assume that you do and I'm going to move on.
Okay?
One of the huge breakthroughs that I had was understanding that you can sell to anyone.
Now, like I said, this is something that Russell would probably like kick me for saying, but here's my argument, okay?
3:26
People who are middle-class, well-off have jobs, whatever those are easy to sell to because obviously they have the money and then it's, that's that's an easy sale right now.
What happens when someone says they don't have money or even more, importantly, if someone walks into your facility and you have judged them as someone who does not have money, which is on you, not them because I genuinely believe that people who are quote, poor or quote broke, Would really really benefit for my services because I think that I can help them in a huge Way by helping them control.
3:59
One aspect of their life that would lead into many, many others and I've had people who we signed up who were unemployed they put it on a credit card and then lost 30 pounds in their first six weeks or whatever it was and then found themselves.
And then got a new job that paid three times as much as their own job because of the confidence, how they looked and how they felt okay?
4:19
Because those habits and that stuff Discipline in that willpower that confidence trickled into the rest of my life and I believe that true and I hope you do too.
And I think that's why a lot of us got into the fitness industry in general.
Okay.
But in that moment, how do you sell more people?
And now this is my and this is my little hack, okay?
4:35
And this is a belief, this is something that you can put in your mind that will help you get over this one.
I believe everyone deserves the opportunity to buy my services.
Okay, here's a little story about that for friend of a friend's used to sell home smoke alarms.
Okay.
4:51
Door-to-door.
Or and he went in it was invited in and he was talking to the wife of the household and they were talking about smoke alarms.
But as soon as you came in a team really I mean they invited event.
It seemed really evident that you know that they weren't well off at least by the surroundings that he saw in the house.
5:09
And he's talking to husband and he said, all right, well, you know, I wish you guys a great day and and then you try to go on his way and as she's walking out the door and walking down the street on the sidewalk, the husband comes outside.
And It's chasing me and yelling at him and said, like what you don't think that I'm good enough, you don't think I'm rich enough to deserve to protect my family.
5:28
Like what a smoke alarm.
Like you think I'm that poor that I can't afford that right?
Like how dare you.
Okay.
And it was because that salesman had been to judgment on the individual and not even pitch them.
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
5:45
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
6:07
So, how many times have you and your like, when you've been selling?
Someone giving them a half-hearted pitch because you felt like they were going to say no.
Well, obviously they're going to say no because of what you, because you based like you, there's ways of asking questions where you already tell them, what answer you want, right?
You can say with your tone, your body language, Etc, where you're like, well, you want to sign up.
6:25
That's basically said, please don't please don't sign up.
I'm not expecting you to sign up.
I'm giving you an easy out, right?
Versus like, ready to take a lot spot and do this, like, all of a sudden they're like, oh wow, he's really asking you really think set and A lot of times, we self-sabotage our own sales because we believe that that person is poor or broke, not because of anything that they said, but because about own judgments because of our own mindset that has nothing to do with them.
6:47
All right, so the main one, how do you get around them?
So for me, one first belief is that everyone deserves the opportunity to buy my products and services incorporate that into your brain.
Okay?
Everyone deserves an equal chance, everyone deserves an equal pitch, everyone deserves an equal amount of enthusiasm in that pitch so that they have the opportunity to say yes and change their life.
7:09
Okay.
Maybe I'll bet you that Georgia door salesman If he if that house had burned down in some and God forbid something bad happens he would have felt horrible about not selling.
His ass off in that self.
Okay, you have to believe in your product and that's something that saves lives, right?
7:26
And he didn't do it, because he felt they were too poor because he lost sight of what he was trying to do just save lives.
Okay?
So that's Story.
Number one to reinforce belief, number one, which is everyone deserves the opportunity to buy equal opportunity?
I'm an equal-opportunity seller.
Okay, the second one and I think this one's even more profound is that and this is kind of like a mindset half.
7:47
But rich people, middle-class people with Abs everyone say can afford my product and service.
Right now, quote for people, quote broke people, the reason that I believe that those people are poor or are broke if they are indeed for broke not just off of a judgment is that they are very poor.
8:07
They don't know how to manage their money, they're not very good at right?
And usually, it's that people who just kind of blow money don't have discipline in that aspect of their life.
And so if you think about it, if that person is not Disciplined in their spending right, then it should be easier.
8:26
To acquire their dollars, not hard easier, right?
Think about if they are poor because they spend all their money.
They spend all their last dollars.
Then there is no reason that they should not spend their last dollar with you.
And I believe that because I believe that you can fix them when I can't fix them your savior, but you can lead them to a place of abundance to a place where they can transform their lives through your program.
8:49
Etc.
Okay.
And so to wrap this up so I try and keep these short.
The two main beliefs that you need to break.
Or one that you don't sell to everyone equally, you need to sell, you need to be an equal opportunity salesman.
You need to sell that every single person as a you mean it.
9:06
And so you really want to have them, okay?
And you really really want to help them because if that person who walked in, who was quote pouring your mindset, you do not try to sell them as a heart attack next week.
Who's that on?
Well hopefully they don't do it at your gym.
Anyways, forget that but I'm saying here, right?
9:22
You would never want something like that.
Bad to happen to them because they did not.
Take the opportunity by your service because you didn't sell hard enough.
Second one is that quote broke people or people are broke because they do not manage their money and they spend it and they blow it and they don't, they're not disciplined.
So you should have an advantage, not a disadvantage in the sale because that person is more likely to give you their money.
9:45
So take those home, consider them to on them and then the next time you have a sales consultation and that person walks in the door and you're like, oh man, they don't look like to have anything, do not judge them.
Them give them an equal opportunity to buy your product and understand that you may even have an advantage in the conversation because they're more likely to buy cuz they don't have the skill set to say no.
10:08
All right, so I know this is a little bit raw.
I just want to be like truthful with you.
This is, these are the things that I've told myself.
That help me sell, and I hope they're useful for you if you'd like to see how we get, Jim's from zero to full capacity in 30 days, I would like you to opt into our beautiful.
10:26
Case study little thing.
It's a gym launch secrets.com forward slash quiz and on the thank you page.
You want the opportunity to hop on the phone with us.
We do not take money on the first phone calls, so, leave your credit cards at home.
We just want to chat and see if our system would work for you.
10:43
All right, have an amazing, amazing day and I will catch you guys on the flip side.









0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else, it is early. and Layla is like, you know, you haven't made any contact Layla wants to make.
This is on my mind and dingy the man.
The myth.
0:40
The legend King has asked me to make this.
So Danny this one is for you, so it's too good to be true, right?
And how to deal with the beliefs that literally ruin your life?
And so I wanted to make this because beliefs about things like it's too good to be true, literally do ruin your life.
1:00
And so one of the The things that end this, this obviously come up, so Danny works for us.
He's one of our sales guys and but this is something that comes up.
Also, in a weight-loss sale.
Where someone's like, I don't believe that I can achieve that result.
I don't believe that XYZ, right?
1:16
Like I don't think I'll ever get back to my high school.
Wait, I don't, well, you know, whatever it is right.
And usually, it's a balk at the price, right?
And so the first, the first, like confrontation there is like, what would it look like if you were to imagine a program that was going to get you there?
1:31
Like what would involve L've right?
And and then usually the prospect will come back to you.
It's like like, I don't know, I mean like and usually because they don't know, right?
It's like what do you think they'd have like, you know, customer support that answers within three minutes?
Do you think you'd have a personal coach to walk you through everything?
1:47
Do you think you'd have a strategic coach that you can hop onto every single day?
Do you think that you'd have 500 other people who you're an exact same type of business in your style of market and went from where you are to where you want to be?
We've all done it within the last 12 months, to make sure that it's relevant.
Do you think that would be something that would be?
2:02
There will ya.
It's like, okay, so and so you're using this in the weight loss L just like you use it in a B2B say everything's the same, right answer?
You're like what and it like, in art sales training, we call this the Unicorn close.
It's like what kind of unicorn program are you looking for, right?
Because like all of these things that you think would be required in order to get there are here, right?
2:22
So what else is missing right?
And the reality is that there isn't anything missing.
What's missing is the belief that it's possible, right?
It's the conviction that it can actually happen and that happens for two reasons.
One, One is because I got burned in the past.
I wanted to believe something.
I did say yes, I did something like this and then it didn't happen, right?
2:40
And so the mental overcome for that is don't let something bad.
Burn you twice, right?
If I went to middle school, I asked a girl to dance.
And then she said, no, right?
Do I now automatically assume that I should never go after girls ever again?
I can never be married.
Of course not, right?
2:56
Because you wouldn't let that one mistake burn.
You more than once because if it did, then that one mistake will continue to haunt you forever.
Right?
We make mistakes or people make false promises it happens, right?
But if you then cling to that and say forever, I will never let someone help me it's dumb, right?
3:13
Because the best way to get to where you want to go, is to learn from who've done it, ask any billionaire has any.
I mean you might not ask it later but like if you if you observe the energy watch their interviews.
The first thing that I always say is I didn't get here alone, right?
I tons of help.
I have tons of mentors.
I have tons of because, like, I tons of coaches who helped me through these different areas.
3:32
He's blocking points because they had already done it right to try and figure it all out on your own.
It's literally impossible.
All we use human beings to stand on each other's backs and continue to move forward.
So to believe that you can do it on your own is unreasonable and prideful.
Okay, that's just to cover that one scenario.
3:48
The other scenario is that you truly.
Don't believe it's possible.
Now that's from the limiting standpoint, which is this is like one of the most paralyzing and things that makes you unhappy in life, right?
Is your like, I want this huge change.
4:05
I want this huge outcome, right?
And yeah, I don't believe it's possible.
It's literally cockpits cognitive dissonance.
It's two equally powerful thoughts that, that sit there and that's why I Prosper can't make a decision because they have both and they believe both, but on some level you can't believe both.
4:23
So you have to pick which one you want to believe.
Do I believe that?
I really like I really want to achieve this.
I think it's impossible.
Then stop wanting to achieve that.
You don't need me or believe that it's possible.
You have to part ways with one of them, right?
4:40
And then, the next thing that happens is like, at what point does it become unreasonable to not believe?
At what point does it become unreasonable more?
Reasonable to believe, than not to believe, right?
Like some people like, a lot of people believe in laws of gravity, right?
5:00
Like, you can't see it, but at What point after demonstrating enough times does it become believe?
What it would be unreasonable to not believe in gravity, right?
So at what point at what amount of data?
Is it unreasonable?
And so like if it's a weight loss program you can ask that question at what point, how many testimonials do I need to show you for you to believe that it's reasonable and if you still don't believe, then at what point are you being unreasonable?
5:29
And then what what arbitrary bar have you set?
That is unattainable that you would say yes to write.
Like, you're saying, like, well, you know, if somebody who had my exact DNA, I had gone through this program at the same time, literally just six weeks ago, then I would believe it's like, well, do you believe that that is reasonable and do you believe that having that standard is actually going to help you get to where you want to go, right to the gym owner who wouldn't believe?
5:58
Like, I mean, I don't even know what would like yours, 800.
Testimonials last 12 months, like, I don't know.
Like, here's here's 20 people.
You can talk to her doing it right now, still.
Like, I don't know.
It's like, you know, like in markets just like, you were to round models just like yours.
Went from where exactly where you are to where you want to go.
6:15
I don't know.
At what point is it being a reasonable?
That's up to you.
You don't know me.
And so one of the other things is that I like using one of these likes, like a weight loss situation is like we're like, it's just, it's just a belief situation, right?
Is like if this were true, what else would be true?
6:33
Right.
So, like, okay, you're not sure if so like if gravity exists, if I drop this thing, it should fall at the same rate as if Shut up this, right?
My gun both should happen, right?
Okay.
So if Jim launch, right really, did acts really did help all of these gyms right in this short amount of time.
6:55
What else would be true?
Well, we probably go from.
I don't know 20 employees last year to 90 in 12 months.
That might be something that would also be true.
Did it happen?
Yes.
Okay.
Do we go from like 5 million in sales?
7:12
250 million dollar run rate in 12 months.
Yes, huh.
Okay.
So that happened to like you don't say like it.
Like what else would happen?
Well we have a largest community of Jim's that's out there that pays more than anyone else.
7:28
Y-you don't mean like what else would need to be true in order for the postulate in order for the first statement to be true?
Same thing with you at the gym.
If you're like okay you're asking the prospect what else would need to be true for you to believe like we do?
All of these testimonials.
7:44
Okay, sure.
Forget those because that's not reasonable fine.
No big deal like what else would need to be true?
Oh, all of these five star reviews on Yelp, cool.
Okay.
Maybe those aren't true, all of these five star reviews on Google.
Those are probably fake to all these five star reviews on Facebook.
8:00
Cool.
And your interpersonal Judgment of who I am as a person, right, you do need to trust your intuition a certain point, like if there were a person Who went through the trouble of trying to like, think about this for, like, just for a moment.
Like, let's just use our example because it's the internet and it's like more crazy.
8:19
If there were a business owner, that somehow paid all of these actors right to get on the phone with people, that's one to all of the people that somehow anonymously, comment on all all the stuff and all the groups.
Okay.
8:35
All of these people are are fake accounts.
Sure that's a lot of effort.
Okay.
Next all of the videos of all of these people.
Again, paid actors all of these huge event venues which mind you even renting an event venue that big cock.
It's half a million dollars, like no big deal but like it's like now we're starting in a real money, then real money and amount of effort to to make something that is fik-shun, like if that's really where you're coming from.
9:02
And also comes from like a ridiculous amount of scarcity and like, fear, like what you need to confront on your own time, if that's actually where you're operating from, that being said, if that's if that's your belief set at some level, I'd be like, I almost want to work with these people because they went through that much effort, you like It would be so ridiculous that like the amount of work ethic that would be necessary to pull off a sham.
9:25
Like that would almost be the equivalent amount of skill that are required to make a 50 million dollar business in 24 months.
And That skill would be translated into the products that we sell on how to scale a business.
9:43
So how can we, how can we, how could how to make the argument?
We can't scale a gym, right?
If we can sell something that's bigger and more complex at a faster rate like like it has to like if this is true, what else also must be true.
10:00
And if all of those other things are also true that must be true for the primary Ain't that it would be unreasonable through not to believe, right?
And so, one of the things that and I'm a boss, but I'm getting, I'm getting winded.
10:20
So, here's the damaging admission.
So, if I wanted to gain your trust, right, what I would do is a lot of people like questions.
Like, would you prefer if we had worse results?
Would you prefer?
Would it make you more comfortable if we had fewer?
Testimonials Well, well, of course, that's unreasonable.
10:36
So, like, but but like, if you have to ask the question, it's like, it's really like, it's just the belief of is it possible?
And if it is possible like the person's, like, I don't think I can do that.
Okay, well, then that's it.
You believe that I can try and help you break, but it has nothing to do with the business and you're just projecting them, right?
10:56
But if you needed Imaging admission, read any anything and this would be from the gyms to like if you're if you're talking to a weight loss, Like there is no one in this gym, right now who has lost 100 pounds, who lost 60 pounds, who will tell you that it will happen overnight.
11:11
There is no one that will tell you, that was easy.
There's no one that would tell you, that it was not emotionally difficult to go through this and the amount of growth that they hadn't have through that period of time, was not taxing, right?
Read any of the testimonials.
We have free daily assessment as we have for the wafer.
We lost customers is safe.
11:28
Let's see if stuff no one says, wow, this is really easy, right?
Of course, not they say this is more work than I've ever done in my life.
My life, right?
But it worked the way it said it was going to write.
Like if you drink from a fire hose, everyone wants like everyone wants to lose weight until they actually have to do the things that make them lose weight.
11:51
And so they have to give up the foods that they like, until they have to be sore the next day, until they have to come into the gym when they're still sore and go until the time that they have to wake up early 6 days in a row until the time.
Like, there's all of these things that they that come along with the thing that they wanted, right?
12:07
And so the Energy commission that I have for you is that like if you were I want you to change my gym.
Cool.
There's going to be a million hard conversations that you're going to need to have in order to get there.
What you're going to have to, you're gonna have to break your own employees lives, because believe it or not.
If you have these limiting beliefs, you hired other people who probably have them to, right, which means is we can successfully helped you break your bleep, and there's a million Jews who we help.
12:30
We hope we can break the gym, owners belief.
They come to our Summit.
They see all these Gypsy announced, he's hitting a million-dollar Runners, right?
Like, Ironically I'm going to be speaking at an event in a little bit in a few months and one of the people can be getting on stage has a gym owner who like their their their their claim is that they have a gym that the 6mm dozen you and they're going to be on stage and mind you.
12:56
They came through a burner Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
13:13
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, I didn't let them in the legs.
They requested it twice and I said, no, I wasn't a good fit.
That is average for legacy.
13:30
We've got 500 gems of a that, you know what I mean?
And so, but like when you get into a room full of people who are doing that and you're like, they're not your friend, I am, they just executed these things, then you all a sudden, boom, leave, it's true for you, right?
But what happens now, is all the conversations that have to have an after that point where the hardship, right?
13:49
That's the hard stuff.
You go there and then you're like trainers, like team.
We're going to do it and they're like, no one's.
No One's Gonna pay that price.
Ice.
No one's going to.
Let us drop our membership from unlimited to three days a week.
No one is going to like, everyone's going to revolt if we take away barbells blah blah.
14:07
But like limiting believe, limiting belief, like, let me tell you why.
It can't work cool that you might not be the ones to help me get there but I believe that I can go there, right?
And so like the biggest value that we really provide being super like transparent with everyone here is that we can help you believe because of the amount of people who have already.
14:28
Cheve, you desire, right?
And when you see that happen and you have it happen again.
And again, and again, and again, to the point of nausea at some point, something breaks the sun.
It's the thing that said I can't do this and you're like, holy shit.
What if it actually is real?
14:44
What if this could actually be true?
And then at that point your mind starts racing because you're like, holy shit?
This could be it, this could be what I was looking for and news flash.
What would the thing that You are looking for, actually look like if it did what you want it to do, if you wanted something to transform your gym and it really did transform Jim's, what would it look like?
15:10
It would probably have an insanely fast growth rate.
If it did what it said these people do, right?
Like if you were, if you were talking to me quote Guru, right what right?
And they said this thing's going to turn your gym around, it's going to double your profit, right?
15:25
If it did that.
Then why wouldn't their business be growing faster?
I see people who have been in this, but we believe in the speech for 22 months, you know.
Like literally nothing, right.
I've seen people in the space of been here for 10 years, their business is the exact same size.
15:43
How how can you be a master of scaling things?
And your business is the same size.
If it did.
What you said it was going to do, then why isn't everyone telling everyone about it, right?
If this is true?
What else has to be true?
15:59
And you can use that reasoning to make logical decisions when you're confronted with things that you don't understand or know or have enough data about and that's not a matter of stupidity.
It's a matter of ignorance.
If you don't have data, if I give if I go to the African jungle and it give it an orange and eat it like an apple, it's not because he's done this because he doesn't know, right.
16:16
And so you don't know.
So what else has to be true in order to make a decision?
That makes sense, right?
And so, if what I'm saying is true, What else needs to be true?
We have the fastest growing company.
Yes, we have Revenue levels.
Where they are?
Yes, what evolved happened almost overnight.
16:34
Yes.
If the person says that they can scale and then they're actually scaling that's probably something else.
If you connect with all these other gyms and they almost seem impetuous that your questions like you really don't believe you.
Seriously, you've been in this group for nine months, you've been in this group for nine months like holy cow and so what happens is, there's actually a bell curve and this is for everyone.
16:56
You're curious about like how like like product distribution actually works is we have your Earth your innovators to first two percent, right?
And then you have your early adopters, which is the next 3 to 15 percent and then there's this big Chasm, right?
This big gap that goes from the early majority.
17:13
So early adopters early majority I, which is the big, the first big chunk in this bell curve, right?
It's 35 percent.
So it's to two times more than two times, as big is the first two segments of the market.
The thing is that Those people tend to have more limiting beliefs and that's okay because most people have living rooms but the reason they have those right is because the the amount of effort they're willing to expend is lower.
17:38
They want to see ten other penguins jump in the water before they're like I'm going to jump in the water.
The innovators the first two percent want to be first in line they wait six hours in line to get a 40,000 dollar flat screen right.
When six months later it's going to be a quarter of the price and they can go in without waiting in line.
17:55
But that type of Person tends to be the more entrepreneurial like the, the highest are like Arturo.
People tend to just they want the edge, right?
They want like if there's something, I want it, right?
They want the Competitive Edge because we fear, that's when troopers on the marketplace.
The rest of the market needs to see more people.
18:12
The early adopters just want to see the first one to jump in like nothing blew up.
Nothing, exploded.
Cool, madhu, right.
There.
Like right there.
And right now, we as business are crossing our own Chasm into the early majority.
And so it's fun for us because Actually learning very different type of buyer Behavior, right?
18:29
We just cool is this but it's funny because like those types of buyers tend to be less emotional about the purchase which is fine.
And so when presented with data can make sound logical decisions which which is why we don't have a rush sales process, which is why we don't try and pressure close people in the first call because, like, it is a big deal, you know, means a huge investment.
18:50
So anyways, I say all this to say, if you're on the fence about weight loss, what would it look like if you did, what I am saying it does, right?
Wouldn't have a meal plan grocery list through preparation instructions, eating out, guide recipe book online portal, a coach default with your word, a coach with you in the gym, like what would it look like for you to actually transform your body like?
19:12
And if it's not this program, What's missing?
The reality.
Is that no one can answer that question because there isn't anything missing, because all the programs that like that, everyone's laying out here, like has every component of what someone needs, right?
Right.
19:28
And so, did the same degree.
Like we've tried to do the same thing with Jim launch, which is what would it look like if it actually did, what you think it should do, right?
It would probably have customer service that's available.
All the time.
Write the response within three minutes.
I remember a guru is almost you guys want me to his message me.
19:47
Like how do you get these people to stop thinking that you're going to work like respond to their emails within an hour?
And I was like--.
We do it in less than three minutes and he was like What was like?
Yeah.
It's like have a great day.
He was like totally like mind blown, right?
20:04
But like what would it look like?
So any who's dudes?
And if you need another damage, a commission, if you were on the fence about anything, here's a good one for you to chew on.
Not everyone, who does too much is successful.
Okay, there you go.
20:20
What we have is we have a category that we call Legacy eligible, which means that if there is somebody like to be like to see eligible, you need to have made more money than it cost you to do Jim large.
So if someone makes 16 thousand dollars over the time duration that they're in launch, we do not consider them Legacy eligible because it means if you could not if you could not execute with what little was given, how can I trust you to execute when I give you right?
20:47
And so it's not best serving them and it's not going to serve us and that's why I like Z has the reputation.
It does which is why when people get in there within months, their gyms double, the nutrition Cuts, all these things, because there's more things to do than just solve it.
Mission.
Right.
Sobbing acquisition, simply expose the rest of the problems in your business, but if I have someone who has limited conviction, right?
21:06
And doesn't go and then how would I expect them to do the going all in with things that are potentially less set?
Like establishing a Cadence of communication with all of your team hugely important.
Not at all sexy, right?
Thank you.
How can I have if I like make sure that they put themselves on payroll and bunch of things accordingly?
21:23
Is that sexy not at all.
Is it important hell?
Yeah, right.
But How do I make sure that they're going to reach out to all the customers within a 14-day cycle?
Right?
How do I know that they're going to reach out to our customers by Wednesday?
They haven't shown up them, right?
That's not sexy, but doubling lifetime, value is troubling, lifetime value is right.
21:42
But one of the things that actually take to make money aren't sexy.
They're boring, right?
But boring, but Rich boring, but consistent, right?
So, anyways, if you're facing someone in there, the prospects use like I just don't believe I can hit the goal, I don't believe I can achieve what you're saying.
I can achieve then just run them through like Why do you believe that is it?
22:00
Because you had a past familiar, wears it because you literally never believe that you could do it.
Both of those things this will burn you twice.
You don't let the mistake from you twice and this one will literally never serve you.
Because if you want this thing then how can you also believe that you cannot achieve it, right?
And then cool, we can put those aside.
22:17
What things would you need to see in order for it to be true?
How many testimonies would you need to see for this to be for the tube for you to believe and if you still don't believe that.
At what point are you being more unreasonable that?
I like at what point is your disbelief unreasonable and then push that aside and like well then let's just walk in this black magical, fairy ground for a moment.
22:40
If This Were true, if I said I could transform your life and that six months from now you'll be in a bikini right and you've never been in a bikini land, for whatever it is right.
What else about this program that I'm telling you would also have to be true?
Well, if that was actually that they need probably have to have all these testimonials.
23:01
Well, I mean it's not just a workout, right?
It's the food.
Well, but I do know how to cook the food.
Well, how do you make it taste good?
But what if I go on vacation?
Right.
And then they start running out you like right?
23:18
So what else would need to be true for this to be true for you?
And then at what point is you're not believing more unreasonable than believing.
And once you reach that point you realize it's like you just need to choose to believe because this is a little bit pulling from those of you who go to church.
23:35
But if you listen to any pastors talk about marriage, they will say, love is a action, right?
It's not a feeling, it's an action.
You choose to love someone, you love on your wife, right?
You love on your husband, right?
Faith is a Action, right?
23:53
You choose to have faith.
You walk in faith.
You choose to believe and you walk in them, right?
And so one of the things that actually think that people who have faith have anacs-- have an advantage over people who don't and this is no offense to anyone.
Is that those people believe that big things can happen.
24:11
They believe in a big God and so what happens is believing in a big God, frees you from a lot of limiting beliefs inherently because you believe in something much bigger.
All right, and you believe that that person can move pyramids, you believe that that person can walk on water.
You believe that that person come back from the dead.
24:27
And so it's like if that God that I saw that I believe in brought someone back from the dead.
Why can't my business double?
Why can't my business quadruple?
Why can't I massively transform an industry?
Why can't I massively?
Transform my community.
So anyhow they're going to get on.
24:43
Like the point is that belief in and of itself is a competitive Advantage if you can choose to believe.
That anything really will be open for you, but most people just don't believe and that's their problem.
And they believe that belief is an after effect and not an action.
25:00
So anyways, thanks for tuning in, but I hope you enjoyed it and nothing's ever too good to be true.
Actually, tons of things are too good to be true, but if the other things that should be there are there then you need to confront that.
It might just be you, those limiting yourself.
25:17
So lots of love an amazing day and I'll talk to you guys soon.









0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
This one I kind of came to me and I was feeling it and it's It's really, really interesting and I really want to share this with you because I think this is actually like a really powerful moment.
0:36
So hopefully allow this me to share this with you.
How to be an unconditional human it be, someone whom others count on and you know I wanted to start with a passage that I read where this is Ben Horowitz who's CEO of a company that they sold for like 1.6 billion and he has like an amazing story.
0:57
He said there's two types of friends in this world.
You have the types of friends that you call, when you have good news who are amazing and celebrate with you.
And then you have the types of friends who you call when you have bad, right?
And ideally, you want like most times, like either one of those things are an amazingly valuable, like a lot of people, like I don't have many people that I would call for good news, because there's not a lot of people.
1:18
I know, that would really genuinely celebrate with me that would genuinely want me to succeed.
It's like, that is rare in itself, but if you find someone who has both, that is someone who becomes a Mainstay in her life, and what made me start thinking about this was that I had.
1:35
So, my father called me, we had a conversation earlier this morning and I love my dad but he said, you know, I'm really proud of you, right?
You know what you've accomplished and what was interesting for me was that I didn't actually feel any emotional response from that.
1:51
And so I started thinking about it.
And I was thinking more, I was like why why do I have no emotional response to my dad saying that he's proud of me?
And for those you don't know, like my dad wasn't a huge supporter of me making the initial changes in stirring, the gym, and doing all that stuff because it made sense for him not to be because I was throwing away a life that was otherwise considered successful.
2:12
And so I think ultimately what it comes down to is Like my mom on the other hand was supportive eventually like much sooner and I still, I feel very good about that.
And I think the key piece to this is believing before you can see and so in John, 20, 29.
2:32
And like, you don't need to be a Christian is to just take, take the message from this, is that.
So Jesus in this part of it, in the Bible is Kiki, just come back from the dead and you know, some people had heard rumors about it and, you know, Thomas the data he's like I don't I don't believe that no matter what, like no one comes back from the dead.
It's anyways, he's there and he you know, business fix the holes.
2:51
It's like, oh my God, I can't believe that you and he says instance, use response to him and says, you know, you believe because you can see but blessed are those who believe who have not seen and yet some believe, and I think there's a ton of power in that that's taken outside of like, that's, that's outside of just the whole Faith component.
3:08
But having the belief in something before, you can see it within the context of human relationship, I think is one of the most powerful things you can give to someone because ultimately Ali.
When when, if someone comes up to me now, who knew me?
You know what I mean?
And did not believe and then says, I'm really proud of you.
3:26
It doesn't have any power because will sure you're proud of us now because, well, here we are like it would make sense for you to be proud of us now.
And so that would be a conditional reaction, right?
That's a conditional reaction based on circumstance, right?
3:42
The power in the significance of a relationship like that really moves you in that, Ties.
You and this is what I'm like, hoping maybe some person are does this for someone else is that?
If you can believe in someone without condition without circumstance before it happens.
3:58
That's like those of you who are parents, like, that's the time is when there is no fruit yet, you're planting the seeds, you're watering.
But there's nothing there to be proud of yet and yet you still are proud.
Hey guys real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
4:18
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com, forward slash leads it, so free in exchange for your email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller leads and so that you can not miss out.
4:41
Out on it because last time I sold out for like eight straight weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
Right?
And so it's the concept of unconditional love unconditional respect when that's not talked about nearly news as frequently or unconditional Pride from like a parent to a child deferment egotistical stamp of like being proud of someone for who they are and not for what they have done, right?
5:08
And that's the difference, because one of them is based on Circumstance, the other one is based on character, especially who they are because of who you are, I am proud of who you are.
I love you because you are My husband wife, I will respect you because you are my husband wife, not because of what you have done but because of who I am and who I choose to be and I'm going to respect you despite that like, there's another verse that's kind of related to this.
5:31
Verse says, we're just talk about being kind of people.
The intention of this morning was not to be biblical like I'm just like it's been on my mind.
So he says, like, even Tax Collectors are nice to their friends and so like again, it's circumstantial.
So like, if you have people who are nice to you, of course, you're nice back to them.
5:49
The difficulty is being nice to people who are not nice to you, right?
The difficulty isn't believing in someone who most people would not believe it.
It's in loving someone who is acting unlovable.
It's giving respect to someone who is not respect a bowl or acting in a way that is respectable.
6:05
And so like I think that one of the most powerful things that you can do as a human being is to believe before you can see.
And what happens is when you believe before, you can see the things that you believe come to fruition.
And so You have employees that you want to see like radically transform right?
6:25
Then you need to believe before you can see the result because if you are encouraging them in a like if you are if you are only doing it based on circumstance, in the beginning, then like duh, like it's great to say like hey you're a great sales guy.
6:41
After doing great sales but it's believing in them before it happens and that's where the power is and that's why it's significant for Or someone to like receipt.
Like, for me, it means more to me or my mom says, like I'm proud to you proud of you now because she was proud of me before it happened, right?
7:00
Because she was like, I'm proud of my son for who he is, for the effort that he's putting forward.
Not because of what had happened because of who I am and who she chooses to be right in contrary to that.
And I'm not, I'm not hating on my dad, like, like I love my dad, but It made sense for him.
7:19
That's the thing is it is logical to not do that.
It is logical to not believe in someone or just how someone like.
I don't think this is a good idea.
I think you were throwing something away.
Bob like it makes sense to do that but it is not the thing that makes that drives a deep emotional time or Bond or allow someone to reach a new level of achievement transformation.
7:41
Whatever.
So that was on my mind this morning and I hope you don't mind that.
I shared it with you.
That you are all the type of friend that people want to call when they have good news because you can actually genuinely celebrate with them because you genuinely want them to succeed.
And you don't start comparing yourself to them or, or being envious.
8:00
And on the flip side, you're the type of person that people can call when they have bad news, because they know that you're not going to say I told you.
So I told you that was a bad idea, but instead just be there to help.
And so I think all of that comes down to have being an unconditional human, and not basing the actions.
8:17
As of how you are talking to your employees, talking to your spouse, talking to your parents, talking kids, based on the circumstance.
But based on the predetermined relationship that you already have and who you choose to be.
So, little bit pie in the sky today, but that was something that was just on my mind.
8:33
Cuz I got off the phone and I was like, you know what, I think there's something to that that might be worth unraveling.
So that's love.
Could you guys soon?
As of how you are talking to your employees, talking to your spouse, talking to your parents, talking kids, based on the circumstance.
But based on the predetermined relationship that you already have and who you choose to be.
So, little bit pie in the sky today, but that was something that was just on my mind.
Cuz I got off the phone and I was like, you know what, I think there's something to that that might be worth unraveling.
So that's love.
Could you guys soon?

Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show is going on Happy Tuesday and I was just writing a piece of copy for an ad and I thought that those of you who have teams It's because it's simplified the concept of selling or persuasion into two pieces.
0:33
And this is something that I fundamentally believe in from a from selling standpoint.
And it allows you to simplify what your team needs to know to close a sale.
Right?
And so, instead of thinking, because we have the closer, you know, formula clarify, whether they're labeled them with the problem, overcome past pain, you know, sell them, the vacation explain away their concerns then reinforce the decision, right?
0:56
So that's the that's the closer formula as we know it.
It's up here.
But to simplify it even further for your team's, I think you can.
You can simplify it even more into two basic concepts, all right?
In the first, the first piece is the promise and the second piece is the delivery, okay?
1:16
For someone to buy what you're selling, they have to perceive the promise as valuable and perceive the promise as valuable enough in exchange for the money, right?
And so, What's interesting is that I've been able to see this from a B2B standpoint and from a b2c standpoint.
1:34
And so from a B2B standpoint it's really easy to establish a promise of perceived value because like you literally can just say like you pay us ten Grand.
We make you a hundred.
Does that sound worth it?
Everyone says sure.
Yes, of course you can do that because it's the second piece of the persuasive equation which is the one that's faulty in a B2B situation which is whether someone believes that you can actually deliver on that promise.
1:57
Right now, when you're selling, See situation, which is what we're doing at the gyms, right?
We're selling Fitness or selling weight loss.
That's where the first part, which is the promise is some one of the harder Parts sometimes to establish value because someone like that's why we have to continue to dig into the pain and then get them to realize how long they've been doing this.
2:18
Get them to realize how many pieces parts of their life.
This is affecting so that we can increase their attention on it.
And then by putting more attention on it, it increases in importance.
So they've done studies in polling when they when they talk about, like what are the most important topics for the election, right?
2:37
And so, whatever the new cycle is currently on like the for last election cycle, the wall and immigration was, you know, Trump's main thing.
And so, it was one of the primary things that people were voting on, but he created that topic right by putting people's attention on it.
And then when you put people's attention on, it it becomes more important.
2:54
And that's essentially what we're doing in southern process, is putting your prospects attention on the problem, so they become more.
Aware of how important it really should be to them.
We're in fact, most times they're using a coping mechanism of ignoring it because it's too painful to confront the emotions.
3:10
They have around how they look and how they feel, and how they're showing them as a parent Etc, right?
And so, if you are selling and someone says no, you can basically narrow it down to one of two things.
You either don't perceive what I'm saying is valuable, or you don't believe that I can get you there.
3:29
Right?
Because I mean in scenario one they say no I totally totally need to transfer my life.
I totally need to transform my body.
Like I need this.
I need this.
I need this.
But I don't think me buying ebook from you is going to get me there, right?
And then it is your job as a Salesman to, to bridge that Gap, into making them believe that.
3:48
Once they have this XYZ program they're going to get there, right?
And so what's interesting, is that with a b2c sale?
Most of the times the conviction is not as hard to get as a Nobita B2B sale like in what we do but it's still it's like medium hard but the The value side, the first promise is one of the harder ones which is why the more you dig in to why they showed in today.
4:14
The more you establish the Gap when they walk in the door.
Why are you here?
Why did you go through the trouble of signing up?
Why don't you go through the trouble of putting it in your calendar?
Why did you remember why did you get in your car?
Why did you drive through traffic?
Why did you find parking all the way to get here?
Why?
4:29
Because it's important to you you might not even realize how important is to but on some level you know that it's something that you want to change, right?
Right.
So what we're doing is we're continuing to stack value now.
When you are stacking value, one of the key pieces to understand is how much would someone pay for one more year of life?
4:49
A lot.
How much would someone pay for their children to have one more year of Life, probably even more.
How much would someone pay for their children?
Did not have to suffer all of the pain and insecurity of being overweight because they don't have the right habits, a lot a lot, right?
5:07
And so a lot of times we miss, the real impact of what actually transforming someone is life does.
And so I think a lot of times we get lost as Fitness professionals when we're selling because We're trying to sell our widget but the round is that the widget is just a vehicle to get them to the promised land.
5:23
And you have to have a vivid picture in your mind when you are selling to explain it with a promise when really is right?
And if you can, truly articulate that to a prospect like what would it be?
Like if you can have pizza every night, what if you could have cake when you wanted to?
5:39
Because you have learned how to count your Macros, right?
If you had learned how to eat whatever you want but do it in such a way that you never have to diet again, right?
Like what?
Creative freedom.
Be like, what would it be like so that you go out with your friends and you look amazing and your friends are like, what are you doing?
5:55
And then they see you ordering.
They're like, I don't know how you're doing this.
You're like, because I've learned a skill.
I know how to do this now so that you don't have to keep hopping from diet to diet to diets dot, right?
And then we're going to couple that with the fitness component.
So that when you are dieting, so when you are losing battle, we're also going to gain muscle, right?
6:12
You know that muscle burns fat.
Right?
Okay.
Of course you do but we're going to actually tones in the right areas.
You don't mean, this is where I'm using it.
Ittle bit more salesmanship than I would.
Like if I'm talking to you about how to do programming, you know, if we have a six-week Squat and deadlift, someone are no girls are signing up for that.
6:28
But if I have a six-week big booty boot camp, tons of girls are signing up for that, right?
But what do we do, Squat and deadlift.
We're going to be like hip thrust like this but like it, you have to, you have to rephrase what you're saying in a way that the prospect can actually understand why it would be viable, right?
6:44
So to bring this, bring this home for your sales, people if they are losing Else most of the time it is because they have not been able to articulate the value of the promise that we are making.
I want you to set you free from this thing that you have been struggling with for your entire life.
7:03
Since when have you been overweight since I was 16?
What do you think it would be like to not be overweight?
Would you be okay with that?
Do you think your identity would need to change?
Because you probably do you identify with the fact that you're overweight?
Yeah, I guess it's just I've always struggled it, right?
So it's a part of Who You Are.
7:19
So I'm going to tell you it's going to be it's going to be hard for you, right to deal with the fact that once we get you to that goal way, your identity is going to change.
People are going to treat you differently and it's going to really mess with you.
So I'm just warning you.
So there are damaging admission in and then all of a sudden, wow, he's really talking to like Hey Mose, a nation quick break.
7:39
Just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
All right, so send me a connection request a note.
Let me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or Layla's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
7:59
I can't really get there, right?
And so it's the way that you're talking about it, that sets up the stage, a good one that I got from my man.
Nick Eliot is that if you start talking to someone about their way, I'm going a little bit of tension here.
But if you talk to a lady about her we're guy and they laugh about it right there like yeah, man.
8:18
I am right.
They say something like that.
This is like, this is like a gut punch but it will, it will crush you.
Look at the person in the eye and you're like, don't laugh, it's not funny.
Laughter is a coping mechanism that we use to cover up something that we know that we need to do.
8:37
Right?
So right now, you know, that you haven't been getting to where you want to go and see you covered you cope with by laughing about it all of a sudden the tone of the conversation, right?
And then like, someone's looking back, you and they're like, holy shit.
You're like right, you came here to change your life.
That's what I'm going to do.
8:53
Cool.
And then like, literally just like what card you want to use.
So if you want to throw a punch, you can use that.
But anywho if Your eyes are struggling.
The value proposition is in the Gap, right?
It's in that.
Why are you here?
And what's the problem that we're trying to solve and then where do you want to go and you continue to stack and reiterate the value to the point of ridiculousness?
9:15
Like if I were to change your life and all of your children's children are healthy forever because of the habits that you were able to instill, you're able to live 10 years longer is that not worth $200 a month.
Of course, it is cool.
So then you transition to the second part, which is now do you, you need to believe that I can get you there, right?
9:35
And so that's when you get into the conviction part and so it's like, what would it take for you to believe?
But it take having lots of people who are just like you, who wanted to get to where you want to go.
We've already done it.
That's why we have this big wall.
And so for all the people who are my, my crew, we all have a massive wall of testimonials.
9:52
Y'all have seen my wall of gym, owner, testimonials, right?
Like I believe in them because Social proof matters because it works, right?
And so that's where the biggest the biggest piece of conviction is people who have who have struggled with what that person struggling with who have gone to where that person is trying to.
And so the wall of testimonials is going to be your number one then, right?
10:10
And then if that does not convince them, then there is a limiting belief that you need to uncover which is why asking questions like, why don't you think you would be able to achieve it?
What is it that you feel is missing in this program that you feel would be necessary for you to be successful, right?
And that's You have to go back to the back pain and be like, okay, why do you think this failed, right?
10:30
Like you said, you Jimmy Craig, right?
And sometimes it's explaining its teaching because sometimes they don't know why they failed.
Just why they're worried.
It's not going to work this time, right?
So like you did Jenny Craig.
Awesome.
Okay, why do you think you failed?
And they're like, I don't know.
I just, you know, after I kind of fell off and you know, way back like Okay, so, let's let's dive into it together.
10:47
So you started getting better right?
Because they provide the meals for you, right?
Okay.
So you had a calorie deficit.
That's a good thing, right?
That's why you start losing weight.
Okay, what else do you think?
Thing happened to you.
So you fell off.
So did you have anyone checking in with you, on a regular basis, calling you in taking measurements?
Well, we do it once a month there, okay?
11:03
So probably needs to be a little bit more than that.
You probably need more communication.
Keep you on track.
So that the moment you actually fell off from an emotional standpoint.
You can get right back on rather than waiting a month when we already pretty, much made decision stuff.
That's how to rubber, all right, sure.
Okay, so we're missing the accountabilities got it.
All right.
11:18
So do you think we do any kind of exercise during this period of time?
Well, I was kind of walking.
Okay cool.
So Do you want to win?
You get it back, right?
Yes.
Okay, cool.
So if you lost the weight and then get it back.
There's another thing.
There's two other things actually.
One is, you didn't know how to cook, because you're buying the food, right?
11:36
So you never learned the skill of making the food.
So eventually, you know, that you're dependent on this company for the rest of your life until you learn the skill right there, giving you fish rather than you learning how to fish.
So I make sense.
Okay, cool.
So we got that one, so you're missing the accountability, you missed learning the skill, got that.
And the third thing is that when you were dieting, you didn't do any kind of resistance training, right?
11:54
Muscle.
So that you could build your metabolic engine to burn more, right?
So that when you actually get to your ideal weight, you're actually burning more calories.
Not by us, wouldn't that be cool?
Wouldn't you like to get your size 2 and eat the cake that you like?
12:11
Because I may be wrong with you.
The only way that it's going to stick is if you can eat the things that you like, right on the way there.
And while you are there, right?
I'm not saying you're not eat ice cream for breakfast, lunch and dinner, but, but I am saying that you do need to be able to have those things that you don't have to say.
12:26
I will never you take the rest of my life, because let's be real.
You're going to kick, right?
So you need to learn how to do it so that you can literally have your cake.
And have your size, two genes that make sense.
Okay, cool.
Does that make sense?
Why it didn't work and why this is going to work for you?
Look, we've done this.
12:41
A lot of times you can trust us.
Cool.
Okay.
On top of that, just to show you that, I put my money where my mouth is.
If for any reason between now and the end of the eight weeks or whatever it is, you feel like you're not getting the service and the value that I promise you right now, I'll give your money back.
I'll write you the check myself.
Cool.
Okay.
Awesome card you want to use and you're done.
12:58
Okay.
So that's ultimately how you want to simplify the sales conversation with someone Is one, do they find it valuable?
And you can continue to start value to the point of ridiculousness and feel free to because you need to really understand.
And I think like, genuinely everyone is on here, you need to understand what we provide people.
13:17
Sometimes we sell it short because we see it all the time.
We do it every single day.
Some of you, I don't know if any of you guys are feel like this like this who here gets numb to seeing before.
And after pictures, I stopped.
I've stopped caring.
I'll be really honest with you.
I stopped caring.
I was like up.
There's another 60 pounder.
I stopped caring, right?
13:34
Because we're So numb to it because we've taken so many people through this transformation.
They're like we don't even have an emotional attachment to it anymore.
Right.
The thing is that person on that day, it's life changing them.
And so you need to remind yourself what kind of impact we really have?
From a generational standpoint.
13:49
Like here's a good one, generational Health that generational wealth generational Health.
What kind of Legacy are you leaving your kids, right?
What's your health Legacy?
Oh fuck right now.
They're like you had him in your hit him in the throat, right?
It's stacking.
The value and making them.
14:05
We're putting their attention on what this really is and if they laugh throat country, maybe like this is serious, don't laugh.
You're coping with the fact that you realize that you have fit, but that's why you're here.
We're going to change that and that's why you're going to pay me because I am going to change your life, right?
You look at someone like that with balls and they're going to give you their money because they're going to believe you because you better be for real.
14:25
You're going to say that.
So that's the, is it worth it side?
And then if they're like, okay, it's definitely worth it.
They don't believe that you're gonna be able to get them there.
Then you just ask the natural.
Options with just one, look at our big wall.
So obviously we've taken who people like you to where you want to go.
So the next thing is, if you feel like you are special snowflake, which is possible.
14:43
Why do you feel like you're a special snowflake?
Usually it's because of a past failure.
They don't understand as you explain to them.
Why?
That was a failure and why this will be different this time.
And that's how it works.
So anyways, simplifying the sales for your team.
14:58
Hope that was useful for you.
Hope you are having an amazing Tuesday two times Tuesday.
Wanted to give you a tactical Tuesday piece of content, a little bit more towards the gym world because my last like 25 pieces of the little bit more on the pie-in-the-sky version.
If you guys do like this tag and comment, so I can know if this is more the style that you guys, like I can take whatever.
15:18
But anyways, this was one of mine and I hope you enjoyed it and found it valuable tag your peeps in it, track.
Comment, like and we'll see you guys on the flip side.
Comment, like and we'll see you guys on the flip side.0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
What is going on everyone happy Thursday, hope you guys are having an amazing amazing Thursday, a terrific Thursday, tremendous Thursday.
So I wanted to break down the cost of retention, so I talked a lot about cost of acquisition being able.
To outspend your competitors, be able to make money, you know, in the acquisition etcetera so that you can mark it as parquetry I saw.
0:36
But the other side of the equation, a lot of people do want to break down and I want to break this down dollars and cents for you, the cost of retaining a customer.
So if you look at how much it like so the average business, what's up, Steve?
The average gym has a 10 percent month-over-month turn, right.
0:53
So, they losing 10% of their dft's month-over-month.
Now, there's two numbers that I want to tell you.
One is that the average lifetime value of a gym?
EFT is 10 months, 10 months, according to like, mind body.
And what's the other one modifies them player?
1:11
Those once they release Benchmark reports which I always like to go through the difficulty, is that most gyms most crossfit's bootcamp semi private facilities are usually in that 50, 80 100, max type clients.
1:27
And most of those people are oh geez who have been grandfathered In there still being operated by the owner.
So they're usually not owner.
Like the owner is not just owning their usually owner operating which skews the numbers, right?
So that's what the average number is most of the time because most people are older operating, whereas most at least a lot of people watching this have transitioned to at least mostly owning and are definitely not doing any sessions things like that.
1:52
And so I want to break down the actual cost of retaining customers dft's, if you are of transition to ownership, right?
It's what happens.
A lot of times is that you have this base of EFT is the oh, jeez.
You're rich your original gangsters your clients that your grandfather didn't $99 a month who you love.
2:09
They were the bumper stickers, they take up all your time, you love them, but they pay less than everyone else.
And then the the top, you know, the 25%, that's at the top of your EFT continues to churn that you brought it off of marketing.
Etc.
So how do you transition from this kind of bifurcated gym where you have your oh geez.
2:27
And then you have these transient people that are Coming on average, for only three ish, three to four months.
A lot of people who are on here, already know about that because it's like, why is it?
Why is it 3 or 4 months?
So the actual average for people are coming in off call Traffic marketing is much less.
And I don't think it's because of the Fulfillment.
2:43
I think it's because of the fact that the type of owner who's doing that has already transitioned to ownership and it's no longer operating the business.
So let's get to the nitty-gritty.
If that type of gym, which is the majority of people are on here, has a ten percent month-over-month turn for clients.
3:00
Then if we were to implement retention strategies and we were to cut that 23 percent month-over-month turn or less, what does that actually mean?
So if you go from 10 percent to 3 percent that it means that your 3.3 accessing your lifetime, value of a customer three more than tripling, your lifetime value by going from 10 percent to 3 percent.
3:18
So, the question is, how much does it cost to do that, right?
Like, we know how most people who work with us, know exactly down to the penny, how much it cost to acquire customer.
But don't know how much cost you retain a customer Right?
And so if we were to break this down, let's look at the actions that you need to do to retain a customer.
3:35
First, you need to make sure that you're reaching out to every single one of them, by Wednesday of that week to make sure that they've actually showed up.
Okay?
You're not going to do this to the majority of your Club, your people because most of them are hopefully showing up.
So it's going to be majority of people.
Let's say 20%.
3:50
Okay.
Who don't show him that would still be huge but let's say 20% your customers, which would be enormous don't show up by Wednesday, okay?
That's one.
Second is that you're reaching out to all of your Customers on a 14 day basis.
So basically twice per month.
You should be reaching out to them just to say hello check in on them.
You know, pulse check, just make sure they're alive and well, and tracking your stats etcetera.
4:10
Third is usually making sure that you're writing them a hand with the card once a month either, that's inviting them to a member of it.
Or just saying, I love you or saying, hey, if you can give this to a friend of yours will get them a free month, blah, blah, blah, Etc.
So, if we were just to look at those three things, which do measurably reduce churn from 10%, usually, for most people who just do those three things, Cuts them sub. 3.
4:30
So if you go from 10 percent to 3 percent, what is the cost of doing those of implementing?
Those tactics, what's the cost per member per month?
All right, so if you look at it dollars per hour, the actual, so the actual envelope and the handwritten card Etc, us about $2 all in including like the the man, our like, the man-hours that it cost takes like a minute and a half to actually write a card if you're if you're doing, if you take 60 Minutes or write 20 cards, right?
4:58
So and you're paying someone Fifteen bucks an hour like that.
It works out to about two dollars per card, including the stamp and the paper and everything.
Okay so you got two dollars there and then per customer let's say the remaining eight dollars that you have would be another 45 minutes or 40 minutes or so of one trainers time per month, okay?
5:20
So that like let's say the 20 minutes is pushed towards the reach out that you have on Wednesday and reaching out texting back and forth twice throughout the month, okay?
Okay, so that means going to cost you $10 and hard costs to retain a customer.
That's an EFT.
Now, if it cost you $40, let's say because the average person, if you weren't doing these things would stay three to four months, right?
5:43
So it's going to cost you 40 bucks to, to do that for the first four months.
But then if it triples your lifetime value, right?
You go from four months to 14 months, right?
Of left, a 3.3 are 13 months.
Let's say 13 months.
Most Nation real quick.
6:03
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
6:22
So to Triple that you get 13 more months by spending ten dollars extra per month.
So version one is you spend nothing on retention.
And you make, let's say 150 times 4, which is $600.
Okay.
Version 2 you spend $10 per month, including month, one month, two month three month for which, so that's an additional cost that you didn't have the first time and you're getting the same months Revenue that you would have.
6:44
Anyways, so in those, once you're technically losing money, so there's want to be clear about that, okay?
But if you get an additional 10 months on the back, Attend at 15 at $150 a month, right?
We're saying on average then that means you're making an extra 1,500 dollars for an extra hundred dollars of Labor.
7:03
So you got 40 on the front and then 10 months at $10 again.
So $140 all in adds an additional $1500 on the back end.
Okay, so you get a 10 to 1 return forever, always you never have to worry about what a platform you're spending on.
7:18
You don't have to worry about your headlines, you're converting your Or you have to do any of that stuff, but you're guaranteed a 10 to 1 return on your dollars in lifetime value of a customer.
So, do you want to do that?
I think it's a very good use of your time and money.
7:36
So cost of acquisition, how much it cost to get someone in costs for attention.
How much does it cost us to keep them paying us.
Okay, and so if you were to Simply Implement those things and say, I'm going to mentally allocate 10 dollars per month to retain these people.
So let's say your EFT is.
Is $150.
7:53
You're going to say right off the bat, 10 of that, goes two, keeping them, that's it.
So, if you need a mentally shift in terms of how you see the money that comes in 10 of those out, if you need to add $10 for whatever, it doesn't matter at a at a thirty dollar sign up fee, and then that covers your first three months, whatever it takes for you to, like, wrap your head around being, okay with this.
8:11
You need to preach this your trainers.
Because ultimately, if we are, if we claim that we're trying to help people, if that's what we claim, right?
Then we need to help them stick with it and so, When we help people stick with the commitment that they're trying to make, we do a couple things one, we're providing actual value because the person is actually sticking with the commitment, which is the hardest part.
8:32
Our fitness programs are nutrition programs.
The coaching nut, like the actual sessions, none of that, is that valuable?
I'm be super real with you.
It's not why?
Because you can get it at 24 Hour Fitness for twenty dollar, nine dollars a month, you can go and get group classes for less and have a better facility.
8:48
Better parking better everything.
Right?
What is the main thing people?
I'll actually paying for their paying for accountability.
They're paying for you actually keeping them on track.
Most people are more than happy to pay for things that are positive habits.
If they use them, no one has a problem paying for a gym membership.
9:06
Even at $200 a month, as long as they are using it, no one quits when they're using something virtually ever, right?
I mean, unless some cattle, you know, catastrophic whatever government shutdown, you get my point.
But like most times that's not the case, right?
And so our objective Give is how can I get this person to stick with the commitment that they started with right?
9:26
It's much easier to quit a membership than it is to quit a relationship.
And so the goal of these tactics that I just outlined is to build and Foster a relationship and communication with these people.
So you're in tight communication.
So that they will continue to stay with you, right?
9:42
And they stay with you because they're continuing to work out and get healthy which is the promise that we made them when they walked in the door and they give us money.
So How much does it cost, cost?
10 bucks a month. 15 bucks a month.
Top to retain a customer.
Okay, cool.
So you're giving 10% of your gross revenue to 10x what they're going to pay you.
10:05
I think that makes sense.
Sorry 3.3.
Excuse me.
What they're going to pay you.
I think that that makes a whole lot of sense.
So anyways, I hope that makes sense for all of you guys cost of retention broken down if you're not doing that, you should.
Because ultimately, if you don't, you'll get put out of business.
By someone who gets so.
10:21
Lots of love.
Have an amazing.
Terrific.
Tremendous Fantabulous Thursday.









0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else going on, everyone.
And I have a little piece of cuts that I want to make for you today and it's something that's been on my mind for a few days.
And it started with thinking about like dichotomies so how we can have two opposing Concepts that we're both in favor of yet, aren't necessarily applicable in a certain situation.
0:47
And so I think this is the primary source of confusion that everyone has especially in consuming information like the internet influencers.
Whatever.
Right.
It's like well what about this situation?
Right.
And so, what I want to do is give you an example and like the single trait that I have always liked.
1:04
If you look at my, let me pull it up my journal here every day.
If you're like, what is what is Alex's goal for today?
What is my word and every day on my my Jang?
1:20
It's be wise.
So since I've ever been writing things down, at what my internal goal is, what trait I want to embody to my team to Layla.
To the company.
It's always to be wise.
And so, what does that actually mean, though?
1:36
And I think that if you look at billionaires in the people that you try to Aspire to be like we do the thing that got them.
There was how they process information has that make decisions, that's really it because if, if two people are put, you know, in similar situations and then one becomes a billionaire and the other person becomes a prison inmate whatever, right?
1:55
The point is, is that they made different decisions.
And so, how they process information, and they took action Is what differentiated that's it.
And so for me my wish is always that I have the best lens to process information.
So it's like the Wellspring that from there.
Every other decision you make, in your life comes from.
2:12
In the reason that I'm like, my goal for everyone who consumes this kind of like our stuff is that, like, you take everything in and then you ask, is this, is this relevant to me and whether it's our stuff, whether it's Gary Vee stuff, whether it's Grant Cardone, whoever else, you know, stuff that you you look at is is this relevant to me, right?
2:33
And the majority of the time like it's difficult because some one person can say we need to be just right?
We have to be just we believe in Justice, right?
And you're like, yes, I believe in Justice.
And then two minutes later, you watch another piece of content has.
I believe in Mercy?
2:49
I believe in empathizing with people situations, right?
And then who is right?
Is it being just or is it being merciful?
Is it being consistent or is it having Variety in innovating, right?
Like, where do you go?
Because each of them is right, but the difference is context.
3:04
It's when right?
Like, do I need to make content everyday?
Or do I not need to make Cuts in?
Well, it depends right.
It depends on where you are.
And so the question is not like, like everyone wants, right and wrong, everyone wants the Playbook, that's do this, and then this, but the like the reality of life is that it doesn't work that way, right?
3:26
And so, I think Trevor says something dr.
Kashi that I think has been something that.
That I absolutely love from like a thinking about Concepts and put, so he applied it to nutrition when he talks about the psychological binary, but the biological Continuum, which is like, people like to thank carbs are good carbs are bad, right?
3:42
I either a over my calories area under my calories.
Like either I hit my macros, right?
Didn't hit my macros but the reality is that like, it's not.
Are you diabetic?
Or are you not diabetic?
But how diabetic are you, right?
And so, like a lot of these things that we have these traits and like these things that were pursuing aren't like, Should I make content or should I not even content?
4:04
Should I coach my team or should I not coach my team?
You don't mean.
Like, it's not like that.
It's just to what extent and in your current season.
What makes the most sense?
If right now you can't sell it doesn't really matter if you have inbound inquiries because you don't know how to do anything with them, right?
4:21
And so it's can you prioritize what skill sets you need to learn in what order?
Does that make sense?
It's like, do I have the wisdom to know in my situation?
Whether or not this information?
I'm taking in applies, right?
4:38
Like I am one of the, one of the speeches I gave at the summit was about telling your stories, right?
And how to create a weaponized Community by by reinforcing the stories that made you who you are and made, you make the decisions that you made and have created the value system that you now believe in and stand for, right?
4:58
Right.
And so in what ways, you can, you get that there's a language that's that's in your day-to-day interactions with your trainers.
Coaches team that's in your day-to-day interactions with your clients and then if you make content for those people inside of your group or whatever, then that would be that place, but right?
5:16
But if you don't have the fundamentals of business, right?
You don't even have those people to make that for yet, right?
That's kind of the point is like, can you can you prioritize Eyes.
Do you know the sequence of actions you need to take?
5:35
And the thing is that no one person who's you're consuming content from can tell that to you and that's what makes life challenging.
It also exciting is like what do I do next?
And that's where the one wish that I've always had in my whole life is I want to be wise.
5:52
It's like, can I take this information and say like Does this apply to me?
Does this apply to me now?
And is this something that is a Continuum?
Or is it something that's a dichotomy right?
We're it seasonal.
There are times to be just there are times to be merciful, right?
6:10
And like, how do you balance that?
Like there are times to micromanage and then there are times to step back and so like the difficulty and like I think Jack will and the title of his book is that high-tech economy of leadership?
I haven't read it but I'm imagining it's probably about these Topics.
6:25
Which is that like the reason leadership is challenging is because it isn't black and white it's gred.
It's walking the middle path.
And with everyone who's like I want to be all in because it's easy to be all in because when it's all in you don't think about anything.
You just max this out.
6:43
Hey guys.
Real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over An H in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
6:58
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I catch the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
But like that's not how business Works business is gray, is how can I be both right?
7:18
How can I be?
Yes, right either, or yes, right.
How can I do that?
And so I think the answer to that is wisdom is like cannot a my self aware enough to know where I'm at right now in my journey in my path to know what information that I need to put through my decision-making system, right, that I processing way and prioritize information and see which one of these are relevant in which one do I need to act on today, right?
7:42
Right.
Which is why I implore everyone, whoever watches our stuff, to identify your bottleneck right to identify your bottleneck because there are 1 million things that you can do.
There are a million things that you should do to improve your business, right?
8:00
Like right now we are branded, right?
A lot of people have noticed that like what we I thought you did, you said we shouldn't brand.
I think that most people who are watching this like is it contextual for you, right?
Right now we didn't start doing this branding thing until we were 15 million dollar run rate, right?
8:20
And a lot of the people who have smaller businesses that do not grow as quickly focused really, really hard on it and talk about it all the time.
The question is, is that the priority For us, it was not.
I'm not saying that that's necessarily, right?
I'm not saying it's wrong, I'm saying it depends.
8:37
And in our context, it makes sense for us to delay it because we had other priorities before that, that made more sense with limited resources, both human and attention and money, right?
Which one of these things will I do.
And so it's easy to take things out of context and say, like, well Alex, you should never bring no, I'm grieving I think there's a time to do that and I think most people are there.
9:04
Is there an exception always, right?
Of course is, are you wise enough to understand the difference?
That's my question for you, right?
Do you get the difference right now?
Like I'm only saying this because I think I think it was I won't even get into it.
9:22
The point is, is like, can you do you have, do you have the self-awareness to know when to apply the dichotomies went?
You understand like where you sit on the Continuum, right?
And can you prioritize?
The one thing that you need to do which is why I hit on this so many times and like I can call up on by guys doing a lot of Revenue and they're like, how did you guys grow so fast?
9:45
And a lot of times they're caught doing should dues, they're caught doing shiny object syndrome.
So I'm going to start talking about that probably a little bit more SOS shiny object syndrome, which is like, it is so easy to distract entrepreneurs.
It is so easy.
And like the truth isn't sexy.
10:02
Like if I want to distract everyone, I'll give them a new opportunity.
That's what I would do.
I do my new opportunity and just and just sell them on that because new is always The High Ground from a marketing standpoint to better.
But the reality is that most times better is was true.
10:20
And so, like, most people just need to do the shit.
They know they need to do and keep doing it and be consistent about it, right?
Rather than do something new.
The thing is, is that who is exciting?
Better is not more, is not excited, making more ads.
10:36
Yet again is not exciting.
It's not, but it is probably what you need to do, right?
Calling your leads again is not exciting you already called them, but it is probably what you need to do, right?
And so what thing in your business is bottlenecking you and do you have the wisdom to be able to shut out everything else despite the fact that the other things are also correct but may not be correct in your current situation.
11:03
You are contextual situation and so like the only way that you will be able to move faster than everyone else.
It is by understanding which of these zillion pieces of information that you're cut that are bombarding.
You is the right one for you to apply today.
All right.
And like, so that's my wish for you.
11:19
And that's the single trait that I, that, I remind myself every morning.
Like, I will be wise, which means I will look at all of these things that I should do and decide, which of them is truly the thing that if applied, and if applied consistently will make the biggest difference in my business.
And then do it and then don't look at anything else until that thing is completely system of times, right?
11:41
Like I tell everyone here like go make ads.
Do I like, was there a time when that was all that?
I focus them.
Yes.
Now I have a team that makes sense.
So that process is still being done consistently and then I've moved on the next piece, right?
And so like if I did not have this locked in, I would not be Brandon.
12:00
I would not be making content.
I would not be doing these other things that you see me do.
Because there are other things that are higher priority that I did first and that is my belief, given our context, given our situation for how we've chosen to grow.
And so, like are there, differences Shore, where B2B instead of B to C but other similarities, maybe that's up to you to figure out.
12:22
So, anyways, hope you guys have an amazing Sunday.
This is definitely more abstract.
If you can take a moment to like this and comment on it, I think it's like as there's more information, that comes out there.
The searching through and prioritizing information is Will becomes more important, right?
12:39
Like when the internet exploded, the first thing that became the most valuable was the thing that helped you search through it, which is Google, right?
So as there's an explosion of information, the thing that men who creates the most values, the thing that allows you to start with prioritize, which means for you for us for all of us.
12:55
The thing that makes us more valuable is not the information we have access to because we have all have access information but it's like what filter are you processing it through?
Through.
So you can understand and prioritize what's important and what's not today.
So anyways, lots of love hope.
13:12
You guys have an amazing day.
Like, comment and share the friend.
Y'all are amazing.
And I'll get you guys some food.









0:00
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
0:17
What's going on everyone?
So, I hope you guys have an amazing day.
I wanted to make this piece and I said to you before you buy you at you, I'm calling this Flows In bottlenecks.
Because I was feeling the flow and I'm showing you my flow actually, because I wanted to talk about one of the things that I think has been key to our continued rapid growth.
0:40
And it is identifying bottlenecks, and only focusing on those things.
So, for those of you new to this, there are five core functions of every business.
And if you are not reading yourself on them, then it is very difficult for you to improve on them.
And so, if you think about every business is allocated the same initial resources, which is time, right?
1:00
And so I feel like I'm making this half as a spoof because for those of you don't know, there was a spoof piece of content that all the gym Lord's made at that we release that they made as a joke or me making fun of me, which is awesome.
But I'm going to be coming some of those things of how we went from zero to like, I mean, I mean, now we're at like a 50 million dollar run rate in just under two years, right?
1:21
And so, how do we do that?
And if every other competitor in the space, it has access to the same Workforce, right?
They have access to the same things to advertise on.
In order to get talent and they have access to the same information because it's the internet and they have access to the same amount of time per day.
1:37
How can one business move faster than another right?
It's by allocating and prioritizing the things that you're going to work on and making sure that the things that you are working on are not just things that you should be doing.
But are the the one thing that is going to move the ball forward, right?
And so if all of your attention is allocated towards, just the biggest bottleneck or the only bottleneck then you will be able to grow faster.
1:58
So think about it.
Like a flow, right?
So the business flows first from lead generation, right?
Like getting inquiries about people who want to work.
Want your surface, right?
The second thing is lead paratrooper.
So how do we get these inquiries?
How do we turn them into people who are ready willing and able and likely to purchase services from us, right?
2:19
And that comes to two components.
One is scheduling, the other is showing, and the third is kind of a soft component of that, which is having get them to show up with intention to buy right?
Which is warming up a prospect, the third thing.
Thing is sales, how do we convert that person from a prospect to a customer?
Once we have converted the Prospect and we have fulfillment.
2:38
So how do we deliver on the promises that we made but not only deliver deliver in such a way that is so much above what we promised that they are blown away with the Abundant exchange that we've provided meaning they gave us two hundred dollars, but we provided a thousand dollars from the value which is a very fun experiment.
2:53
If you ever want to get into that like getting like getting into it with your coaches or trainers and say like how can we so it pays us two hundred dollars a month.
What would we provide for a thousand dollars a month?
Everything that we would do what we provide if they were paying us a thousand dollars a month and then make a huge list.
3:11
And then cross off only the things that have absolute hard costs and then try and do the rest of those things.
And if you do, those things, consistently people will start / feeling like you're delivering so much more value than you're providing.
And that's when referral skin that's and retention kicks in ETC, right?
3:27
And then the last piece is how do you like?
So you have lead generation lead nurture?
Sales fulfillment.
And the last one is retention /, Ascension, meaning how do we get them to buy again and again and again or Ascension how do we get them to upgrade to a higher level of service, right?
3:43
And so there's the five core functions.
A lot of you guys have heard me say this, there's two other functions over here with your HR and finance which for most brick-and-mortar smaller businesses.
You don't need to concern yourself with but they are functions of business that need to be mentioned.
So how do you identify which of these things you need to work on and then disregard everything else.
4:02
And so Reid, Hoffman.
Who's the founder of LinkedIn talks about how sometimes being a lazy CEOs actually really good.
Because if you're a lazy CEO, then what you do is you try and delegate everything and really try and do as little as humanly possible in order to get the job done.
4:18
Which in some ways can actually be a huge blessing because you're like, man, all that stuff?
Sounds like a lot of work.
What is the one thing I should really do?
And so what we do, every single quarter, which I highly recommend you do right now.
Have it is.
Look at that flow and figure out where the bottleneck is.
4:37
So right now, if you're growing right, it's our rather than having this, if you're not growing, then one of these five things is your bottle neck.
Straight up.
One of them is your modeling.
Typically.
In the beginning, most people think they're about Nick is lead generation because that's the beginning of the pipeline and sometimes that's true, right?
4:55
Like you don't get enough increase, right?
But there's multiple reasons.
You might not be getting enough.
Inquiries You might have really shit fulfillment, which is why no one's asking or knowing sending their friends because they're kind of half embarrassed that they even pay you, right?
That could be an issue, the issue might not be in the generation.
5:12
Maybe suck at sales, you get 10 people walk in the door and you're only closing, two of them you suck at sales, right?
You don't need more Legion, right?
And so once you identify which one of those things is the bottleneck, right?
Then, all you need to do is literally disregard everything else in your life, disregard every other Guru.
5:30
Every, every, like, every Motivational Manifesto, whatever it is.
And then the fix for it is.
One of three things, it's either a person a process or project and I'll cover each one of those.
So, at some point you will get good enough at this thing that you will be able to have a person do it for you for less, if you are able to teach them, right?
5:56
Training is a classic example.
In the beginning, you started training and then very quickly.
You are able to train someone else to train at as high or higher of a level for your clients, then you were.
And so you were able to teach them how to be a great trainer and then you got that time back in exchange for $15, right?
6:12
And as long as you are, able to make more money with that same amount of time, because you have a more valuable skill set, then you will make money, right?
You're getting a positive Roi on the time because ultimately, as a business owner, all we ever do is continue to trade up on our top.
Hey, if you're a return listener and you have not Rated or reviewed the show.
6:33
I want you to know that you should feel absolutely terrible about yourself and everything else in the world getting but it would mean the absolute world to me.
If you guys would go ahead and do that, you do you have to pause the show, you keep listening and you can just do with your thumb right now.
It'll take you less than 60 seconds.
And like I said, the only way that podcast grows through word of mouth and this is you joining hands with me and helping as many isomers with possibly can because no one is coming to save us, it's just us.
6:54
All right, so please go do that now then let's get back to the show.
Right.
Because like like right now what is the act like?
I don't I don't do any of our sales, I don't sell launch out so Legacy, I don't run our traffic, I don't like I really don't mean like so the skill set that I have to have now.
7:13
That's higher is literally just like making strategic decisions.
Looking at the entire landscape of the marketplace and saying like this is where we're going to allocate all of our resources for the next nine months.
And we're going to do nothing else.
That's what I have to do, right?
7:28
And that's a very valuable thing.
Skill.
It doesn't take a ton of time, be really honest with you, but it's a really valuable skill set and so the rest of my time I'm able to buy back by spending money that I whether otherwise makeup I were taking sales calls so that I can do the one thing that matters most.
So to go back right now one of those things is your bottleneck.
7:48
It does not serve you.
In fact it actually hurts your business to do anything but work on your bummer.
I'll say it again.
If you were doing anything but working on the one thing that is holding you back, you're wasting your time.
If you're working on retaining, your customers better, right?
8:09
And I'm going to use lead generation because it's an obvious one in this is easy.
And that's what everyone thinks, so I'll go with it.
But I'm not saying this is you but I'm saying I'm just going to go with it for this case of the example, if your attention right now is that three percent month-over-month like church.
So you keep 97% of your clients month. 213 right.
8:28
Then your issue.
You should not be focusing your time on going from 3% to one and a half percent because your effort will be better allocated on generating more, inquiries rightful form.
It's not your problem right now, right?
8:43
So you basically need to go create something that's going to create the problem again because ultimately all wherever doing is solving problems and so maybe you have a three percent month-over-month turn when you only have two new customers in because you can give all of them back rubs and you can see Sent all of them and text them all every day, smiley faces because you don't have a ton of inquiry, that's right, but if all of a sudden you're signing up 30 new clients a month, right on EFT.
9:08
Then all of a sudden your attrition spikes why?
Because now that becomes the biggest boner and so the difficulty that like here's the here's the fundamental thing that all business owners have to do, he's fix your one problem.
See what next breaks in this pipeline maybe lead generation gets fixed and then no one, no, one schedules are no and chokes.
9:26
Okay.
That's where our attention needs to be.
But when you put your attention here you need to maintain your performance here and that is literally the secret that is it is can you put the person processor project in place after you have figured out the bottleneck and opened it up as a flow?
9:43
Can you keep it open while you move down the pipeline to the next piece?
And that is ultimately how you're able to scale.
Each piece of your business and continue to rise the whole thing rather than saying, here's the five things that are going on in the business, I fixed Legion and then leave nurture was a problem and then you go to leave nurture, but then your lead gen stops is a problem.
10:04
And then, finally, some day, you get lead gen in the nurture to work and then you're like, ah, but I can't sell and so you keep bouncing and juggling back and forth because you don't actually fix the problem, right?
And so when you are fixing the problem, use the three p's and figure out whether there is a person.
10:20
Needs to be there.
A process that needs to get fixed or a project?
And project is a special one because most times it's you as the business owner, the project, maybe I need to go acquire the skill, right?
I need to acquire the skill of training, a salesperson, I need to acquire the skill of learning to generate leads.
10:39
I need to acquire the skill to learn how to make it.
Automated lead nurturing process that's like project and processes together, right?
I need to acquire the skill of creating a system to retain customers and If you think about things in terms of like, the skills that you lack, are the deficits that you lack, you will be able to identify the bottlenecks.
10:56
And then put one of those three pieces in place and then put the skill set on yourself of managing it.
So, if you put a salesperson place, you like, well, that salesperson sucks, he's not consistent or which you can't control right?
Or is that you lack the skill set to create a sales environment that is consistent.
11:15
And when you reframe, all of your problems is what deficits do I have to fix this?
This bottleneck and turn it into a flow, then you'll be able to fix things at a much faster rate and you only need to focus on that one thing and then you'll create permanent Solutions which will allow you to, then you'll grow all five, first, your fix, your legion, your leader to yourselves fulfillment, we summon Ascension, and then you go back to the front again and then you're like, okay, so I've got lead gen on on point.
11:40
How do I do more?
How do I do more?
And then as soon as you do more and Legion, we nurture breaks again because it's like, will make the old system.
I had could work up to this amount then after that, It breaks again sales.
I had one person but I have so many people coming in the door and into a threesome, right?
11:56
And those are the problems that will continue to happen.
If you're wishing that, you don't have problems, you should not be a business because they will always be there.
But that's good growth problems are still problems but they're much better than bankruptcy problems.
So anyways, flows and bottle next, look at your five core functions, figure out which one of those things is your bottleneck, disregard everything else in your life and fix it with a personal project or process.
12:17
And if it is a project frame it in the terms of What skill set do?
I lack in order to make this work or make it work consistently even when I'm not there.
So I can put my attention on the next bottleneck without this one going down so I don't have to play whack-a-mole with my business but instead, I'm able to consistently work my way down the pipeline, increase it, and then start back at the beginning.
12:38
Lots of love, if you can drop a like or comment or anything always, I always do my best to respond.
What skill set do?

What's going on, everybody?
I'm bringing some more books, but I wanted to say that, if you haven't checked out Hunter million-dollar offers, I would definitely suggest that you start there.
I've gotten some solid feedback and it couldn't be happier with its.
Number one ranking on Amazon for direct marketing and over 5,000, five star reviews.
So, thank you guys so much for that.
0:15
It's 164 pages.
I really can help you out.
It takes about four hours to get through, check it out.
On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
The audiobook is lows, they'll let me put it on for it, so I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
Now, I wanted to make a a quick video for you.
0:31
I actually woke up with this on my mind and I thought I would share it.
And so I'm calling this my for highest Roi habits and I know probably should say 3 because 3 is probably a better number before was what I was really thinking about.
So these are the things that were learned behaviors that.
0:47
I think if I look back on behaviors that have been able to have propelled us forward faster, these are the four things that have done that.
So the first one it's up Krista.
First one is waking up at 4 a.m. and it kind of goes hand-in-hand with the second habits, all kind of put these together, which is consistent bedtimes, and that includes weekends.
1:12
So basically consistent time going to bed and consistent.
I'm waking up.
And I know that sounds minor, but a lot of times, and for a long period of my life, I would wake up early, five days a week and then on weekends, I would sleep in and I go to bed late because I was like, I'm living on the weekends and during the week, I'm working.
1:28
And I did that for a long period of time.
The thing is, is like your body doesn't work that way.
And so I think there's the consistency in the most basic way is literally going to bed at the same time weekend and weekday and waking up at the same time week and and weekday, I know this sounds really minor but like especially that 4 a.m. wake up time like us as entrepreneurs.
1:51
Like we're I think we're a little bit more reactive than most blur from an emotional standpoint.
Like I think we're also a little bit more scattered by Nature.
I don't Speaking of myself, I think that's like are in terms of programming and then we can work away from that and so that's why control I talk so much about controlling your space control.
2:08
Your attention is that like we're so much more prone to reactivity, which is also why we want to solve problems faster because we're more uncomfortable than anyone.
Everyone else has which is why we naturally move towards problem-solving right?
And so Wiki up at 4 a.m. allows me to get all of myself work done in the morning.
2:29
And still have two, three, four, five, sometimes dedicated hours to moving the big dominoes for the big projects that are going to make massive impact in the business at are working on the business, not in it.
Basically, once I hit, you know, 9 a.m. 9:30 a.m., I would love to tell you that like, oh, I have had four hours of CEO time in the middle.
2:53
The day that everyone knows that I can't be reached.
The problem is that like you know, if you have a lawyer call come in because Have some, you know, thing or whatever.
Like I'm going to take the call if we have a Personnel issue where someone's like going nuts, you know what I mean?
Like, I'm going to take the call and so like, it's Sherwood sound nice to say like, yeah, I mean, we're so disciplined that.
3:15
Jim loves that Alex never gets, you know, brought in anything and to be fair, the team is awesome.
And like, I really don't get brought into a lot of stuff, but the thing is, it's like my attention.
So gets cooled during the day once everyone else just kind of pop but from like, 4:00 to 9:00 is Like my time.
3:31
And that's where I really move like all of these big projects forward and that's why I like we're like how you get so much done so fast.
It's like, I just think most people don't get very much done during their days at all, because they're working in their business on it.
And so we just move, we just are able to do a lot of things on the business, which then accelerates the entire growth of the business because these are like like the bricks that you lay on the business or the ones that accelerate growth, the things you do in the business is kind of like one is investment.
3:56
One is one is spending cash, you know what I mean?
And expense of time as how you're running your business and investment of time is what's going to move the entire business forward.
And so it's like, are you, are you putting investment time in?
And so for me for am to like nine is like that time period.
So like the to First success like success habits because that sounds lame.
4:17
But like basically the habits that have gotten me that made me the most money waking up at 4 a.m. and that is enabled by going to bed consistently at the same time on weekdays and weekends.
It's just like, you can't.
Wake up at 92 days a week and then wake up five hours earlier and expect to be like a productive individual.
4:36
It's just not going to happen.
So, like I would implore you to just like, I mean and they're like, what about like concerts and like things that I likes going out with people?
Like there's a reason entrepreneurs live the way they do like really how of entrepeneurs live a certain way.
4:54
And it is a sacrifice.
I mean, if you see it that way, it is a choice and so I choose that life and that's the life that I choose.
You don't have to choose that, just understand like you're going to let like that's your trade off like and for me going out to dinner at 7:30 on Friday, is not important to me.
5:14
I'd rather go like all of my friends who are here in Austin know that like they're going to go out with Alex and Layla.
We're going to dinner at 5:45, right?
So that we like get there receded, we get sir, like, we're eating by 6:15 and we can leave by Seven drive home by 7:30 and then we can wind down there like they know that going into it and so like it's just like if you don't want to play that then like that's cool but it means that like our relationship isn't valuable enough for you to eat dinner earlier and that's fine.
5:44
You know what I mean?
But most people are game to do that and they're like, you know, it's so nice.
Being will get back at 8 and like, not ruin your routine.
I'm like, yeah, it's awesome.
Like, that's why we do it.
So first, you waking up early and then consistent bedtimes on the weekends, especially, The next one is this is a little bit different, but this is something that Layla has told me has been like one of the things that she observed early on in our relationship before she like, knew me as her husband but like just a guy that she thought was doing things, is that Jenkin this man?
6:19
It sounds kind of weird saying it.
Like, this was her observation that she thought I should bring up in.
This was that like genuinely trying to give to other people in your network without Ation.
And so, like I was, I've always been voted like, into like president and Leadership positions and like every organ is like when I was in high school I was present newspaper and president of the literary magazine.
6:44
When I went to college I was person VP of the power lifting team and president of the of the fraternity I was in like it's like you don't even think it's Hugh is on and the thing is is like, most people think about leadership is that like I have to be the big boss, man.
It doesn't work that way for those you ever studied.
It's like the people who get In the power of the people, that, that like it's funny.
7:03
We always think like, the prison, the fraternity is the one that's like the biggest rager, but the person that they want to vote in to present is the one who's going to take the punch bowl way to make sure that like, when the party's getting going to make sure that like we don't get arrested and like, you know why things happen the way they're supposed to and it's and it comes from a place of servant like serving and so it's literally just giving without expectation and that comes to clients and a lot of times Like I would see some of the highest Roi givings that I've done, have been two people in my network where they're like, hey men, do you know anything about this and then I will go the extra mile to connect them with, not one person, but like for people do some initial screening myself and to hey man, like this is what I saw.
7:52
This is what it looks.
Like, here's two people that I think might be able to help you and then this is my experience with it and they're like holy shit.
Like thank you that's like Also, and then what happens is, like, you actually form a much better relationship is there like wow, this person like really cared, right?
And then also in the future, if I say, like, hey man, do you know anything about this, then they returned the favor.
8:13
Right?
And so Layla jokes but she's like, you have so many favors that you like have uncalled upon like so many iou's.
Just like, I feel like whenever we need something like you, like you have three people, you can call immediately, jump to help you.
And the only reason that happens is because I jumped to help.
8:29
Them with nothing, like, exploit expecting, nothing back, but just because I know that like long term, they may have something or know someone who, and that's not because of that, it's just like.
And that's why it's like sort of a nature nurture, you know, whatever.
But I can tell you, like, if you can help people, you will get more back and your reputation will also follow from that.
8:53
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
9:12
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
And so those are, those are probably the three biggest Roi habits.
The fourth one is what likely leave us and that I should I should mention what she's like you should say something about sales and I joked back with I was like I think that's more of a skill set and not not not a habit, not a behavior but I think if there were to be a habit that would be associated with that.
9:48
It's it's jumping into a skill that you are not good at with the expectation that my first 20 hours.
I expect 0 return on and so like if you can look at new skills that you are not good at or do not like we always have this discomfort with acquiring new skills.
10:04
Like let's say, I don't know how to run Facebook.
As I don't know how to make a landing page.
I don't know how to manage a team, whatever it is, right.
Like you're going to suck for a while and I think if you can remove the emotional, Blockage that stops you from taking action because most of us don't sit like start that new thing because we were afraid of sucking like just being real.
10:28
Like we're emotionally afraid of sucking it and so if you think to yourself I'm going to get 0 Roi for my first 20 hours.
Ironically the first 20 hours where you get like 70% of your gains in any you skill and then like everything after click Power number 20 is like massive diminishing returns that happens after them, right?
10:47
And so like if You just jump into it with 0x patient 4, verse, 20 hours.
You'd be amazed at like, like how many people here if they actually tried like those are you are on here?
We're like man, I really need to learn how to Market.
If you Google how to run a Facebook ad and you spend 20 hours watching videos on how to do it, you will be better than 99% of people who try and Market.
11:10
Because no one doesn't fit like seriously, like no one does anything like and like most people suck at most things including the things, they think they're gonna write and those ones.
They also mentally usually aren't that good at either.
11:26
It's because their pride because they associate the fact that they're good at it and then they stop learning because they think they are good because of their ego.
And so that's actually what the fourth and was going to be else.
Like I know she said sales so I think that the force, the fourth habit Um, was a is is absolute responsibility for all situations, so it's absolute ownership of your life.
11:53
If anything happens at any time in my relationship, with Layla, with my relationship with an employee with my relationship with the marketplace or whatever it is, like, you have to school yourself and literally beat the victim out of yourself, like you have to, like, you've to drag it.
12:09
And Beat the crap out of it until it has no strength in your life saying, like I'm going to blame my circumstances, I'm going to blame my past, I'm going to blame my upbringing in a play, my spouse.
I'm gonna play my employees, whatever it is, it does not move you forward if you point the finger anywhere, but yourself because then it literally gives the power away to the to where you're pointing your finger.
12:29
You're saying, I want the power to be away from me.
Like, I want the power to be away from me, and then I'm talking to my clients to, like, if you ever blame Jamal much.
And, like, I will take complete and extreme ownership over.
All of your situations because that is my job.
But if you want to grow as an entrepreneur, you should take extreme ownership and and put nothing on our buses.
12:48
And I'm talking to you like person to person, right?
Like I will always try and over-deliver, always, but the point is, is like, if we're talking about like my for highest Roi habits, first one is waking up super early so that I can have time to dedicate to Big dominoes.
The second one is so that I can have consistency in my life and weekdays and weekends are the same to me.
13:04
So waking up and going to bed at the same time.
So that consistency in the most basic way.
The third, I totally forgot what it was but it was, I think it was good and then the fourth is absolute.
Oh yeah.
Giving first without any, any feelings of reciprocity and then the fourth is absolute ownership.
13:26
And I think that of all the habits that I've had to learn in my life because each one of those was learned like I was not an early riser, I did for a very long time, like having different weekend schedules than Weekday schedules from like a sleeping standpoint etcetera.
13:44
And to be fair of all of these, I think the one that I that came, most Ashley to me, was the third one just getting first.
And I think that come upon us, say, from a place of insecurity is like I wanted everyone to like me and so like if I get into a new group and he networking group, like I spend a lot of time, typically asking people what they're struggling with and like, what skills I have that match up with their deficits and then doing everything I can to over deliver to them.
14:10
Like, like treat them as though, they paid me to help them.
And then they're like, dude, this guy's amazing and then I feel like my anxiety goes down inside of our group, so that might just be a me thing, but it has been something that has.
I've been able to drive a lot of value from a monetary standpoint later on in my life by being able to call on people who I had done favors two paths.
14:33
And then the fourth is literally never giving anyone power over your situation.
By saying it's anyone's fault, but your own and I will leave with.
I've said this before, but one of my favorite quotes is that we are all self-made, only Millionaires and billionaires, and so like, everyone's like, he's a self-made millionaires to self-made, billionaire.
14:55
It's like that person's a self-made, homeless person that person to self-made, average person, like, but they don't own that and there's a reason for it.
No one says it.
Because the type of person who's going to say that they're self-made, is going to have the Abbott's in the outlooks, that is going to achieve the things that they want.
15:11
And so I will leave you with that, as my for highest Roi have it.
If you have a manager or trainer or partner or whatever, I would highly highly recommend especially the first two, they're the easiest things in the world to do like get your get your bio-clock like regular.
15:32
Like you show up as a leader better, you have more energy, you have more focused people like you get so much.
Stuff done is lie cuz I'm fucking exhausted.
The time rightly, excuse me like I'm just not tired, you really need it.
So I can like work and get things done.
That are productive and effective uses of time because I'm just not exhausted.
15:48
And so like imagine if you like felt good all the time, like you can do that.
It just comes from consistently going to bed at the same time.
Dr. Kashi I will say one more thing.
Dr. Kashi jokes that.
So he's a my PhD but who made off Prestige labs and is a nutrition genius PhD by 21 and biochemistry.
16:08
Pablo.
Anyways, he's like people just people just pay me to tell them to do things that they should already know how to do.
He's like I tell them to not eat like an asshole and I tell them to act like an adult and go to bed on time.
They're like man.
16:24
Like how do I how do I have more energy of battle?
Like, I'm taking all these things and they're not working.
He's like, why don't you try sleeping?
And and then people sleep and then they get like like, oh my God, this changed my life.
It's like yeah, amazing.
16:40
And so it's like, so I tell them to like, eat consistently every day.
The same thing, just you consistently.
I don't even tell them what to eat, and then all of a sudden they start getting healthy because they're just consistent with something right.
Does it matter what you're consistent with halftime?
Being consistent is in and of itself.
16:57
Something that most humans can't do so anywho.
I hope this provided To you this morning.
And I hope that I said this on Instagram, post it in, and I kind of like, it may your desire to be greater than your obstacles.
17:12
So, lots of everyone.
Hope you guys have an amazing day and you crush your goals.
Try out some of those habits, try out some of sevens.
I think that they were very high Roi habits, and I think that if you do them so amazing, it get you soon.









0:00
Real quick.
Cause you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
Boom, what is going on?
Buddy, hope you're having a fantastic.
Another thing I want to make a quick piece of context.
I was talking to my man, Dana the myth Derek's about just interesting concept that I like diving into about influence and making money.
0:44
So, one of the things that is my biggest pet peeve, what's up?
Rebecca is when I see people, especially trainers, especially trainers, at your gyms who are spending time and attention thinking about what they want to make for content and how long they want to make their Instagram post for that day and obsessively.
1:01
Checking, how many likes and comments, they're getting on their Instagram post for the day and what they're going to post in the Facebook group and all this stuff because they have it backwards.
And so it's kind of like a Telltale sign of like a neophyte entrepreneur in my opinion, when someone is trying to gain influence but have not done anything that is influential yet.
1:18
So if Rewind to think, like, why do, the people who are sitting with these massive followings, all these things, like there's, there's two, there's two big categories, you've got category one, we've got, you know, Mark Zuckerberg, you've got Warren Buffett, you got Elon Musk.
You've got guys who have 510, you know, million followers or whatever on Instagram, but they didn't gain influence to make money.
1:43
They made money and made an impact and provided value.
And then gained influence, as a result of that, as a A by-product, but a lot of the generation that we are growing up with right now and, like, the societal commentary is talking about, like, like everyone's got, everyone's like seeing the smoke for the fire or whatever, like they have it, they have it flipped so it's like, I need to go get people to follow me, rather than learning the fundamentals of the game, right?
2:09
And so you see these people who have 60,000, you know, followers or whatever because that's all they focus on, still not making enough to pay rent because they didn't learn the game.
They don't know.
No business.
And so like, there are people right now who, who are in by our space, for example, and we'll talk about Their branding in the constant and they're all this, all this stuff, right?
2:36
And at the end of the day they're literally 100th of our size.
And so there was a, there's somebody who's recently telling me about this saying like well, hey man, like perception is reality and like I think reality is reality.
Like if you've got, if you spent all this time, branding and branding, and making all like, all this content, like I would take all of that time and focus on.
3:01
Acquire customers and providing value, right?
Like, Mark Zuckerberg doesn't care about how many followers he has, because he's a billionaire, right?
Like there are a lot of entrepreneurs who don't have Instagram policies and make tons and tons and tons of money, right?
3:16
Because like, you don't like, there's just this huge thing with like, associated with the status and it's such a waste of time.
And so tell, you were trainers, like stop checking, how many likes you have to make comments, you have on your post and focus on the game at hand.
So like as us is Jim owners, if you were to take the time and attention that you put towards making content, which for a couple reasons, I don't think people should make it one, because I think making good content is really difficult.
3:41
I think it's very hard to make good original content.
Takes a lot of time and attention, and I don't think that with the average homeowner is that I talk to you every day.
A lot of times being candid with you, I don't think they have something that's truly different to say, right?
And so, I think that if they were to take all of that time and attention of the checking of the commenting, the responses, and all of that stuff, tough and were to just work there damn leads or make 10 more ads that week they would make more money.
4:12
And they would reach more people and they would build a business, not a following.
I hope that makes sense.
So like if you have X amount of time and attention this whole making content is a lot like a should do that.
I was talking about in one of my other pieces like a couple weeks ago, there's a million things that you should do in your business, right?
4:33
But one thing or what, two things am I going to take with the limited resources that I have of time, tension and money, right?
You've got so much.
Time so much money and so many people human resources that you can allocate to the thousand things that you can probably do to make more to improve your business, right?
4:50
Like if I could do all of them, they would all build the business.
But if I have to measure how much I take, how much time and attention, it takes to make a blog post, make long-term stories and then in like, people are like what only takes me like 30 minutes to do that.
5:07
But how much time does it take you in attention of like, is this the right picture?
Is this the right angle?
Is this?
What?
I want to say today and then how you feel about a posted doesn't do well, and the comments that are associated with it, how much that draws if we were to get rid of all of that and just focus on generating leads, nurturing leads selling providing amazing service and the fulfilling.
5:30
You probably make more money and enjoy life a little bit.
So, Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
5:45
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, That is my that is my two cents for.
If you think about some of the biggest changes in the world like McDonald's owners aren't talking about beef patties and the different versions of bread.
6:10
They're just running a business, right?
And so I guess the bit, the main piece that I try to wait like that.
I want to make here main point is that I don't want anyone to ever feel guilty about not making content because they're focused on their business.
You have it, right?
6:26
Right?
You don't have it backwards.
The world has it backwards like you don't need to go get influence to make more money.
You need to go make more money to help more people.
And then by extension, if you gain influence, awesome, I genuinely do not care how many followers I have.
6:43
I don't care like how much bigger someone's brand is in our space, because it doesn't matter.
There are guys who are in our space who have hundreds of thousands of followers on Instagram, and YouTube, and make less, and health less than we do in a year.
7:02
Sorry, we we have more people in a month than they do in a year.
All right, from an income standpoint, from how many gyms they help all of that, because like, they're so much time and attention.
On being in front rather than doing the thing, doing the work, right?
7:18
Like here we are making like the fourth full makeover of Jim launch and likely looked, I mean, she was like, this is why we're like this is why it didn't come from a place of Pride.
When she said that she was like this is why we're like we're going to serve this industry better than ever, right?
7:34
If you think this is why because like we're doing this and like we do not feel like doing this again, like I'm making all of the videos again, making them pretty with a nice everything up. updating the words in the software and the scripts and all the things based on the best practices that we already know, we're doing that rather than speaking more conferences so I can get more b-roll footage so that I could drop some sick, Instagram video like it's just It's just not the game, like you can just go work on your business, provide an excellent service, make a great product, make lots of money and you don't need that, that's how I feel about.
8:10
So, I think that if you focus on the main functions of your business, you helped lots of people.
Your influence will grow.
You don't need to go search for influence in order to what make more money.
Just focus on making more money by helping people.
All right, lots of love drop a comment tiger trainer, who makes too much content, it should be focused on learning.
8:28
How to sell learning how to make better ads, learning how to teach a better class rather than focusing on the details that do not matter.
And you can ask them how much money have you made from Instagram?
How long have you been working on it?
How many hours have you put into it when you got back?
What's that Roi per time?
8:45
So you've spent the last two years building up your following to 8,000 people.
Awesome.
How much have you gotten from you?
Have to customers how much do they pay?
$200 a month, okay?
And you spent three hours a day thinking about it?
9:01
Refreshing, it commenting, back.
All of that, for $200 a month.
If I had 90 more hours per month, three hours a day, right?
Even two hours to 6000.
Ours is meant to, I got $200 for that.
I don't know.
9:16
The math is, it's not good.
It's like three bucks an hour, it's nothing.
So ask them that question, ask them if they've done the math on their time and their attention of whether it's worth it.
So it maybe you should do that too.
If you're like in that game, have a great day.

Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
What is going on?
Jim owners, Fitness professionals, love.
Purrs of business around the world.
Today is tactical Tuesday at a gym launch turn down Tuesday, which means we don't have meetings on Tuesday so that everyone can GSD and get things done.
0:41
So I want to talk to you today about is the for client Milestones Sizzle, bit more tactical because it's acting Tuesday and how you can hit all of them.
And if you don't well first, you should know what they are and second, your teacher know what they are.
And then 30, sure processes should support actually making them happen.
0:59
So The for client, Milestones are the four things that we structure all of our Communications engine launch to hit.
So this is what we want and ideal customer path to look like from an action or end result standpoint.
Not necessary.
This is not like a touch Point list.
I mean, touch points are, you know, we have hundreds of touch points that already rescheduled from time.
1:16
Someone starts in launch, or really from the time, they opt into the time they started launching then from there all the way to Legacy and Legacy on words, right.
But there's four main Milestones that we want for someone who's a new client.
Alright, and so this is what but this is I got this from the gyms.
1:32
I took it directly from how I ran the gyms to how we run, Jim Lynch, everything's identical.
So the first thing you want any new customer to do is going to be connect.
All right?
So it's going to be connecting with in your environment within your community.
And the reason for that is that in the beginning, is when they're the most at risk, right?
1:48
The first 7 days or so, especially in Fitness, but it's even the same thing in our business.
First, it's like first seven to ten days is where there are most at risk of leaving because of overwhelmed.
Because they don't understand what's going on.
Because of whatever, right?
A million different things.
And So within the gym, the first thing we want is basically have them have a friend and so that they connect with other people at the gym and then also with the trainer.
2:09
So that's why if you like, okay, like this, is your accountability, buddy.
This is your accountability coach.
Each one of these people is checking in this is the person who's going to be expecting you on Tuesday.
And then like on Tuesday before that day starts, if it's the first day, the trainer's going to message them really hate, just letting you know, I'm expecting you to 6:00 tonight.
2:26
Super excited to meet you Rosie.
I'll be the guy with the backwards hat and a beard, you know, And then face pic, right things like that, that gets them connected in the community so they know that you care.
Alright, that's connection.
The second thing that we want them to do in second and third are kind of interchangeable because it depends on the type of customer that you're dealing with.
2:41
So, 2 & 3 are refer, and testimonial reason that they're interchangeable.
Is that there's some people who walk into a gym, love it and are like, I'm bringing 10 of my friends.
They've even done a testimonial but they're just like they want people to come and do it with it.
Alright, sing thing with Jim look, we have some gym owner shoe, sign up, love the process up to that point have already consumed a ton of That in like just in the first couple days are like I'm going to tell my friends, right?
3:03
And so, those types of people are hyperactive buyers.
They're awesome buyers when you get those people, they're awesome.
They always extend all the way up the phenomenal.
And when you have someone like that you want to give them the opportunity because those tend to be influencers.
All right, so like for example me, I bought this brand new shirt that I really liked and I think within just the first week of me, having this new brand of shirt that was like really flexible.
3:23
And it was like button down shirt or warm at the summit.
I think I probably referred them. 20 people who bought shares from them.
Right.
Just in the first week.
I was like, this is awesome.
Right?
But some people aren't like that.
Most people who are saying or not like that, they're like, you know, I'm gonna, I'm gonna wear these jeans out for a little bit and see how I feel about it, where I'm going to try this game out for a little bit, because they're putting the reputation on the line before they use their Capital, the relational capital and say, hey you know what, this is good and just as a fun nugget for you guys.
3:50
The reason that people refer, who this is a good one, the reason that people refer as because it increases their status, right?
And so sometimes we wonder like, why do people pay us and yet?
They're not Not referring.
So the reason for that is because like we're good enough to solve their problem.
But we are not good enough to be so good that when they refer friends their friends with thank them for the referral.
4:11
The only reason that people refer people to a business is to increase their own status like like it's take that in.
All right, like the number one reason that people refer people to a business is to increase their own status.
As in, they gained relational capital in that relationship, which is why they're so free to refer people to a business if they're just mediocre.
4:33
Because then it's like, do you told me to come like Use these guys are learning that good, you sold me to use this dry cleaner and they were late and I still have a stain on my shirt, right?
Or like the person that wrote this was kind of a dick like why'd you like why'd you send me here right.
And then they lose Capital.
So there's a lot of risk in making referral because it's their status that matters and so the only read like and so most times you're the range of just not good enough to refer but not bad enough to like leave.
4:58
And that's where the biggest range that most people sit in, right?
And so you need to be above that in order to be so good that they're like, this is exceptional.
I'm going to get bonus points by referring people to this business, that's how referring works.
Okay, so first stage is connection.
5:13
You got to get them into the community meeting people.
That's what we have, many events is one of our first things, we want every new customer to do at the gym for us.
Jim leyritz, we try and do the summit's and try to get as many people to the summit as we possibly can, because we know that when they connect with other people like them, they stay is much higher.
But also, because when you connect with the people, those people help you solve problems, and then like actually helped, like, they create better support, like people who Go have better outcomes like it's better for them for real.
5:38
It's not just like a business trip like they're better so connect is number 12 is refer 3 is testimonial and so right now if you have a process with Hey guys, real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
5:55
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 leads but you will have the unreleased chapter it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com.
6:11
Forward slash leads it.
So free in exchange for email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller leads and so that you can not miss out on it because last time I sold out for like eight.
Weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
In your customer lifecycle of asking for the testimonial.
6:30
And you don't need to ask for a testimonial within the context of Fitness, it's like, hey, so for us to give you the best feedback, I need to know what your stats up, right?
So give us your progress and like that's like and then show them what you think that post should be like, so within Jim walk, I'm sure a lot of you guys who are in this in this group.
6:51
See the post that are like, you're my stats, right?
Here's the amount.
Like, This how much we've spent over this many days is, I mean leads to so many schedule.
This may show this many clothes at this price.
Point is total revenue and then experiencing comments, right?
If you notice, they're all the same.
Why?
7:06
Because we show everyone, this is how you get feedback, right?
This is how we can help you because then we know all the stats would be like, hey, you're showing slow.
Hey, you're close ranks low.
If we don't have the stats, we can't give feedback.
The same thing is true at your gym, but right now, I'll bet you a lot of the testimonials as you get aren't structured because you haven't given them the structure, you haven't given them the template of what they're To do.
7:27
And the reason a lot of people don't host it's because they're afraid of messing, something up there.
Like, what if it's not right, well, that's not right.
Even though there is no, right.
But you just need to give them a template.
So they feel okay.
And then they have a structure so that they can report things, the way they know that you want to receive them.
And then, ultimately, so they can communicate their progress in a way that's actually useful for you to give them feedback, all right?
7:47
So why does General check more testimonies that?
Everyone else?
Multiple reasons?
One, because we deliver better than everyone else does but also because we have a process around, collecting them, right?
And so for that, I have one person on my team that full-time.
All they do is collect, testimonials for all types of things.
Why?
Because different parts of the business, every single day when we have our Huddle's for each department, we go over testimonials client wins for that department.
8:09
So, inside of launch, those are you aren't there?
When someone says, Hey case, he's a rock star.
He totally help me fix my pics, alerts, you know, deep freeze, amazing, she helped me get these campaigns running.
Are, you know, metal is fantastic.
She helped me set this funnel up.
We screenshot those and then we put those into the into the daily huddle, for the next day.
8:25
So, That person Kudos and shout outs, right?
And so same thing for them, they get status with it.
Our group about doing a great job and so right now if your trainers don't do that, it's probably cuz you don't have a reward system in place for them to get kudos.
And so one of the objectives like on there, for our documents for a customer service Superstar for us is how many Kudos are you getting?
8:48
Right?
And so, they know and they can ask for them.
So it's like they have to do such a good job that someone would willingly, right.
A post about it.
Like that's the goal is that every interaction is so good that someone would feel obligated to say this was so amazing.
9:04
I have to let everyone know about it.
That's the goal, that's the goal of every interaction that we have on our customer service team, right?
And that gets funneled into their presentations and that they get status within that group.
Same thing goes for the client like our company-wide stuff, every single weekly meeting, we begin with clients and the marketing team is going to have the client wins around how great the new campaigns are.
9:26
How everyone's getting all these newly costs that are just amazing right?
And like overarching company.
Stuff is just all the stories about how Jim's turned around and how like these are the stats of what they were doing before.
And then one year later those are the ones that drive the entire company for, right?
9:41
And so Milestones are connecting them within the community.
Giving them people that they can know from both a professional side.
So accountability coaches, but also in the personal side of other clients and getting them to those events.
ASAP second, you're Trying to get them to refer right?
9:58
Some people do it early, some people do it after the testimony of, that just depends on the client, right?
But you need to give them a structure.
Any process to do?
So, every single application that we have in Jim launch has who referred you?
Fun fact.
I think I said it before, but I'll say it again because it was so powerful for me when we were at our Summit.
10:15
I asked everyone like, hey, let's try to prove a point about like it's not about the marketing, it's not about the sales.
Everyone always thinks that were marking the sales experts.
I think we're far more delivery and fulfillment experts than we are marketing and sales.
I mean shit we haven't even changed our funnel two years, right?
And like I think there's still a video that has been work on it, right?
10:32
Point is when I asked who here was referred by another gym owner at our Legacy Summit three-quarters of the hands were raised three quarters.
You get a lot more from your marketing and sales when people see your stuff and then they reach out to two people and those two people are like, yeah, it's for real, and then they take action, right?
10:51
And so anyways connect refer testimonial Oh, and then, the last one is resale or Ascension.
And So, within the context of your business, this looks different, right?
And so within the context of Jim, there's two different ways.
Actually there's really three different ways so resale can first.
11:09
And at the very basic level is is transitioning from a funding program.









0:00
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, what's going on everyone?
0:20
So what I want to talk to you guys about today was something that I've been repeatedly requested after the last piece of content, I made the for high highest.
Roi habits that I've developed.
And there's, there's honestly more feedback from that one piece than a lot of the other pieces that I put out.
0:37
And so because people want it, I, which is always surprising me because like, I don't know, like there's some things that I think are super super interesting.
A lot of times that is not what everyone finds him State.
And so these are some things that have I wanted to give you three more habits because some people were like, will tell us your nighttime ab, and honestly the nighttime habits are somewhat covered in the first one.
1:00
Um so these are the three.
Hi.
Like I would say the next three things that would be habits that I've developed that that how like Layla and I live that seem weird to most people but have been so part of our life that it I mean it's just like part of how we live.
1:17
So first one for me, this is one that's probably a little bit different for me than Layla.
Is that actually wear the same thing every day.
I changed my shirts for Content so that you guys don't so that it looks different on Newsfeed.
But I actually wear this pretty much every day.
1:33
So it's a gray shirt.
I've got like six of them there from Lulu.
I wear these blue sweatpants and this is kind of like my winter outfit and I wear red tommix right.
And I wear them because they're really comfortable and I don't have to untie or tie the shoelaces when I wear them.
So actually wear the same thing every day.
1:50
Why do I do that?
And if you'll see the common theme between the things that I'm going to show you is that it's just decision fatigue.
So when I wake up in the morning, I'm not like debating about what I'm To where I just immediately put on the same thing and then I can like save as much juice as I can't.
So that's number one, may sound minor, but I think a lot of life is like adding up these tiny details that save you juice and then over periods of time, it results in really massive things.
2:16
The second one is that I eat the exact same thing every single day.
So I ate the same breakfast.
I ate the same lunch and at the same dinner and I don't know about you guys, but there was times in my life, 14 like counting my macros, and things like that, that all Always be like, what am I going to have inside?
2:31
Like, you know, I spend like 10 minutes like deciding and deliberating between what I was going to eat for lunch, you know what I mean?
And I can't tell you how freeing it is to just like, always eat the same thing and never think about it.
And so, I would implore you to try and find the three meals that you actually really like and just stick with them.
2:50
It also makes body composition really, really easy.
So like it's really just a question of how much, not what so it just like simplifies.
Your life in that way.
The third thing that I think I'm saving for last because I was actually going to do a challenge and I might still do it for the gym Lords, but is actually sleeping on hours every night.
3:12
It's a lot of times sometimes it's funny because Trevor, Trevor, dr.
Kashi jokes about how like people need somebody with a PhD and all these fancy things to tell them to do things that they should already probably do, which is like, yeah, he's probably, like, eat the things.
3:27
Don't eat like an asshole.
In his language and like yeah like we were like I'm so exhausted I'm using all these stimulants.
He's like have you tried sleeping?
Hmm.
And so what's really interesting in like I'm going to I'm going to hit on this a little bit because I think it's worth it for everyone who's on here.
Like all the research in the like the world about sleep is like it's really hard to get too much of it.
3:50
Like most people don't oversleep like virtually everyone understands and so a lot of it's like you were literally smarter when you have slept more and so everyone's trying to get an edge on everything.
When like a lot of times, I don't know if you've ever had this happen, we've been struggling with something and all of a sudden you get like a great night's sleep and then all of a sudden, the, the solution seems obvious to you soon as you look at the probably like, well done, that's what I would do.
4:10
Why didn't I see this before?
Because you weren't capable of it because you didn't have all of your horse power at your disposal.
And so like if you want to be wiser you want to be smarter, right?
Like you want to show up better for your team, you want to be less reactive, you want to be less emotional, right?
So that you can make good decisions.
4:27
Slowly like for real like we get good sleep so everyone hears like, oh Alex sleep, you know, wakes up at 4:00 a.m. like it means Alex, Alex is working all the time.
Like not really like I finished my day at 4:00.
So like a 4:00 p.m.
I'm done after for, I usually take 30 minutes to like slowly sip on pre-workout and it also like partially do that because when I drink pre-workout, like I get all tingly and then I have to work out.
4:51
So that's like one of Alex's tricks is like I just drink my pre-workout when I don't want to work out and then by the time it hits me.
I'm like well shit I should I should go to the gym because otherwise, this is going to be really uncomfortable.
And so from like 436 4:30 to 6:30, I lift.
5:07
And then after that, it's the same same, exact brand, same, exact DiGiorno pizza, every single night, I have a whole pint of caramel macchiato Halo top paint that every single night I do with chocolate sprinkles.
You don't mean like ate the same stuff and then after that Layla and I watch one episode of whatever Netflix show were watching at that point and we're done at like 8:30.
5:29
Like so, like I finished lifting and then we have two hours between 6:30 and 8:30 that we basically eat and like unwind and like, people were like, well, I mean, there's a lot of things about like sleep hygiene.
They're like, don't don't do screen time, I don't know.
We watched, you know, we watch Netflix and has really affected my sleep, and I was, I mean, I have my phone out while I'm doing it, usually responding to people.
5:51
I don't know.
I mean it's I'm just telling you what like what we actually do and then when we actually go to sleep, like we're usually asleep by 9:00 so not like, well, I get into bed and then it takes me an hour and a half to get it.
Like we're asleep.
6:06
Usually by nine latest 9:30.
And so, when you go to sleep at 9, you've got three hours before, midnight that, you're asleep.
And then you have another four, four and a half hours that you're asleep.
If you wake up at 4:30 so like if you think about REM Cycles, I mean I I look into sleep a lot and so everything happens in ninety 90 minutes Cycles with REM sleep for the most part.
6:32
I think our admire like Ed but most people run around, 80 80 to 90 minutes cycles, for REM sleep.
So if you're like, if you're, if you're going to sleep, it's like sleep either.
Three hours, four and a half hours, six hours, seven and a half hours, or nine hours.
6:48
And so what I'll say is like, for me, I usually see about Enough and I usually just wake up so I haven't set an alarm and I can't tell you.
The last time I set an alarm in the morning I sleep as long as I can and so I think the biggest secret is to kind of piggyback on the last one that I made is like just kind of go to sleep earlier like for real.
7:09
And if there's some things that stress you out, don't do it at night.
I know this stuff sounds like super simple but like a lot of times when like, we get up on stage and people are, like, what are the secrets?
It's like most people know what, like, what they're supposed to do.
They just don't do it, right?
Like that's like for real, right?
Like most of your clients, know how to lose weight then you stop eating shit.
7:26
And then you just start moving like, for real, like they kind of know, that's what they need to do.
And so, sometimes it's like, man, I gotta listen to this person who apparently is doing all these like, none of our stuffs rocket science, right?
Like we go to like we wake up earlier because it's quieter and we get a lot of stuff done and get like basically get ourselves into a good state so that we can show Gulf of the team so he can show up off our clients, we cannot be reactive, so we can make better decisions and we're well rested because we want to For right?
7:52
And then I try and decrease all the decisions that I have to make during the day.
So I wear the same thing.
I eat the same thing, everything in my entire house is labeled.
So every single light switch on, if you can see it, there's little little letters underneath of each.
One of those switches.
There's all those letters.
It just says, what each one of those like says anything that I have to think about we try and take away, right?
8:11
Like everything that we think about we have to take away like we use instacart, so don't go grocery shopping like like we have the buttons from Amazon.
So something runs out.
We just hit the button like all of these.
As we do to just make our lives easier so that we just have as much decision-making abilities.
We possibly can.
8:27
And that anything that would potentially throw us off during the day doesn't have the opportunity to do that.
A most efficient quick break just to let you know.
We've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright.
So send me a connection request.
A note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
8:44
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
Show.
And so later told me a staff from Harvard Business Review that was like, mistake. 80% of terrible hiring decisions are done because somebody's tired and so it's like, it's the simple stuff.
9:05
It's just like it's so simple.
That no one does it like, you know what I mean?
Like, it's so simple, that no one actually does it.
I can tell you when you sleep really well, you make better decisions, you're smart, you're wiser, you show up and you're happier and like if you are happier in that, compound summertime like your team is happier and you show up better and your business.
9:24
It's a so like maybe you don't need some hack about culture and Leadership maybe just need to sleep, an extra 90 minutes real talk.
I remember, I was, I watched not watch, I was in college and there was a macro economics, professor.
He was showing a graph about subjective well-being.
9:41
So, like happiness and income and basically from 0 up to seventy thousand dollars, the more money you make, you actually get happier.
Like, you are happier when you make, like people who make seventy thousand dollars a year.
Happier than people who make fifty thousand dollars a year on average over.
9:57
All right, take home and so like people actually get happy and I think part of that is just because it allows like money up to a certain point allows you to avoid pain, right?
And so money can really, really, really help.
You avoid pain, can't buy happiness, but it can really help, you avoid the negatives, which is, I think very valuable.
10:15
But after that point, there's no real correlation between how much you make and how happy you are.
But what's interesting is that they did another study that I was like, most people would be happier if they just slept 90 more minutes than if they made an extra fifty thousand dollars a year like the actual impact on their subjective well-being, which most people who are entrepreneurs started their business because they want freedom, they want to be able to do their own thing.
10:41
And they honestly just wanted to be happy, right?
Like at some point, that's really what people want.
Is they want to be happy.
I want to be fulfilled, right?
And like what if all of these other things that we're doing would be better served by not doing them and just sleeping like minutes?
So I'm hitting on this hard because it's like, for real, for real, my life improved when I slept more, like I didn't need to use all these stimulants during the day because I slept more.
11:03
So like my use of stimulants is going down and then I mean I still enjoy some notes, I'll be very honest with you, I do but I don't need them.
And so like a very like I drink decaf every morning with Layla because I like the habit of drinking coffee.
I like our time together but I don't like the caffeine per se and so I'll use stimulants during dedicated period.
11:23
Time.
And then when you are well rested, and you don't like, I don't know if you guys have done this, like if you're tired and then you need stimulants.
They so Trevor something that they mask fatigue, more than they enhance.
And so, like it just, it just helps you operate in a shittier State better, rather than taking you from good to great, if that makes sense.
11:45
So anyways point being like big secrets here are like we do the same things every day and we don't make exceptions for a week.
Ends, I've got a friend who's coming into town and he knows that we don't drink and he's a friend, he's the longest Trend.
My oldest friend, please the same age, but like he's my oldest friend in my life.
12:04
So he's visiting for two days.
He's an FBI agent.
Kind of cool.
He's actually wanted to be an FBI agent since we were in middle school, and he is, and my senior superlative was like, I think I've told you guys was Will own and operate a chain of global shapes.
So, like, everyone know what we're up to.
12:21
But anyway, so he's coming in town, he knows we don't drink.
And so like we we literally don't make exceptions for this like we just we make zero exceptions.
We don't take on speaking events if that we feel like the travel is going to be tiresome because like our routine is so important to us.
Not because of some like weird reason about like routine being some like magical thing.
12:40
It's just that like it decreases the stress in our lives and like as you continue to grow the stress only gets higher or the potential to be stress.
Only gets higher, which means you have to make everything else in your life less reactive.
Think about it from a fitness.
Standpoint, right?
When we're squatting and we're trying to generate power, you try to solidify everything else.
12:59
You try to solidify like chest up, butt back.
You hold you like you hold your breath.
So you can be rigid so that you can transmit power.
And I feel like that's the same thing as like if we can make everything else in our lives rigid, when we need to make decisions, we can output maximum power of One Direction rather than being so unstable.
13:14
Because we're like because we have all these micro drains that happen throughout the death.
And so my last habit that I will give you and you guys If you've been following my stuff for a while, this won't be a surprise.
I don't.
I pretty much cut off my communications so like right here, I'm on Facebook.
13:31
But I don't have the Facebook app on my phone.
Simple.
Simple stuff, man.
I'm not like none of this is rocket science.
Like I take all the things.
Anything that gives me anxiety.
I take it away anything.
And so like some people are different, you know?
Some people getting is like, I don't get anxiety for Instagram.
13:48
I think it's maybe it's just because the people who like, like, no one like messages weird, like it's also because of all, our groups are Are probably on Facebook and there are no groups on it.
Made it hard to use the app that long but like Instagram is stress me out, Facebook stretches, man.
And so I don't, I have the Instagram app on my phone but Facebook and I don't and so like if you have things that stress you out like don't put them on there because like they will detract from your like mental power and then you will become less able and you become less wise, become more reactive and your team and everyone else around.
14:16
It feels like so to recap, this for you, Through the same stuff every day, right?
Like if you have a shirt that always fits you, right?
And just buy five of them, and then don't think about anything else, right?
Makes it easy, like, eat the same stuff every day.
It also makes buying groceries really easy, it makes keeping everything you never run out of stuff like everything system size and then body recomposition wise.
14:39
It's really really easy because all the variables control.
So if you like what to be fit and not think a lot about it, the same stuff.
Crazy and then beyond that try and get try and get as much like trying wake up every day without an alarm, like that's probably that's the goal.
14:55
And so for me I do that by just going to bed early.
And I don't, I don't really usually need much Beyond, you know, seven and a half.
Sometimes I need done and sometimes I'll sleep all night.
I'll be like, damn, how about that?
And so they're like, yesterday.
I woke up at six so I slept nine hours yesterday.
15:13
I don't know why.
Maybe I trained really hard, I've no clue.
But I felt amazing.
I was like man I wish I could sleep but like that will literally make you happier make you wiser.
Make you smarter then like books will on like positive like the power of positive thinking like sleep 90 minutes more.
15:30
Like try that like how to be happy to your team?
How to lead?
Well like sleep, 90 more minutes you'll be happier and you'll make better decisions and then finally, like take the take the mini, the mini, the mini drains out of your life.
So all the things that piss you off on your phone, don't put them on there, like any things. the drawers in your, in your, on your Whatever, wherever you, keep your clothing, all those drawers label, all the lights label, all your, where you put your clothes label, where you want to put your shirts, your dress shirts, you're like all that stuff.
16:01
So that you never have to think about anything, like put all those Amazon buttons, like those are investments in your time.
So I can put all those Amazon button, eat the same shit and then after a while, like life becomes automatic and then you're basically running your human existence on autopilot, so that you can use all of your horsepower to develop the big.
16:20
Things the fun thing so you're not thinking about we're going to eat tonight, you know what I mean?
Or like do I have butter?
You know, I mean like you all to think about that stuff because all that stuff taken care of so you can put 100% of your power towards that and it's you're well-rested power.
So that you're like extra wise and extra smart because you have all the potential.
16:37
So anyways, I hope you guys enjoy this.
If you, if you did, you know I always appreciate a like, throw a comment.
If there's anything that you're curious about, I'm always having to make more stuff in this direction.
If this guy, this is what you find, interesting.
I'm always Amazed because I don't know.
You know me.
16:52
Like I don't know what?
Like I thought the talents that thing I mean yesterday was freaking awesome.
Like I think that like a geek out on that so hard but I let the I love the likes in the comments to the do the talking.
So if this was interesting, you drop a drop Comet and otherwise have an amazing day and I will catch you guys soon.








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
Hello everyone and welcome to the gym.
A podcast.
This is Alex and I am going to be your host on this beautiful Friday morning which may not be the time that this is even been released, but it's Friday morning for me.
So anyways, I'm here with my co-host Charlie Charles he's a tiny, like six pound, dog, and doesn't speak, but he is always felt spiritually.
0:49
Anyways, what we're going to talk about today is how to run an awesome event and make money from it.
Which from all the stuff that I talked about, I like to tell my clients and my high-end clients.
If I'm ever going to tell you to do something, it's always going to have an Roi component to it.
1:07
I don't believe in branding, which you probably heard it one of my other podcast and you know, Beaver like build a culture.
I want to build a culture if that's going to make me Roi that I can measure.
If it doesn't then I don't want to do it.
So I it's I'm not against some things.
I just think that there need to be ways of measuring just doing things for the sake of feeling.
1:25
Good is not on my list because I feel like there's always gonna be Something else for a business that is going to be able to actually have Roi that I can measure and is well worth that time or better use of that time.
Okay.
So here's how there are a lot of ways to do events.
1:42
By the way said, I'll probably talk about this more but here's how I, you know, like to do them if you're going to do it a bit for Jim clients, then you're going to want to do it and not make it for everyone.
Okay now that sounds kind of crazy, but here's the point.
1:59
Pointer.
Because remember we're trying to make dollars and get more clients.
And so I like it to be a referral based event and have it be something that people can gain significance and status from and something that encourages others to then mimic those people's behavior and something that those people can brag about, okay?
2:18
So let's say you do a spa day with 10 of your clients, right?
Or if you want it to be bigger then you can have it be, you know, a bigger event.
Now, the Is it if you do a really big event that you, what you want to do is make it tiered.
So let's say you, you have like the top, Spenders at your facility and the people who have referred the most people as Tier 1.
2:40
Tier 2, is people who are good customers and may be referred, you know, one person and just like pay on time and are generally friendly.
And then you have like the rest of your email list or slashed active clients who are just going to clients, blah, blah, blah, blah.
2:56
If you're doing scenario 1 and you doing a small event Small event tends to work well because then people are like why didn't I get invited like oh you didn't get invited cause you don't refer anyone and they're like oh what?
You're like yeah.
Oh yeah you get to the spa day.
We'll do another one in a few months to get into that one.
3:13
You just got to refer some people and now all of a sudden you created scarcity and Status all tied into one.
And the only thing that they have to do in order to gain that thing that is now scarce and that gives them status and something that they can brag about like a spa day with you.
3:29
That only the exclusive best clients get.
They have to refer which is free sign ups.
Now here's one of the interesting things about referrals and I gosh I could go down this Rabbit Hole.
Referrals are amazing for a couple reasons actually for a ton of reasons.
First thing, the faster you can get someone to refer the more likely that that person who referred is going to set.
3:51
So it increases the lifetime value just by the act of referring.
All right?
Second thing.
If someone refers and now they say longer, they're more likely to refer again, so compounds.
Right?
Third thing, the people that they referred has the benefit of one being less price resistance so you can charge premiums second, they send faster through your value ladder third.
4:16
They too are more likely to refer someone as well, because they came through River.
And so the chain continues and so I can't Over emphasize how important having referrals are and having little exclusive events.
4:32
So on a gym owners, don't wanna run a huge event doing tiny little events.
Like this can be so powerful because it creates something to Aspire to.
And for you, you can only hang out with people that you like the most.
So it has a nice benefit, they're okay, but you want to publicize it, you want to take pictures of it and like you can call it like client VIP Retreat and not have marketed it, right?
4:54
And people start asking you when you come into the gym like Why like what was that?
I didn't, I didn't hear about that, right?
Oh yeah, sorry, it's just, it's just the top refers.
If you send someone now, they want to now, they're leaning in and now they're doing something because you just said, like, oh yeah, you don't have that status and people are very, very sensitive to that.
5:14
So that's how you do.
The small events.
Big events is probably I try to keep these as short as humanly possible.
So I will not dig into what the big events can do.
When you are inviting people, I highly recommend using Direct Mail, actual like, physical direct mail, and like, a FedEx either handwritten, or like, personally signed at least invitation for those people that you want to come.
5:40
It just makes it like way cooler and it makes it enhances the experience.
So to recap, if you want to get some referrals, not only just from the people who are your best clients because those are the ones who are most likely to refer.
Anyway, so you might as well treat those guys the best, right?
And you want to have a small thing.
5:56
Do an exclusive cool Retreat events, followed a whatever with your top, ten clients or top 15 clients, okay?
And then take tons of pictures and then advertise it, send them direct mail to give them the invitation in a cool way to RSVP.
And then, if you want to bring 10 and then tell them to have a plus one, that's a really great way, because these are the people who people who are high Spenders are people who value your business, the most and are also, the people who are most likely to have friends who also would be high.
6:27
And the same thing with with people who were, you know, top refers.
If they bring if their top prefers they already have a large Network and have a lot of influence.
So when they bring people there, most likely to sign up again, they have the most good to talk about you and me.
So if you had imagined, you have your 10, top clients you sell them on to bring someone.
6:42
Now, you got 10 more clients from an event, you take pictures.
People are like, man, I want to do one of those you're like.
Well, you maybe you will, this is something you can do every other month and it has a huge impact and people really dig it.
So use that Prophet.
Make sure that you have an Roi is calculated from the event, it's really easy when you do a small one so that might be a place to start but if you want to do a big one, then I will cover that in a later podcast.
7:07
So I hope you guys have an amazing day.
Use micro advance to your advantage, treat your best customers even better.
And show everyone that's in your network, what it, what it, what it looks like to be a best customer in your business and how much great treatment they get.
7:24
And so I with this beautiful Friday, Earning Charles.
Jimmy other words.
No, announce have a great day.









0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually a pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
I have a fun, I think topic for today and I'm calling this becoming an expert business person with everything you already know how to do.
And the reason I'm titling it That is because I've been having long conversations with dr.
0:32
Kashi.
And that's kind of what can I do on the weekends?
It's just talked about life and business and all that kind of fun stuff.
And one of the things that became more and more apparent, and that continues to become more and more parents to Layla and I as we as our business continues to grow and as we grow, is that a lot of times the advancing in business doesn't have to do with anything new, but has to do with remembering the basics and Before you before, you check out for a second.
1:01
Be like, well, hold on.
That's about the basics.
Like, I think that there's something really, really profound in this message and it's that Like, for example, with sleeping more, I made a piece of content about sleeping more in.
There was tons and tons and tons of positive feedback, and I appreciate that.
1:18
But what's fascinating is that like the people who are the most In-Shape, are the people who do the basics consistently, right?
That's what they do is.
And so I think that what becoming an expert, or what becoming more and more advanced is is not necessarily learning, quote, Advanced tactics or Advanced Techniques.
1:38
But it's literally never not doing the basics.
Never not doing the fundamentals.
And so, if you were to think that you visited a business, right?
What's up, baby?
You you go to a business and you're like, wow, this this sandwich shop is amazing, right?
1:54
Everyone like I came in, they greeted me with a smile, they said my name, they remembered my order and then went like and everything was fresh and it was toasted and it was well wrapped and it wasn't dripping, you know?
I mean in my bag wasn't soggy.
All of these things, right?
2:10
None of these things are earth-shattering, but what separates the best businesses from everyone else's that they just never forget to do that, right?
You go to a hotel and it's like, what separates, the five star service from four star 3 star to star?
It's not that they're doing anything different, right?
2:26
They're doing everything that they know they're supposed to do.
Except they just never don't do it right?
And so I think that like and in some ways I feel like it's incredibly a humbling but be It's comforting to know that you don't need to necessarily no new information, right?
2:44
Like we have the information.
So one of the things that Jim words quote for me a lot is like we need to be reminded more than we need to be taught, right?
It's not like we don't we always are looking for the new shiny tactic, the new hook, the new whatever.
But the thing that makes the business amazing or exceptional is that you consistently and never forget to do the fundamentals.
3:03
Like you always post new ads, you always work your leads adequately.
When someone comes in, the person is always Jedec always smiles, always greets them by name, right?
Always gives them the pre questionnaire, the pre-qualifying questionnaire shows them around the facility shows them before and afters.
Like and when that happens every single time, then you create memorable experiences because we know how to do that.
3:23
We just don't do it because we don't do it consistently because we're looking at the next shiny.
Whatever.
Right.
And so like if I could, if I could just give you that, that this one thing is that like the people who are Advanced just do the things that we all know we should do, we just don't do them.
3:39
Regularly.
Right.
Like the the quote, you know, the billionaire mornings or whatever, right?
It's like, they just always go to sleep, on time, they always wake up when they want to wake up.
They always do their routine in the morning.
They always work out, right?
They always eat at the same time, it's whatever it is, right?
3:57
They always do those things.
And that's literally the difference.
That's it, right?
The people who are the most In-Shape, it's, they always do it that sometimes, right?
And so in, sometimes like, I feel like in business, like people were we, you know, Furniture looking for the advanced tactics, the expert things, but I can tell you having like, now spoken with some people were much higher than we are.
4:17
Like there's nothing there, there's no secret, we don't know.
They just do it like and it's almost become this joke, like the higher, the higher we go on the higher up.
I talk to people, were doing nine figures, you know what I mean?
Multiple when I figures and we have these conversations, it's almost like this.
You everyone wants that secret, right?
4:34
Yeah.
It's like they just don't know that.
It's just like we just always do the basics and that's it.
It, that's it.
And I feel like that's incredibly freeing because it gives us the permission to go and Excel.
What would become difficult is actually doing things consistently.
You're right, like, that's what's hard.
4:51
And so if we turn our attention to consistency and to process, which is what which is the opposite of what most entrepreneurs want to do, because we like exciting stuff, we like new things, we don't like process, right?
We're like variety.
We don't like consistency.
And so, it's just, it's crazy because I feel like start where what you do is like The thing that got you started thing that got you from 0 to 1, is literally the opposite of what you, what takes you from one to Infinity, right?
5:17
From 1 to n, right?
And so it's like the the rebel, the rebellious that starting something new.
Though the breaking, the mold is what gets us to to be the type of person to quit the job to risk it all to start our own thing, right?
But everything after that point, it's all about the things that we hate doing and that's why it's so hard is because all of the traits that make us who we are.
5:39
Are are geared enough to get us to start and then everything after that is about unlearning.
All of the things that started us into getting us to do the things that we need to do that.
Our customers needs to do that the business needs to do, which is about consistency, right?
It's about boring shit, right?
5:55
And so it's how can we make sure that we never forget?
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
6:11
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
Right?
We don't need to be taught.
We need to remember what we need to already be doing.
6:28
We know what those things are, we just aren't doing them and our staff isn't doing them on a consistent basis.
And so like, if we were to take all of the energy that we're putting towards new and sexy and cut it out of our brains and just say, like, how can we just do the things?
6:43
We already know how to do and do them every single time?
Always I guarantee you that your gym will grow by a lot, right?
Like a lot.
Like we see these, we have I'm sure some of you guys have had you experienced an amazing business, right?
6:59
Whether the whether it's a hotel, whether it was a restaurant with her, like whatever it was, there's nothing that they did.
That was Earth Jack.
Like if you go to Chick-fil-A, the reason Chick-fil-A is so amazing.
Right is, there's nothing that's really like the sandwiches are good.
7:14
Don't worry about the sandwiches are good.
The sauces are good, but there's lots of other fast food places that have this stuff.
Why is Chick-fil-A better.
Why is Chick-fil-A the most profitable like fast food chain?
They have zero.
They're billion dollar-plus company.
How do they do that?
Right?
Because they never don't do the fundamentals.
7:30
They always smile.
They always greet you.
They're always excited.
They're always kind, you know, I mean, it's like it just happens every single time and that's the difference and you multiply that over thousands and thousands and thousands interactions.
And that's how you get all these five star reviews.
7:46
All this word of mouth, all the stuff because every single day, the fundamentals are executed and so That was my, that was my house.
My message for today is that becoming an expert business person.
A lot of times is it about learning more things.
It's about remembering to do the things that you already know how to do and making sure that they get done every single day all the time.
8:05
And that's both your personal skills of the things that make you a better person in terms of like how you show up to team, how you show up as a leader, whatever things you need to do.
Get the right head space so that you can operate be your best version.
But then also the same things for them, for your team.
Like how can I get them in their best dates and they can execute these things?
8:23
Instantly because like you read the book how to make friends and influence people and I remember every single time, I read this book every single time, it's the book that I read the most times out of every book that I have in like the business world.
And ironically is not about business about being person, right?
How to make Friends and Influence People by Dale Carnegie, the reason it's lasted, this long right?
8:40
Is that none of it, like, it should be called the fundamentals of people.
Right?
Is that like, if you, if I read it every time I get to the end and I'm like, I should read this every month.
Like I think that's my son.
Like I should read this every month.
Why don't I read this every month of such a I should be doing this, right?
And if you were to just execute every single thing in that book, you would be phenomenally more successful than you are myself.
9:01
Included, Grandma saying you, we would all be phenomenally more successful than we are.
The difficulty is just doing right?
Is just being consistent is always remembering people's names.
Always smiling, never complain.
You don't need always asking questions taking absolute responsibility like all of those things are in the book like it's in the buckets.
9:17
Like it's like in the entrepreneur starter pack.
It's like the personal development starter pack and so if we don't need new things right which If like if everyone just did everything in that book and that's it, they would think wouldn't need to read any more marks, right?
You just need to do the things, they're right, right in front of you that you already know you need to do and I don't know.
9:35
I think I think sometimes maybe give yourself a break on learning new things, until you've actually executed the things you already know how to do because there's literally no point in, adding more information.
When you aren't even doing the things that, you know, you should so lots of love guys, and gals, hope you have an amazing day and I'll catch you guys on the flip side for a like, and a comment or 50.
9:54
And I'll catch you guys soon.
And I'll catch you guys soon.









0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
What's going on everybody?
Hope you guys are having a two times, Tuesday, Tech Tuesday, turn down Tuesday, which we're doing a gym launch.
Tuesdays are day that we do not have meetings and we do that.
So that we can get more stuff done.
0:43
Along the common theme that I've been asked, I've been getting a lot of questions since I've been trying to cater my concept towards what y'all have been saying you like.
And so I thought today would be something that you might also enjoy because a lot of people ask me I think I got more questions about what Journal I use and all that kind of stuff.
0:58
After I posted a picture of it on my Instagram.
While it up.
And so I wanted to talk to you about.
I think about the most important part of the, The Morning Journal for me, and it's the four questions that I always ask myself and when you start my day.
And so, first off, I'm not perfect.
1:14
I do not do this every day.
I try to.
And I, you know, I try to and I don't like the word try, but my, my intentions did you piss to do 100%?
So I just don't want to pretend like I'm perfect.
I'm not, but I know that the days that I do ask myself these questions.
1:32
I am in a better State.
I should have Butters leader.
I make better decisions and make wiser decisions and so I figured I would share them with you.
And this one shouldn't be too long but I'll tell you to the questions and you know Layla and I mean lately is even better at this than I am.
But we've gone through so many different journals in our lives.
1:49
You know, looking at, you know, the which which which ones that like we've used apps.
We've used books.
But I mean it's makeshift like, whatever, right?
And I would say that the like Let me talk about the common things you see and things that I stopped doing and I'm sure maybe if you've ever Journal you stop doing and then I'll just I'll tell you the four questions that I think that are the most important.
2:08
So I think if you look at every journal, they're always like top three things I'm grateful for, right?
Like, you know, that you start that, but what happens is, if you start doing this every day, usually you stop, you start running out of things to be grateful for and then you either, just start skipping it.
And feeling guilty, then you're like, wow, I guess I'm not grateful for anything.
2:27
And I don't have anyone else has experienced that.
But but of course, we're grateful for things, but sometimes it's like especially the morning where you drink coffee or like, man, like I'm grateful for the air conditioning that it's the right temperature today, you know, I mean you start getting weird because you do want to repeat the same thing but you know, sometimes your great for the same stuff, I'm grateful every day and I don't think that's bad, but I think the question necessarily isn't as good as a daily thing.
2:48
So that's just an example of some questions that you find regularly that aren't as, you know, useful, in my opinion.
So anyways, here are the four things that I asked.
Myself every morning.
The first one is what person do I want to send a note or token of thanks to say that I'm grateful for and so it's a little bit different than, saying what I'm grateful for.
3:13
Because a lot times you when you try to think of what you are great for, it's hard to kind of draw upon blanks, but who you are grateful for, I think is a lot easier and then it allows you to take action on it.
And so, you know, people from my teeth before my family, you know, people in your life, like it could be employees.
3:29
It could be customers but literally starting your day, bye-bye writing, someone a small note and just sending it to them via email via text whatever and just saying that you're grateful for them, it just gets you in the right Zone and I can't tell you how much it means to a teammate.
You know, like People that you think know how much you appreciate them, you know on a regular basis maybe it's your operations minute, maybe it's your head trainer like I can't tell you how much it will change your culture.
3:53
If you just say hey like you are valuable, I appreciate you.
Like we could not do this without you and I'm super grateful.
I have you on this team and like I look forward to doing all the things that we do together and you did X Y & Z that one day.
And I can't tell you how much it meant to me.
So I just want to say, sincerely, thank you and all your effort doesn't go unnoticed.
4:12
Like it doesn't need to be, you know.
Extremely long, but it just has to be heartfelt and genuine and I can't tell you the amount of times, I have people who messaged me back at her like saying, like you made me cry this morning when you sent me that and it's just like, if you have that ability, which we all do like use it and it starts your day.
4:29
Awesome.
Like, you feel great?
So, instead of saying what you're grateful for, see who you are grateful for and then like what note, you want to send them, so there's kind of an action tied to it.
Like, who could I send?
So, the question would be, like, who could I send a Gift or a note to say thank you and that you're grateful for.
4:48
All right, so that's the first one.
The second one is.
What am I excited for?
So I think that's like a little bit.
It's a different phrasing but it like kind of gets you excited to think about like what are the things that are coming up today that I can get excited about?
And so in some ways it positively framed your day so that you're looking at Allen's of like your day as opportunities basically, to be excited, which is cool because I feel like excitement is something that's a little bit of a childish emotion and I sometimes I think we all should be a little bit more childish.
5:14
You can connect with that and so, it's just like, these are things that are that are excited about.
These are like, these are some meetings that I have with some developers.
These are this is a meeting.
I have with an employee, whatever it is, right.
And sometimes it, even if you have some mundane things, you can get excited about them, just by saying it will.
The third one is kind of, as a piggyback on that one, which is what what things could stress me out today and how the best version of myself handle it.
5:39
I think this is one of the most profound questions that I've grown the most from, because just like, as a leader, You know, we have to show up every day.
We have to be the rock, you know, for our company.
And a lot of times entrepreneurs are really emotional people.
We're crazy.
That's how we like stop our job and like decided to start doing this thing without any knowledge of what we're doing, right?
5:58
Like that's not normal.
So taking extra steps to ground.
Ourselves is really important, you know?
And so what are the things that could stress me out today, where the things I could possibly, you know, throw me off.
And what's interesting is that like when you actually ask yourself Question.
6:15
It's usually not that big of a surprise, the things that will that will throw you off.
Like, you know, the things that probably drive you nuts.
A customer could reach out and ask for a refund, all of a sudden, out of the blue, an employee could show up late, or not, do something that they're supposed to do.
Like, you can know what these think.
6:31
Like, we already know what these things are, right?
Or if you have a meeting, that's that's why I said it was piggybacks on the excited.
If you have something that's important to you, that you are excited about the flip side is, if it's not good, it could stress you out or bum you up, right?
Right.
Hey guys.
6:47
Real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
7:02
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I guess a partner with you.
So that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
And so if you know what your day looks like, then you just write down that you know, like I do not write sentences period, I don't write sentences.
7:23
Uh I got time for sentences like I write a word or like the beginning of a word because it's just the thought that matters in my opinion, some people like journaling.
I mean, that's cool.
I don't I got I got shit to do so with with the, the possible stressors, when you write how you your best self would respond to that, stressor, it kind of Reprograms, you.
7:46
So that when that happens, everyone's like, man, he was on it or she was on it, like she didn't even skip a beat like, she was totally present and black responded in the best way ever.
And so like people start to gain more respect for you because they're like, man, like she is unshakable, he is unshakable when something that totally would have thrown me off was and your vendors will respect you more because you're not emotional.
8:08
And I can't tell you.
One of the biggest things the world is like if you're dealing with vendors if you ever do like being emotional or being all over the place, Sucks for them, you know I mean like because then they're like they don't know what to expect and when you ever have your people who just like with your team, if people don't know what to expect from you, then they're always on the defense and then they don't produce their best work.
8:29
And so, a lot of times, you can even take full responsibility for a vendor's work, which is something people don't do, but you can totally speak into a vendor and start and praising them for the things that you want them to do.
I've told this in past things while won't get to off track.
So first thing is, who could I send a thank you.
8:46
Note a note of gratitude that I appreciate them.
The second is, what am I excited for today?
What are the things that get me jazzed up?
And I think that's just a positive lens on your day, which is good.
The third is, what things what things could stress me out, what things could trust me out and the, how am I going to respond to those things if they come up and we all know what they are.
9:05
And then the fourth one is what are the things that made me uncomfortable yesterday.
And so there's probably some times you have these lingering lingering cobwebs, your, I mean, Anxieties from the day before that came up, right?
And so, it's like, what?
9:21
Like my mom called, why did that bother me?
This person reached out.
Why did that bother me?
And so, a lot of times they're also, like, you can use the stressors from yesterday.
To inform the things that could stress you out today and so when you the reason that we write those down and so that you can think about how can I fix these things.
9:41
Is this a person that I need a higher?
Is this a project or is this a process that need to put in place so that I no longer experience this?
Because whenever you are uncomfortable, you need to fix it, right?
If you're Jim sucks, you need to fix it.
That's just a joke for those of you who don't know.
But if you have a, if you have things that make you uncomfortable like you have to change that because if you don't change it, It it will ruin you, right?
10:04
It will continue to drink from your over and over and over again.
So, like, writing out those things of the things that bother you yesterday are just going to get also, it just makes you aware of the like, of yourself, really, and the things that bother you, but you might not even know about you.
So those are the those are the primary for and then I'll give you one bonus.
10:23
Bonus question that I ask myself which is like what one thing do I need to get done today.
Like I, you know, some people like what are the top five and like shit mate.
If I did five things every day, I'd be stoked.
Right?
Like, what's the one thing that I got to get done today, right?
10:38
And no matter what, like, if you have, like, if you do the one thing, you'll do other things, but I feel like, if you give yourself, I'm a big believer in setting goals that I can actually, demolish.
I'm not a big stretch goal person.
That's just me personally.
Some people were like, shoot for the moon land Among the Stars.
Like I just don't like failing and so like I want to dominate every goal that I set.
10:57
And so if I start my day.
It's like well let me get momentum and just crush this one thing and then I do that, I feel like everything else is great.
It's all bonus time and I know that if I'm only picking one thing that I have to get done, only one that I'm going to pick the highest party thing, whereas sometimes you're like top five, you don't do the hard work, the wise work of thinking which of these top five is the most important.
11:18
You're like well these are all things that need to get done but like which one of them is the most important.
And so that's my opinion of like how I like or like how do you stay organized.
I was like I'm not Not that organized.
And so I just try to do one thing that's really important and then that moves a lot of the big pieces forward.
11:34
And then after that, I'm like, I'm on free time.
I'm on borrowed time.
So it's like sure, I'll redo this thing, I'll redo that thing.
But like I did the one thing that I needed to do and so, I mean, there will always be more work to do.
And I think that writing down a shitload of things just stresses you out.
And then you keep carrying forward this to do list from page, to page to page in the butt by like two weeks, and you've got like twenty six things that are on your list.
11:57
The like it just stresses ux feel like a failure regular like I'm not doing this.
And so then you just like all of a sudden you like skip two days and you start over your list.
So it's like just pick one and actually do it.
I know this sounds ridiculously simple but the advanced people aren't Advance because they knew they know sexy things.
12:13
It's just because they just never done to the basics.
So, those are the four questions.
I ask myself every morning if you could Tap into those, those like things common things, all that good stuff.
I would always appreciate it.
I'm sure somebody else who you tag would appreciate it too.
But recap for the four questions, who am I going to?
12:31
Who am I to tell them thankful for today?
Like and who am I going to tell like actively like what am I going to write to that person?
What am I excited for today?
What are the things that could trust me on how I'm going to do with them?
What made me uncomfortable yesterday?
And then what's one thing that I'm actually going to get done today no matter what?
So that's how I start my day when I'm being super Alex and not not basic.
12:51
Alex.
And so hopefully you guys found that useful for you guys to start your days, just the right way.
So lots of love have a tactical Tuesday, turnout, Tuesday, get stuff.

So lots of love have a tactical Tuesday, turnout, Tuesday, get stuff.
Done Tuesday, lots of love.
Get you guys soon.
Bye.0:00
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
0:18
What is going on, everyone?
Hope you guys are having a thankful Thursday, full of thoughtful things for your People that starts with th anyways.
I wanted to break this down because I just came off a full day yesterday of having our top 10 for she's Labs sellers out to Austin, which was an awesome full day.
0:40
We got to share best practices on the selling side and on the gym owner side which was super, super cool.
So tons and tons of nuggets that I will be dropping for a legacy group tomorrow based on some of the findings there, but one of the conversations that came up during During the full day was how to basically reverse engineer goals to a freakish amount of precision.
1:03
And so, if you're, if you've been involved in our community at all, a lot of, what's up saying, a lot of people in my, in my, in my community.
And then who work at, Jim lunch, with say, and I'm just seeing what they tell me is that Alex is back of a napkin math is ridiculous.
1:21
Very, very accurate.
And so I make Decently for our predictions.
Six months, nine months away.
Have how many people are going to have how much were ever going to have what we're going to need to sustain the growth of we want to hit and usually those things are very very accurate within pretty small margin of error.
1:39
And so what I want to share with you is the process of doing this and of course this is going to be really tactical and like really physically help your business.
So it'll be less.
This everything is the type of thing to do like oh man it's gonna require thought.
This isn't going to be like mental masturbation where I can Just like think and feel good.
1:56
This is actually like the real shit that build your business.
So sorry this is going to be run a real ones and I try and make some of the software pieces because I know everyone loves those by.
Like I have more obligations to help you make more money.
So any oh, So, I'm going to give you the numbers that Monica matar came up with yesterday, didn't come up with them.
2:15
Just this is what she approaching, we broke them down for her, then I broke them down for someone else afterwards.
And I was like, you know what, I think it would be good to do a sample of this for everyone here.
So she was she was at 100 EFT, such a hundred recurring members at her gym and she had added 50 FTS the month before.
2:34
So she basically restarted her gym, she a huge emotional issue.
That happened, some some big family issues that went on and said, She basically closed our gym down and started over and was still able to maintain your legs of humans because of how much she had cash.
It stopped.
So anyways she basically from 0 to 100 like two months, that being said and she's a statute said, figure gym owner like she's a piece but she was like how quickly and how should I set my goals for when we should hit what and how long it's going to take, right?
3:02
And so I want to break this down for you because I did it for her in like six minutes and she was like holy shit like and there's a lot of stuff to it but they're really really Trick or so she is a hundred deities.
All right.
She is 100 man.
Seriously. 100 ft, he's great.
3:20
Okay, perfect you guys can see.
Okay, so she's 100 active members.
Now we know that she wants to get to 300.
All right?
So she's trying to get to 300 dft's.
And when she started talking to me, she said I don't think I can handle more than 200 and I was like, well let's do the math and so she could handle 22 people per session, okay?
3:41
And with 45-minute sessions, she could do three hours in the afternoon, three hours morning, it had eight sessions a day, so that would be 176 people per day that she can service and that's what perfect attendance spread across, but that's on Monday, Wednesday, Friday.
3:59
If she's doing Tuesday, Thursday Saturday, then she gets another 176.
That should be an addition sign.
All right, which means your total would be like, 350 ish, right?
So I said, I think 300 is a very easy goal for you to hit because like, your actual Max is significantly high.
4:15
So let's hit 300 as to go.
All right, so that's when the 300 came from.
So, let's go back.
So now she is 300, which means she is a 200 Delta between where she is currently and where she would like to be, right?
So, let's like, let's set a goal for this.
4:30
That seemed reasonable.
Do you think gaining you just did 50 Dft's in a month.
I was like let's just say that we try and gain 20 neck, the next ten months from where you're at now.
Okay.
So that means that she gained 20 Netflix a month.
So get to 300 before the end of you should be there at like November, okay?
4:47
So 20 per month but what does that actually freaking hate this marker?
Okay, what does that actually mean though?
Right?
So everyone's like okay, cool, 20 per month.
I thought this was supposed to be hard myth.
It gets more complicated but it'll get more accurate.
So check that We know she signs up plus 50 per month, right?
5:07
We also know that her attrition is 6%, which means that she loses 6% of her customers month over month.
All right, so the reason I'm going to say this is back of napkin is because it's not going to be perfect, but it's getting really, really close to accurate, and I'm going to show you why.
All right?
So if she's got six percent, attrition that I'm going to take like one of the last month's that she has here.
5:29
Okay?
So let's say when she's at 270 of teas.
All right.
So let's Going to be on the last month's near the end and I'm going to take six percent of that number.
Okay?
.06 and if you have, if you want to know how to do math really fast in your head, just everything is tens fives and ones.
5:45
Okay so if I don't need to know what 6% is.
I'm going to take two seventy to one percent which is moving over which we 2.7 x 6 which means I'm going to have twelve plus four point two, which means it's you me 16.2.
Okay, that's what 6%.
6:01
If you're curious like how to do this in your head.
So 16.2 is what her attrition is going to be on that last month right now.
If we also have to add that 20 ft is of growth, it means that what she actually needs to be setting up is 36 people per month.
6:20
It's a little more work.
I'm getting now, so she has to sign up 6036 EMTs per month, including her attrition.
Now mind you in the beginning.
If she signs up 36 per month, she's actually beginning at a fast rate, which means she might hit this in, like maybe eight.
Runs.
Right.
And I like setting my goals long in achieving the early.
6:36
So I recommend doing this way, now that being said, it also gives a room 24, like a return, fuck up and have something break a long white, which is likely, right?
So let's go back and let's reverse engineer the 36.
So she is 36 gift.
He's right that she needs to sign up monthly and we know.
6:52
So I'm going to start, I'm going to start it at the end so you guys can see everything.
Hopefully you're following along at home.
Okay, so 36 dft's is the back end right now we're going to go backwards this way.
Now, in order for 3060 of teas, we know that she converts 66% of people from her front and program into her continuity.
7:11
Okay.
So if she's doing 36 sorry 66% then that's going to be roughly like 55 people.
I can probably do the actual math.
Let's say 36 divided by phone. 66 Tada 54.5 see head math, pretty good.
7:27
Okay so 55 people are going to be if she's doing to if she's converting 2/3, which is fairly standard for much, the genomics community.
Now, mind you the way that these stats become accurate, if by using the stats that you have, right now, it's not by saying I should be converting 80%.
7:43
Once I do XYZ will be at home, forget about all that, what are you doing now?
And then when you use the stature actually doing now, when you're messing stuff up and you make predictions off of what you're doing right now, what is you'll be amazed to hack your there.
Okay, so 55 people have, so this is EFT.
8:02
This is sign up.
So I miss a front-end signups.
Sign-ups.
All right.
Now, we also know there's another drop off.
She usually drops, 10% of people between sign up and start, okay?
So she's losing 10% of people that it means she's going to be signing up 61 people.
8:20
All right, 10 percent off of that is 55.
Okay is actual sign ups.
All right, now, I'ma say net front inside of here.
All right, she loses 10%.
Between sign up and start cool.
Now this is per month.
8:38
Okay, so I like to get to weekly so that this can become a little bit more tactical.
So let's divide this by 4 instead of 4.3.
And I do that because I like to give myself a little bit of wiggle room so I can do it in four weeks rather than four point three weeks.
I'm still hating my goals.
Okay, just me 15 people per week.
8:55
Fishing used to sign up.
Okay this is getting a little more Tactical.
But what does that mean?
So right now, we know that she converts again.
Two-thirds of people who walk in her door, she's a good salesman.
So, she converts two out of three people walk in here door into a challenge.
9:11
Okay, or a friend and program of her choice, whatever.
Right.
Which means 22 people are going to actually sit down with her.
All right, so that's going to be shows.
Now of the 22 people that sit down with her.
She is a 50% show rate, which means she's going to need 44 people scheduled In order to hit that 22 shows.
9:32
Now right now she does 75% of her leads, get scheduled.
Okay.
So if we've got 75% of so 44 represents 75%, which would be 3/4 so divided by 3 is 15 plus 15 is 60.
9:53
Okay cool.
It's actually 59 but I'm just a 64 minutes.
All right 60 people.
'Well 60 leads.
Okay so now she's got 60 leads that she needs to get per week, all right now How much does it cost her her lie right now?
10:11
Cost her about 12 dollars per lead.
All right, which means she has to be willing to spend for your scheduled. 22 shows 15 closes.
Okay, cool, we're good.
I just want to make sure that I'm not missing you all up 15 times a week. 22 show 44.
10:33
Are scheduled from that the 60 leads.
Okay good.
Now that means that she's A spending. $720.
Yeah, seven hundred twenty dollars per week.
It adds okay yeah, do to do to do.
10:54
That means that per day, she's spending a hundred dollars roughly.
Let's just say 120 roughly per day.
Announce now.
Hey, if you're a return listener and you have not rated or reviewed the show, I want you to know that you should feel absolutely terrible about yourself and everything else in the world kidding.
11:14
But it would mean the absolute world to me.
If you guys would go ahead and do that, you don't have to pause the show, you keep listening and you can just do with your thumb right now.
It'll take you less than 60 seconds.
And like I said, the only way that podcast grows through word of mouth and this is you joining hands with me and helping as many isomers of possibly can because no one is coming to save us, it's just us.
11:30
All right, so please go do that now.
Then let's get back to the shop.
We also know that in order for her to hit 120 to get that, she usually had like only one third of her ads are winners, okay?
So she's spending $10 per day to get this from winners, right?
11:50
/ adsit, that means that she has 12 winning ad sets that are working, which means she created, 36 total assets, To get her number.
Alright, 36, ad sets.
To get 12 winners.
Okay. 12 letters.
12:08
All right.
So in order for her to hit her goal, what she is going to do, right?
Is that if she's doing 15 signups per week and she signed it and she's selling people five days a week.
I mean, she needs three signups a day, which means she needs to sit down with so divided by five about five people a day.
12:29
Alright?
So she sits down with five people a day and it means that per day, if she's getting 60 leads, Per week, she's going to getting something.
Doesn't seem right here.
So this is what happens when you do a lot.
12:46
Something doesn't seem right here, 60 leads, 22, signups, something got lost because I know it would be morally sin us.
Caesar children 49, I guess this is right.
Okay.
So if she's got 60, 60 leads a week, right there, coming in.
13:04
Then we know that she's going to be spending, basically three thousand dollars per month in ads.
Right, what's 120?
So, if you 20 times 3,600, all right?
So 36 hundred dollars a month in advertisements, and that every week, she's going to need to make 36 ads.
13:23
Knowing that two-thirds of those ads are going to work, okay?
And so, if we have to break this down tactically for her, she's going to every single week.
Make 36 hats, which takes time this shit takes time, right?
Four hours, probably, maybe, more for hours and weeks, he's going to be making advertisements.
13:41
All right from there, that is going to generate her. 60 leads per week that she's going to be able to work.
She's gonna get 44 of them, scheduled of the 60, half of those people shows, 22 of this F, that social close 15 per week of those 15 per week that she's scheduling.
13:59
I just switched to monthly here.
The probably getting confusing, but if we're doing it per week, that she's probably going to lose 10% which is one and a half.
So she's gonna have 13 people who start our week of the 13 people, that that actually start, which is this number.
She's going to have two thirds of them.
14:16
Actually finished, which means to me closer like nine people finishing and that's where you do the times for converting and that 2236 EFT switch with attrition gets her to her goal within 10 months.
So if right now you're like, huh, I really want to hit X EFT goal.
14:35
You have to break it all the way down in terms of what you need to do to get there.
So that cut like and for you that's assuming and you have to assume the numbers you have, okay?
Okay, so she has a really good scheduling percentage.
She has a decent show percentage and she is a good sales percentage if you tweak some of these numbers, like let's say she's only scheduling half of these people, then we're looking at like 90 leads and that's just if we went from 75 percent to 50 percent under schedule rate, if her show rate because he did this with someone else was 30%, then all of a sudden this number listed, let's just change to of the numbers to show you how different this can be.
15:11
All right?
So if she can schedule, if she's scheduling fifty percent instead, okay?
She is 90 leads if she then is only having a third show that it means that we have to let's just say 25% format sake so that I don't kill myself.
All right, that means to she needs 190 leads per week right now very quickly that number just tripled by tweaking to the numbers.
15:34
And so you have to use the numbers that are real for your business.
All right?
Right now, like what's actually happening, what you wish is happening, like once we hire this new appointment scheduler, once I get this new salesperson in, We're like not off the one hot day you that you once had and sales but you need to look at how many points that I actually eat last month and how many of them that I actually closed?
15:55
Then how many of them actually started and then use those numbers and you'll be absolutely flabbergasted at how accurate your predictions will be.
And so this is just how you can pay you came to forecast, what you need to do on a daily basis, she needs to have Five people show up which means he needs 10 appointments per day done.
16:16
That's what you need.
She's 10 appointments per day and that's how we know that she's going to hit this goal, right?
That's how this works.
But if you want to forecast, anything take the numbers that you have take, what's real?
And then see what the with the logical.
16:33
Next Step, before that, that needs to happen.
Like, you can even go even close to that.
So, to get those leads, I need x amount of clicks and my funnel is convert like Mi any Pages converting at Beck's and so you can go all the way back.
You can go even further and do this.
I just want to overcomplicate regular but like that, that is how you make predictions.
16:52
And so like when we make back with napkin math predictions, based on like how many support reps, we're going to need an x amount of Revenue and how many applications we need to drive growth that Hit this goal.
This is how we break it down.
It's like, we need this many applications.
If you have this many applications, this many scheduled, this many are showing, this is what we're closing.
17:09
This is what the average sales guys closing per month.
Not what they should be closing both, they're actually closing.
And in order to hit this volume goal, I need this many salespeople at current level, right.
I'm sure if we can improve things, awesome, right?
But the thing is, is your improvements will happen.
What would scale other things will break.
17:25
And so that's why predicting based on current numbers become so accurate because Improvements that you make are going to be to fix broken systems.
And the systems will always be broken.
Because as you were growing things brick, you always need to be constantly re-fixing things because what works to retain a hundred clients is not works to retain 200 or 300, or 500 FPS the systems that you create break and that is part of growth welcome to business.
17:52
So, anyways, hope this was valuable for you, guys.
You can drop a comment or tag someone who's on your team, if you want to be frequency, good.
At predicting things, don't do best case, do current case, and give yourself a little bit of Wiggle to mess up, and then you'll be amazed.
18:09
And your staff would be amazed at how accurate your predictions are and fun math math trick.
So I told you that like, so fun fact for everyone.
Here, I for the longest time and talk about limiting beliefs, I, for most of my life thought I was really bad at math.
18:24
Okay.
That was the thing.
Most people who are in our world would be, like, Alex is really good enough, right?
I do not have all the time.
Dumb.
And it was because one day, I was like, why do I think that?
And I traced it back to like I had I was really good at math and then I had this one freak out teacher, who's horrible?
And I basically just didn't pay attention.
18:40
Ethan.
You're just a horrible, teacher, or maybe I didn't take full responsibility to class because I was 15, like I wasn't, I wasn't at that level of development, but from that point on basically, everything after algebra 2, I had no idea what was going on, right?
So, I thought I was bad at math, but here's how you can do.
18:57
And, like, to be fair.
You really never need calculus in business for most All right, but if you want to know how to do like math really quickly in your head, which I love doing it, like, calculating tips and all that kind of, that kind of stuff is that everything is on tens fives and ones, okay?
19:13
Hopefully I'm just adding bonus value for you guys, okay?
So if I need to take, let's say, 17 percent of 240, okay?
Then what I'm going to think of, in my head is, I've got 240, right?
All right, I've got 240.
I'm going to think what's 10% of that.
19:30
Boom, that's 24, right?
You move the decimal and then what's half of that to get my five?
Alright is 12.
So 15% would be 36, right?
But I have two more percent that I have to take care.
Well, what's one percent 2.4 move, the decimal twice, which means I have to, at 4.8, to my 36, which means 40 Point. 8 is 17 percent, right?
19:51
You can check your calculators, that's what it is.
All right?
And so if you're like, how does a mistake 15% of blah, blah, blah.
It's like, this is how you take the percentages, you do tense, and then you get your five and then you add your ones.
And so you can do this from multiplying standpoint, you can do it from a division like from a from a getting percentage of standpoint but like that's the hack it's like when I have, you know, yeah, whatever 320 and I want 16 percent, right?
20:20
Three hundred and twenty sixteen percent.
So I'm going to go 320 in my head 32 is 10%.
Sent 16% Sony half of that, which is 16, right?
I'm going to add that to its 48th.
And then I got my one percent that I have to add on top of it, which is 3.2 which will take me to 51.2, right, you guys can check it on your calculators.
20:43
So if I'm doing 16%, oops, percent of 320, that's how you do it.
You can do it in your head and everyone's like it's not really it's just tens fives once and so if you To do this for yourself and have a party trigger.
21:00
Just, I think it's really useful because you can get really good guest Emmett's in your head and not constantly have to pull calculator out which kind of slows your momentum down.
So anyways, fun trick for you there, but that is how we make freakishly accurate predictions and you should apply this to your business.
Just logically reverse engineer.
21:15
The goals that you have.
Lots of love, drop a comment down below like have an amazing day, I'll get you soon.
Ah,0:00
What's going on, everybody?
I'm bringing some more books, but I wanted to say that, if you haven't checked out Hunter million-dollar offers, I would definitely suggest that you start there.
I've gotten some solid feedback and it couldn't be happier with its.
Number one ranking on Amazon for direct marketing and over 5,000, five star reviews.
So, thank you guys so much for that.
0:15
It's 164 pages.
I really can help you out.
It takes about four hours to get through, check it out.
On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
The audiobook is Lowe's, they'll let me put it on for it.
So I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast, why your feelings are Killing your finances.
0:30
So um, one of the funds quotes that I love about businesses business is simply mathematical decisions, made within the context of human psychology, which essentially means that you need to do arithmetic and Division and algebra in order to make business decisions and then overlay that on the people that they're going to affect, right?
0:50
And so one of the fun things is that, if you look at really, really high up CEOs, like you look at Elon Musk.
You look at Mark Zuckerberg and you listen or Warren Buffett you listen to them.
Speak right?
They sound like computers like Bill Gates, they sound like like robots, they sound devoid of any human or any human emotion and I think that that's there's there's, there's the nature-nurture part of it, which is that there's some people who are, you know, CEOs who are?
1:17
I don't know if they like sociopaths but like basically have a little bit less human effect than others and they're able to make mathematical decisions, despite some of the emotions that may be around them, which actually make better business sense.
Even though they may be Difficult.
The thing is that once you get up to that level, that billionaire status and I'm not there, but I'm just saying, if you observe the people who are there, it's a very common Trend and I think this is my position.
1:41
Is that the reason that they're able to achieve that is because they're able to make decisions devoid of human emotion.
And so, the human within the context of human psychology, the second part of that sentence.
A lot of times comes into play.
When you're talking about sales and marketing and positioning, because all of that is Skills.
2:00
But when it comes to the business model monetization and then in some depth, in some instances, making the difficult decisions around Personnel.
A lot of times, your emotions are really only things that are going to get in your way.
There are a lot of decisions right now that you may or may not be making, because you have emotional charge around them.
2:20
So, you may have a firing decision or a hiring dislike, somebody who, you know, is not best for that position and it is up to you as the business owner.
Owner to be able to make the decision without the emotion.
And so what happens is and this is something that I've noticed is that I've become less and less reactive as we have gone hyerin up higher and higher up in business because you have to be.
2:46
And if you aren't, then you won't keep moving up.
And so it's like, if you see these people all the way up here and some part of you might say, like, I don't know if I want to be that, and that's fair.
But in order to get all the way up here, you basically in some ways have to become like a row And be able to show up neutral in all situations so that you can't get hot-headed so that you can show up consistently to your team and make decisions that they can have faith in that.
3:12
They are logical that there are based on math.
They are based on reason and not based on like swings of emotion of feeling like we're doing great.
Don't know we suck because the reality is that usually it's in the middle, nothing in.
This is just like one of the like I was going to make this thing for my birthday and they decided not to but one of the lessons that I've learned has been that nothing is ever as good as you think it's going to be or as bad as you think it's going to be the only things that are above those things, are things that you don't think about.
3:38
So the only things that will be worse than you ever imagined or things that you didn't expect to come anything that like nothing is going to be better than you imagined.
Except for things that you didn't expect to have happen, right?
I did not expect you want to take off the way that it did because the original model that we had was not the model that we switch to and we have.
3:55
Now this model I did not have a huge anticipation for because I was actually getting out of the business.
When I made the decision to switch into a done with you model instead of a done-for-you model and that's when everything took off.
And so it's the things that we don't expect, often times that that do the things that are beyond that.
4:10
And the reason I'm saying this is because we have so much emotion that's charged on the future, charger on our anxieties, or our, or a hopes.
And a lot of times that impairs our ability to function today.
And a lot of times, whether it's good or bad, how you show up to the team in a positive way, or - what like, if you're somebody who's like really cold or really hot like if you're like Always going to be positive like that.
4:31
Also is not good because it just shows that you're not stable.
And so, the goal am I believe, and what I observe at people who are doing much better than me, is that I talk about it all the time that it's quiet, they keep their surroundings quiet, they always show up the same.
That's why consistency is so key.
4:48
So that you have these routines in place that you can show up the same every single day independent of the circumstances around you so that you can make the decisions using the same Frameworks and using logic and not Feelings.
And so one of the goals that Leila always has is as a leader and she puts this post it on her on her computer is be neutral.
5:09
And so it's the reason it's so hard is that the middle path is so difficult, right?
It's the dichotomy of leadership, like, you want to be really high when it's high and you want to be really low in its low and entrepreneurs by Nature tend to be more emotional.
That's what creates the creative spark.
5:25
That's creates the desire to innovate.
It's what is the initial thing that It allows you to get that emotion going to take the risk, to leave your job to start the business to do all these things.
And then the moment you start it, you have to be the opposite of who you are in order to succeed and so it's very counterintuitive that you're like, wait, I have to be devoid of emotion.
5:45
And so what happens is you have to start these things with practice.
It's like well how do I do that?
How to make emotions without feelings?
And the best way, at least in my experience is to always break it down to math, right?
Is to break it down of math and Put as many decisions as I can through data and actually extrapolate out what this decision means data wise.
6:07
And so a lot of times if you're look at okay, how much it will?
It cost me to keep someone in a position that they are not suited for?
And then I start bringing them?
Okay.
Well, I have the cost that I'm actually paying them.
That's the hard cost, right?
And then I have the soft cost of the job that they're actually not doing.
6:25
So it's like there's money that's going out for them, right?
And then there's the value that they're not added, which is actually a double burn.
And then if there's someone who's in leadership, then it's all of the downstream effects of the decreased effectiveness of the entire team and then you have the hard costs for those members and so you can see how these things extrapolate out.
6:44
And so breaking it down to the numbers like that, sometimes can give you the confidence to make the decisions that sometimes are difficult to make.
And I think that what happens over time is that you just get used to it.
Real quick guys.
7:01
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
7:20
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
And so, your skin gets thicker and a lot of times, if you look at some of these interviews, like I was referencing, if you, if you watch these CEOs, the super high level entrepreneurs, the very deliberate with how they speak, and what they say, because they've done it so many times, it becomes second nature and it's difficult to develop that type of thick skin.
7:53
Without going through the fire pit and The Gauntlet of having you know, employees that you loved start, you know, claiming that you were a racist and trying to sue you and having it, you know I've been like I love everybody.
8:09
I'm an equal-opportunity everything.
Okay, but I'm saying that these things happen to you Elon Musk was on a podcast the other day.
He's like, he has like 25 lawsuits ongoing any time like, people suing him because the car didn't drive them to work every day.
8:24
Like ridiculous things because he's elevated to that position.
And if you cannot quiet your emotions, there's no way that you're going to be able to move the next level.
And so, it does require this sort of deadening of your Reactions.
And so it's, that's that's my current chapter that I'm on right now, of this little entrepreneurship journey is, is is looking at all the things that create emotion, in my life, both positive and negative, and seeing how it affects me and how I show up on a daily basis.
8:55
And then more importantly, how it affects the decisions that I'm able to make with Clarity.
And so, my, urging to you is right now, there probably are some decisions that you are not making because their emotions I'm recharged.
And what you need to do is look at it within the context of math and say, does this make sense and do it?
9:14
Like and you have to make the hard choice in a lot of times the hard choice is not the popular.
It's not the one that makes you everyone's best friend, but the thing is, is that it will either be you, who makes her choice to in the moment today or the hard choice will be made for you by the marketplace because your business will not work.
9:33
And so it's a constant like I feel like life a lot of times, man.
This is big.
Statement.
But life, a lot of times is sacrificing your short term comfort for your long-term benefit.
And so, when it comes to Fitness sacrificing, your short term, comfort of eating.
What you want to eat for a long term benefit sleep for sacrificing.
9:52
Your short-term, benefit of, like, why would I watch one more episode?
I want to save a little bit later.
I want to pop, I want to waste time on my phone rather than going to sleep, right?
But the long-term benefit is clear.
I want to keep this person on because maybe they'll turn around, but they probably won't.
You already know that if you had to bet on it you probably wouldn't be.
10:07
No, right.
I'm just using that.
As an example, there's a million other things that you have to do something with clients.
If you have a client who just consistently grinning your attention, just get them out, you know what I mean?
But it's hard.
And the reason it's hard is the reason that mouth is why most people don't succeed.
10:25
That's it.
So like the advanced people don't do anything Advanced, they just never don't do the basics.
And so like this is something that I'm continuing to go back to at least in the season that we're in entrepreneurially.
Is that it's consistently.
Revisiting the basics of like how can I do the basics better rather than how can I find Advanced things?
10:44
And I think that a lot of us, you know, and I say this a lot but like We need to be reminded more than we need to be taught.
Like if you've ever like Bruce Lee said, I don't fear man, who's done a thousand kicks one time, but the man has done one kick a thousand times, right?
11:00
Like we get better by doing the same things over and over again and that's like and it's boring and that's what makes it hard and that's why most people don't succeed is that they want something that's fun and exciting because that's what entrepreneurs want.
But business requires consistency.
11:18
And the business requires you to be everything that you weren't born to be.
And that is why most people don't make it.
So just food for thought, if you have some things that you need to do just do them take out, take the math out, look at it from Pure numbers and make the decision as though, it were someone else's company and then you'll be surprised at how how easy and how clear some of those decisions can be one other context.
11:44
Our frame that I like to make some decisions on is if Significantly smarter than myself.
What would I tell myself to do and or if I were the smartest, man in the world, what would that guy do?
And if you think about things, I know it's silly but a lot of times you think that guy would be a super genius and he would look at it purely like this dollars and cents.
12:04
And then you'd be amazed at the quality of the decisions that come out of that type of thought process.
So, anyways, I will catch you guys on the flip side.
Sorry, for the long delay.
I've got some amazing stuff.
I will talk about from the Arnold this weekend from the charity event that we sponsored.
Super cool and I will go into cool details on the giving stuff and lots of stuff that we did from there.
12:23
Lots of celebrities, we got to meet in person and so I will update you on that soon.
An amazing day and if you could throw a like or comment anyways, talk to you soon.









0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
Good morning, everyone and welcome.
Welcome to today's episode of how to not get butthurt, about your competitors, copying your stuff.
So I'm actually super pumped for this one that's why I said coming in hot, I had a message last night from a gym owner who is is in our program and he was like dude, these guys are using all your copy, they're using all your sales stuff and they're claiming credit for it.
0:53
There's like they're not even giving you any credit, right?
And I just, I just, I can't, I can't even express to you, the apathy that I had in response to the to the message that I got.
And it's and that's something that has taken me a long time to build.
1:10
And to get to the point where, like, I actually don't get upset about this stuff anymore at all, and which means that I get, I have now able to like keep 100% of my attention.
And I want to show you exactly how I got there.
Because when I started with my Jim's, I would get so upset.
1:27
About people using my copy people copying my landing pages.
People using my ads people stealing our meal plans and then like I see our meal plan down with the guy down the street people, you know, shopping us and like seeing what we're doing for our programs and then like modeling it on their side, like I used to get so upset about this stuff.
1:45
Like I would lose sleep over, right.
And the reality is, You don't matter.
It doesn't matter.
The ideas are not yours typically because anytime, I think I have an original idea.
2:00
You can probably find someone before you who has thought of it, right?
And like the the ideas for the sales and marketing and all the stuff that we have.
Like, I learned things, you know?
I mean like I read Dan Kennedy I I read all Russell stuff.
2:15
I read, you know, I mean like you know a zillion books on sales I'm ready, you know, Jordan Belfort.
Stuff through cardones training.
Like you don't even like, there's so many influences on what create anything that to like say like this is all mine.
It's like, dude, nothing is yours, nothing's anyone.
2:31
So you know, and so to get super butthurt about it is just like it's just not worth the time.
And a fun thing to note is that it has literally never affected our bottom line.
We have literally, never made less money because people are copying Us.
In fact, the more people copied us the more money we made.
2:50
Multiple reasons, one because the more people who are copying you it means that you're actually good, right?
It means that you have something that is worthy of copying.
If people are not copying, you should be worried because you're not good, right?
Like, that's it, right?
Like apple made the iPhone and then Samsung made the Galaxy Tab, like copying is competition.
3:12
And so, that's why speed Innovation matter so much is because you have to stay ahead.
It means that you can never rest on your laurels.
You ask you, Continue to crush it and improve and improve and improve and like like 30 years ago, people used to, you might remember this when you would go buy something at the store your dad or your mom would open it up and check it to make sure that it wasn't broken because getting something from the store that was not broken.
3:37
Was considered a win nowadays.
If you got something from the store that was broken, you would be like, up in arms about how upset you were about this.
That's because manufacturing is improved, and it's because like competition continues to get fair.
Share in fiercer.
Because we need to innovate as business owner.
So if you think you're going to make something that people aren't going to copy you, then, like you just don't live in reality, right?
3:59
And what's comforting to me is to know that if someone copies me right?
Like, we don't really copy, I'll just be straight with you because like, we're busy like making shit, right?
But if someone is copying me, in my mind, they don't have the skills to win, right?
4:18
They don't have the skills to win.
Because they don't know how to innovate, right?
And so like they will always be behind.
So it doesn't really matter.
And the reality is that right now, I don't think our team could even take the more growth than we already have going on in the business, right?
4:35
The bottleneck is me, the bottleneck is our infrastructure, the bottleneck is, how many people we have to service customers?
That's the bottleneck.
Like, if all of a sudden every single person's clients of every copy cat that I had came to us, you'll probably crush us, you know what I mean?
And so, So like the reality is like, we are always the bottleneck to our business, some competitors, not stealing your business.
4:57
The reason your business is where it is because you have other bottlenecks in your business, not around your business, but in your business that are causing your business to not grow the way you want to or whatever, right?
So like, it just It's like, we don't matter.
You know what I mean and like on?
5:13
So, weird level I'm happy about the fact that at least these fake gurus, and Mama's basement gurus, who are taking our stuff at least, their clients are getting something now.
You know what I mean?
Like, I actually feel weirdly.
Okay.
Oddly about the fact that I'm like, at least these guys are getting something that works.
5:32
I mean it's definitely our outdated shit, you know what I mean?
But like at least it's at least it's better than what they were getting before which is Fluffy.
And are and so on some level like it depends on what your mission is.
You don't even if you're like, I really want to make everyone healthy which hopefully is right.
Like, if some guy down the street is using like your stuff and like people get healthier great, he's not the limit to your business.
5:55
Anyways, the reason your business is where it is, is because your leadership isn't you know where it needs to be?
You're not good at managing details, you're not good at being consistent, you know?
I mean like those are the things that are actually to make your business grow and be consistent.
You can send me profitable, right?
It's not whether he has Boot camp here.
I mean that has a same structure as you or he's using your meal plans or shit, even if he's using your copy.
6:14
It doesn't matter, right?
It's whether you're persons working the leads or they're closing the sales like you don't matter in this equation.
You guys love that you're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
6:32
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, And so, you know, the next thing that always comes up as we were like, you know, like you should sue those guys, right?
6:50
Like I have sued someone, it took a year and it cost like it costs money which I don't like that, didn't really matter.
But it costs so much time and attention that I was like this is just not worth it.
7:06
If I took all of the time and attention for how much I make per hour with the time and attention that I have.
Now that I could invest in the business, I will make a higher return on my time and also, just not have this huge - cloud in my life, you know what I mean?
And so for everyone's like, well, I'm going to Lawyers involved, like if you want your life to be about lawyers said by all means.
7:27
Go for it.
You know what I mean?
Like we have an entire Law Firm.
They do all of our compliance stuff and when we need the lawyers we you know, call the lawyers and then they start attacking people, you know what I mean?
Like we do that but like I'm telling you for most people who are on here, it is just going to destroy your life and take up all of your attention and I guarantee you your business will be worse off, nine times out of 10 for me doing this, you're not going to win some major lawsuit, you don't.
7:50
I mean like and if you do that, it's like, you're going to have to spend.
Spend all your money and all your resources to do that for a long period of time, which feature Jim is probably gonna die.
You don't even like.
So like the big points here is that, if someone copies you great, it means your shit is good.
Actually congratulations.
8:05
Second everyone is going to copy you because that is competition.
If you're actually good third, it means that speed and Innovation are King.
Speed is currency.
That's why speed matters.
Right?
Like how like, here's a fun.
Here's a fun one to think about.
It has taken these guys, the ones who are now our Copycats right to f'ing years, to finally copy.
8:27
I'm like, what took you so long?
Like what have you been doing?
You know what I mean?
Like, having an inferior product for two years, getting your chit stopped in by someone who's new, you know what I mean?
Like like what have you been doing?
You don't mean sitting on your ass.
It's just like, it's so like like I know how long it takes them to do stuff.
8:47
They didn't even have to innovate it and took it to two years to copy whatever.
What I mean, like, okay.
Next like They're copying does not affect your business, you affect your business, the bottleneck is you is not then.
9:04
I have literally never made less money because of someone else copying our stuff.
And it is always when we were making the most money that people copy our stuff because it is actually good, right?
You know what I mean?
And so like and and the ramification of all this stuff is, what are you gonna do, right?
9:20
What are your options there?
There's two options, you can either.
Continue to play the game and realize that anyone who copies you is inherently second because they are copying you which means you are the leader which is where you want to be, right?
9:37
And so you can either do and continue to do the things that have made.
You the leader which is continue to execute, continue to coach your team continue to have speed continue to make things better, right?
That's what you can do as the leader because that's what you're supposed to do or You can stop all of that positive activity of growth and Improvement and give up your lead.
10:00
By putting all of your attention on suing someone.
Right?
And you're going to see one guy, you know, me.
Other people copy your stuff and the reality is like if you're the biggest player are you want to be the biggest Pioneer space?
Like you need to focus on the market, not your competition, you can have an eye on the competition to see if there's anything that you're like, majorly missing, you know what I mean?
10:26
But like, you should not be looking at their stuff, you should not be wasting your time.
You should not be wasting your attention on that.
And so this took me like a really long time to get.
And so I'm passionate about it because I used to lose so much sleep, sleep about this stuff.
When I have my gems, I used to, I used to get so upset about this stuff.
10:45
And it just does not matter at all at all.
And so any oh I hope.
I hope there's somebody here.
Who is, who's not going to lose sleep?
Now because of this stuff, if you see yet another copycat we get you know our customer service team gets two of boxes a week from somebody who's news claiming that they've reinvented the wheel and you know what happens?
11:10
They disappear, they disappear, they disappeared, two months later we never heard from him again.
What I mean?
Like it's just if you don't have the skills to create, then when you copy don't have the skills to win, it just is what it is and they're just be thankful for that, right?
11:28
So anyways guys, keep you drop a like and a comment or throw this for your ops manager or anyone who's like you has worried you about still copying thing.
Like it does not matter.
We are not special snowflakes.
Someone is probably thought of this idea before us we are all influenced by the things that we have learned throughout our lives and It does not affect your bottom line, only you.
11:48
So have an amazing day.
Keep crushing it.
And Jim Lord's.
I'll see you guys in a few hours.









0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
What's going on everyone?
And so I wanted to make this for you because it came up in a conversation that came up Earlier today, and who's going to be?
I was going to make this about two things, but as I'm thinking about, I think I'm just going to make it about one which is the one of the biggest regrets that I have from the years of owning a gym.
0:39
So a lot of people have popularized the lower, you know, what I mean of sales or on some of the stuff that we've done that over 4,000, closes Fitness sales.
And so, one of the biggest regrets that I have is that I have done that and I did nothing to record it.
0:59
I didn't Thing, I've nothing to show for it and so my biggest asked for you right now today that you should start doing at your gym is record everything.
And the reason for that is is because if you think about like an NFL team, right, like what do they do?
They look at game footage, right?
1:15
They look at how they did last week and try and get better this week and so we're trying to improve our businesses except we have no Baseline.
We have nothing that we're working off of and so as you as you grow in your business, like you should have recordings of How you greet customers, right?
1:32
How are you training sessions?
How you conduct sales, right?
And you shave recordings for each of these things, so that you can always look at that and point to it and point to your staff in your team and be like, that's this is what ideal scene looks like.
This is what it should look like.
And this is what you're missing and if they mess up your like go back to the game film, go back to the footage and re-watch it, right?
1:53
Until you can do it in your sleep.
And so what happens is it allows you to standardize your processes in a real way that A lot of people like people learn differently, right?
And so, for selling, the best selling training that I have seen is when you actually and that works.
2:10
Best with phone sales is when you can actually take a recording of view yourself, you can put your phone on speaker and then you have the script in front of you and you highlight what portions of the scriptures saying.
As you're closing, someone over the phone and the same thing would work.
2:25
If you're setting appointments, or if you're, if you're setting for a for a high ticket.
Sale, where you going to ask for money over the phone?
All of those things that works really well for if you want to be a little bit more tacky than what you can do is do a split screen where you pull up the checklist of what's happening.
2:42
And then you have the live actual footage of an orientation of a someone walking in and getting greeted and sat down before the consultation that they're going to have for sales.
And then you have the checklist right next to it.
And you can highlight those things as you're going through it.
2:58
So that somebody who's new into your Company right on your team, can know exactly what's happening and so they can see it in real time.
And so it basically makes the words on the page, the words on the checklist real for them and so it's like one of the biggest hacks for scaling a company and making things consistent is actually documenting what it looks like right.
3:18
And so I was going to have a second part of this which is just about documenting tracking numbers which are probably due for another time but just from a soft skill standpoint, the biggest regret that I have.
I've sold so many freaking Fitness.
Owls that I don't have any of them recorded, which is why I'm such as Zealot and a Nazi about it with this company.
3:35
And I feel like all of this effort that I had that I put into training, my team's you are, listen, it's gone.
I have nothing to show for it.
Hey guys, real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans, I love you.
3:51
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 dollar leads but you will have Have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads its hope free in exchange for email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller leads and so that you can not miss out on it because last time I sold out for like eight straight weeks really fast.
4:17
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
And so do not make my mistake record, everything record out like in the best ones are recording live things, like it's cool to record yourself when you're telling someone in theory, but it's so much more valuable to see it in action with the checklist with the ideal seen next to them.
4:38
So it becomes real for them.
So that is my little tidbit for Sunday's, this is an easy one.
You can start doing, set up, set up a camera somewhere in your facility, so you can see onboarding stuff.
And so You can see I mean, some of you guys already have security footage but you can also make up the area and then all you have to do is if you want to be compliant about it, just have to make sure that you fog out the person's face, you protect your identity and what not?
5:03
Or you can just ask them.
Hey, you mind if we use this for training because you had such an amazing experience, you know, we'd love to share it, something like that.
And then that way and when you can cut these things together because it is really really really not difficult.
Like you can Google like iTunes video your immunity and watch a 10 minute trailer on how Just like, cut out pieces so you can condense them together and in an hour, you can show someone 15, you know, clients walking in the door and what it looks like.
5:31
If you think about like NFL game footage, they don't have the time between, while everyone's regathering, it's just like, boom.
The play starts, it's just whistle to whistle, right?
Whistle to whistle whistle to whistle.
And so you do the same thing with your sales.
You do the same thing with your orientation through the same thing with how you greet people every day for the session of what an ideal start to accession should look like.
5:50
And you'll be amazed at how How much more quickly you can get things consistent at your facility.
So one story to bring this home, one of our neighbors here, she's our, they're both doctors and and really nice people and she gets she's super into fitness.
And so she goes to like three different gyms, right?
6:07
And they're all like our style, you know what I mean?
$200, a month type facilities and one of the ones who goes through his orange theory and so we were over there just for like a snack or something I wrote why were there.
But anyways, we walked over and said, hey, and Like yeah, I just I'm about to cancel my orange there and I was like, huh?
6:24
What?
Like what made you do that?
And she's like, I love the workouts, I love the trainer's, I love the vibe, everything's right?
And I was like, then why are you canceling?
And she's like, you know, the front desk girls, just a little, you know, every time I walk in, she's just just not super nice.
Just a little little standoffish and I thought to myself immediately man, there are some business owner right now who's Kurt, like turning over in his voice.
6:46
He's not, he's not dead yet, but if he were to have, you be turning over in his grave, but like it's just banging his head.
To the keyboard because he's like, God, because people value consistency and you would be amazed at the things that a normal consumer will stop going to will stop frequency a business for, right?
7:02
And it's like the devil's in the details, it's just that the best business is always do the basics and that's what makes them Advanced.
It's that they always do the basics, right?
You teach someone how to squat and then you go back to zero and then they get better better better and you go back to zero and you teach them more and more refinement on the same idea.
7:19
It's not like you're you teach them 20 different versions of something.
A lot of times Mastery comes from doing the fundamentals, the best way.
And it's Bruce.
Lee said, I fear the man who's done one kick a thousand times, not a thousand kicks once.
So with that have an amazing day record, all your stuff, make sure you document it.
7:36
Put it against what ideal scene looks like in a check mark and then you can always update these trainings if you get better and you processes.
But these are the things that actually build a business that becomes a valuable asset.
That if you did want to sell it.
One day you're like, listen, we've already documented every one of these systems.
It's already are tight.
Right and then when you bring people on, it takes you way less time to get them on board and which allows you to scale faster and when someone does not do something, you can hold them to it and say see you miss this and this and this you want you messed up here like it's okay like let's improve.
8:06
Go watch the videos again, you know what I mean?
And it just gives you an easy way rather than you having to sit down for another 30 minutes and saying it.
So I wasted so much time and I wish I wish I wish I had recorded all these things from our facilities that I do not have.
So please don't make the mistake.









0:00
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into.
0:16
And if not keep enjoying the show, oh my God, I just spent 18 minutes rocking.
Some content.
And for some reason, my microphone was on mute.
So I'm going to do my best to actually do this again because I'm still in state for this.
0:33
And so I'm calling this how much ignorance techs are you paid?
And so one of the biggest cost of life is ignorance tax.
And so I got this concept from Myron, golden who when when I first heard this he was finishing up a couple days.
0:53
You know, presentation, he was closing right and he wrote, he asked somebody in the audience and was like, how much, how much do you make sir?
And he was like, I make 50 Grand.
He's like, okay, cool.
He's like, did you know that you have paid life 950 thousand dollars every single year of your life?
1:14
Because you do not know how to make a million dollars, right?
You do not possess that skill and so that was like, and that was one of the closest that he had for the audience, right?
Yeah, I'm doing it again, Terry.
I'm going all in like yes, Mike did not work and I'm just going to rip and Roar because that's what life is not.
1:30
So anyways, so Myron golden, he pitches this and he says you paid like nine hundred fifty thousand dollars for every year that you did not know how to make a million dollars.
Right?
And that hit me so hard because I think there's so many deeper roots to that concept.
And so this piece of content has been coagulating in my mind for a long time and and it just like it's and it culminated that it's perfect because like my freakin microphone didn't work for the first. 18 minutes of this rant, and I'm just going to start back in the tub, do it again, but one of the things that drives me absolutely Bonkers right is is when I see like in our group and our Legacy group of high school gym owners, I see someone reading a book, right?
2:10
It's like I'm reading how to never lose a customer again, right?
And it drives me nuts because I can almost guarantee that that person has not consume the content about our retention system, right?
Which every single gem that has ever implemented has cut their turn from whatever it's at 2 under 4 percent within a 12 week period, right?
2:30
And so we're trying to reinvent the wheel here when the wheel has already been made, right?
And so, when I see, like how much ignorance acts are you paying, it's one of those things that, like, Like if you have the information in front of you, not learning is just is choosing not to learn with information.
2:49
Sort of use the same as be unable to learn right as being learning disabled, right?
And so like ignorance is the most expensive cost that you have in your life.
Like right now, I'm I do everything in my power to desperately pay down the ignorance tax.
Right?
3:05
And so part of this is also come from the space of like I get people all the time.
Especially 204 asking like what should I do with my money, right?
They're like, what should I be investing in?
And like, it's been something that I've traveled a long time with because I'm like, I don't know what I would be investing in because, like, for us right now.
And I like the answer that I'm using, is not something that's relevant to everyone else.
3:22
Because like, I take 100% of the money after we got what we needed to be good after I took that out all the money that I have goes right back into the business because the business is growing at four hundred percent per year.
So why would I why would I not just invest in that like what stock is going to give me that return nothing and I understand this Market rather than taking profit out putting it to Market, I don't understand.
3:41
Getting 10% per year.
Maybe right.
Maybe over a 20-year period.
I don't like I don't want to play that game right after thinking about it a lot and a lot I was like What I would be investing in is knowledge, right?
It's the skill set that you don't have because, like 100% of the of the knowledge that I have now is has been acquired by, going out and buying stuff.
4:04
And so specifically, people asked me like how much then what books are you reading?
And I thought more about that, like, I don't need them any books.
I really don't I buy courses and I'd go through that.
Like, that's what I spend my money.
I go through courses and I go through them and I acquire a skill, right?
And like for Me like reading a book about the one thing.
4:22
Let me summarize it for you.
It's about doing one thing, right?
Like, let me save you, two hours, your life, right?
And so, like, I see something isomers, get that strap of like, wanting to feel like they're growing wanting to feel like they're making progress.
But then they read brain, candy, mental masturbation books, that they can find in the airport, right?
4:38
Like if you can find it Barnes and Nobles, it's probably too General to actually get you an Roi on your life because what has to happen in order for you to make money and actually start paying down your ignorance, text is you have to take the information I'm assuming you.
Let's just say that, right?
You're a TD just kick in.
4:53
So let's say you consume the book, someone say right?
And then you're going to take that one thing book and you're going to make a concept of how you think you should apply in your business.
So you're going to have a little bit of transposition.
Here you go to take a general concept and apply to something specific.
Then you have to consistently apply that thing to the business that is not necessarily related to the book, and you have to do that over consistent basis.
5:14
And then see, if you had any measurable increase, that has happened in an untested execution of, A concept, right?
And the reality is that, that that's probably not going to happen, right?
Then if you actually did step, all those steps, and then consistently apply for 12 weeks, right?
5:31
It could still not work because it might not be like you consistently tried a theory, right?
And so if you for some reason, have all of the information that is in front of you and you have not applied, it executed and going through it, shame on you.
There's no point.
And so this is me that was me just speaking to my legacy Jim's, right?
5:48
Like, if you're trying to read a book on retention and you have Don't be retention system.
That's like, what are you doing?
You don't even like, stop.
Like just do that.
Like just do that.
And then do it for 12 weeks.
And then and only, then, can you that you have my permission to go and pick up another book like for for your foot, for, increasing, retention whatnot.
6:09
And so like Rob group was over here and he was, he's one of our top Jim's.
He he sold a hundred thousand dollars in just physical product in the last quarter.
Just it is Jim Wright.
Just bolting on to his existing process and he was like yeah man, I ate like three octaves Euros a day.
6:27
I promise is pointless now.
It's like dang dude.
I was like that's expensive and he was like Hey man, food is a non-negotiable.
He's like for me I've got food and knowledge and I just like and that hit me because I was like, man that's like exactly how I live for a long period of time and I don't see that for most people and that's why Rob is one of our top gyms.
6:47
And he will probably always be successful in life because he seeks knowledge, right?
And so the answer to like what do you do to pay down your ignorance checks?
Right like You should take almost all the money that you have right after you have your base level of security right now.
Don't be stupid, right?
7:03
But after your base level security, you take that money and you should buy the adjacent skill set to what you have.
And so this video goes with the town stacking video.
This is the second half, but I like Tom said, you're probably the favorite video that I made a really long time about how to become more value, right?
7:18
Like you have one talent and then you have the second talent and when you have two towns to put together, both become more valuable, you're good at math, kind of useful, okay?
Now you've learned bookkeeping Being makes math more useful, right?
Looking looking better with math math, a bit of with bookkeeper.
Now you have more value, then you become an accountant, third skill, okay?
7:36
Now that's even more valuable than you learn tax law.
Whoo, now you're somebody who can actually provide massive amounts of value, a business, you become more valuable.
So what do you do to pay down your ignorance text?
You learn adjacent skills which means you take the money that you have and you pay down your ignorance tracks by learning what you don't know.
7:54
Hey Mose addition quick break just to let you know, we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright.
So send me a connection request a note.
Let me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or Layla's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
8:10
All right, so let's get back to the show.
Right until like right now the big breakthrough that I've had in our business and this happened very recently was I realize like a nice and I like I grovel trying to figure out what's the next skill that I need to learn.
Right.
8:26
And a lot of times as you get as you get higher up in this is just an interfering with you like a lot of times it's not a skill debt.
That you need to acquire but it's learning how to transfer skill that you have, which is a skill and of itself.
It's teaching a skill, right?
And so like I know how to teach say, I know how to sell, I know how to teach sales, right?
8:44
Her teach how to manage sales team like I know all those things.
I did it right.
But I have never ran a marketing department, I've never done it.
And so I've realized now that the big deficit that I have is that I have not taught how to Market I've taught, I'm given copy paste stuff like You do this, then this then this but I have not taught how to think through that process so that you could innovate how to Market without me.
9:11
Right now.
That's been the deficit that identified.
This is like very recently and so all of my attention for building up our team is that and Soju Motors just heads up all our Legacy guys like all the head.
I'm gonna be basically sharing with you everything that I know and absolute theoretical level so that you can execute this stuff on your own so you guys can innovate this stuff not necessarily have to model ours.
9:32
But like understand the thought process behind each of these things.
And like how like why do we choose these two images.
Right, like why do we choose these two headlights?
Why do we choose?
What's the sub hook?
Like what do we, what are we looking for?
They're like, what are the components that were actually always trying to weave in?
Like why do we structure the funnels explain what colors do we use it?
9:50
We're like all of those things.
Like do we compress the image files to increase the load times as we do little tricks, right?
These are all these things that I know how to do that.
I haven't told anyone about because I haven't thought to do that, right?
And so, So that's been my ignorance sex.
And so just as a, just as a thought experiment for you, if you were to lose everything, you have right now, right?
10:10
Everything you have.
How quickly would you be able to get back to where you're at right now?
Pretty fast, right?
You be able to get there pretty fast, okay?
So imagine if you lost everything and you could get to a level 100 times or 10 times as high as you're at right now pretty fast.
10:31
What's the difference?
You just have more skills, right?
That's it.
It's the only difference, Elon Musk lost everything boom.
Back to billionaire.
Like three years later because he has the skill set to do that, right?
And so like I this is and this may be a flaw.
10:48
So maybe I'll look back on this 20 years from now be like that was a dumb video.
But like, for me at this current juncture in life.
I'm, I spend every dollar I possibly can on acquiring information every dollar I can, and what happens is if you only only Only reinvest in that way.
It eventually will start cash flow into a point where you can't.
11:06
You can't, you can't spend money on information because the amount of money that is coming in is greater than your amount of time to consume the information that you could potentially buy.
That makes sense, right?
Like if you're like well I've got about a thousand dollars a month, I could spend on information, cool thousand dollars a month Like You, by course everyone's and concern, right?
11:23
But like if you start executing the things in that course, and then you start making like an extra, five grand a month or 10 grand a month, that's just for your information, all of a sudden that starts to get harder.
All right, start making 100,000 one lecture, you're like, man, how many like I do our if I could consume all the courses and like that, in my opinion is how you invest, right?
11:41
You invest to pay down your ignorance tax, you invest to become a billionaire.
And the way to become a billionaire, is to learn all the things that need to do to be a billionaire, which is removing all the limiting skills that you don't have to get there.
And so like that's that's how that's how we live, right?
Like I didn't I didn't have a ton of savings, my whole life met tons of Revenue but I invested everything I'm going to learning joining more verbs and like if I would have, if I'm going to think back in time, I think the two most valuable things that I've done in terms of spending money on information, I don't think, I don't think I got a lot from from events person.
12:17
I got a lot from networking, specifically, which I think is just as valuable, I like masterminds.
I think that's like, I think those types of groups where you have people who are similar to you, similar level, and above is where I got the Highest Roi the other really high Roi is when I bought courses, so courses on how to acquire a certain skill.
12:39
And one of the things is is that you should go into that because like if you buy a course on traffic, hopefully you've gone through the town, the second video.
If you have it after this one, watch the town s.
But like, if you buy just a traffic course, you won't necessarily make more money unless that was literally the last link in the chain for you, right?
12:55
It just might be one more link that gets you closer to connecting the thing that's going to be able to allow you to pull money.
Right?
But unless that's the missing link is just going to be one more chain thing, one more skill that you stack adjacent until eventually you'll get the last one or two and then everything takes off, right?
13:13
And so like that is what I would spend my money on because that is what I got the highest Roi on.
If you want to pay down your ignorance tax, the the millions and billions of dollars that all of us are paying life right now for not knowing how to make millions and billions of dollars.
That is where I would put them.
13:30
That is where we continue to put our Honey, I don't even know if I said in this video or the first one right didn't have my freaking audio on but like I think I've spent upwards of 700 thousand dollars.
I was adding it up with him on just extra stuff.
Alright anyways so the seven hundred thousand dollars that I like that I spent like that's a ton of money.
13:50
Some people might say you know what man if you invested that in the marketplace like maybe but now we have way more than that because we took that money and got a huge Roi on it, based on what we were able to.
Now me from And now we can, you know, use that to make a little more.
And so that's that's that's my, that's my that's my two cents.
14:09
That's my, that's my thing that's been on my mind up to this point is like don't try and reinvent the wheel.
If you have information that's in front of you, this relevant to your business, do that first.
Don't try and re brain candy from Barnes & Nobles about like the one thing or like I don't know the last dinner really book on like positive psychology, like, whatever.
14:29
Like it, predictably irrational, Cool.
You know what I mean?
Like, great that's great.
Fun mind kidding, right?
But like just use the stuff that's relevant to your business.
Once you have acute executed, everything that you have in that space, then maybe start going out but I would still then go to acquire skills, not fun like brain candy Books, Okay?
14:49
Pay down the ignorance tax.
Just focus on food and knowledge and you'll be much better off for it.
So lots of love.
This is not as good as my first 18 minute rant but hopefully, Why I brought the points out in this one, with my mute not on.
15:05
So lots of guys, and I'll catch you guys on the flip side.
Alright, bye.
Why I brought the points out in this one, with my mute not on.
So lots of guys, and I'll catch you guys on the flip side.
Alright, bye.









0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.

It's not as bad as I thought it's actually a pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
Hey, which one of you guys are having a Magnificent mantastic Monday.
I have four different things that I wanted to talk about and I'm going to combine them into one story that hopefully should be epic and awesome.
So - lessons in a fitness from a recent failure, so not that long ago.
0:34
I want to say three weeks ago, I got, I was invited to speak at a mastermind for online personal trainers and so it was interesting because there's a lot of things that now, when I look in retrospect, that didn't go right.
But anyways, I had a three-hour.
0:52
Speaking blocks is very long block of time and so I was asked to kind of teach for most of it and then kind of make an offer at the Into a force up on some Secrets, which some of you guys might know is our whole training on how to sell supplements and how they just make you far more money and help you acquire more customers and monetize your CS4 based a lot better.
1:11
Right.
That's the the shortage.
But anyways, so I spoke there and everyone was like, absolutely blown away like the vibe in the crowd, was amazing for the first two hours, right?
And then, I kind of did this kind of like, honestly, like half-assed pitch where I kind of like to skip through a bunch of Stuff.
1:30
And then was just like, yeah and here's stack and, you know, you can get it for that because in my mind at the time, it seemed like, well, obviously like to do all these things.
You need this.
So, like you should, you should get it right?
And it was horrible.
It was horrible.
I bombed.
And like I started getting peppered with questions on stage about, like, why are there three grams of sugar in this and like, why did you use super Alloys?
1:50
This aspartame versus TV evolved later.
I mean, if they were trainers talking in this way and like I know, because I've been doing this a while that they just like, haven't moved far away.
Going to put their business.
And also, they haven't talked to Trevor cashew for him to break all the beliefs around all of those things with science.
Right.
2:06
And on stage.
It's not like you have the time to like sit down and break every one of these individual beliefs and so it was just like absolute disasters, horrible.
Right.
It was literally like only one of the most like momentous failures I've had in a while and so as I was sitting in the back room and I just felt like and I was, I was kind of like trying to like audit myself and think like how am I feeling about this right now brother?
2:26
What are my emotions?
That are feeling right now and the honest truth.
Is that like after a failure for me, it's just rage.
It's just anger right now.
I was thinking about that and thinking about other people that I know when, when something doesn't go their way, they get sad, or they get ashamed, or they get embarrassed, but like, and then it goes until like, depression and sadness rather than anger.
2:47
And I don't, I don't know if I have.
Like I have the belief that I think anger is a better response because like people who are sad don't do anything.
People were angry, become obsessive and want to fix things.
And so I think that's always been my like driver.
And I get excited when I have that kind of anger because I know it's about to lead to a big period of growth and so anywho, like, first thing that I wanted to cover just like one, are you mad?
3:12
Are you sad when something doesn't go right?
And then how do you process that internally, right, that's the first thing and if you feel you're like you're some of these people who get depressed or get sad.
I would say like maybe if like, I mean, maybe it's great to just have zero positive, negative emotions, this is so great for opportunity of Provement, but like, for most of us were human and like something's going to happen.
3:34
And for me I think in pissed off and being angry at myself, about being inadequate and thinking, like what what what am I going to learn from this?
Because if I don't learn anything from this, and this failure and this feeling is in vain, right?
And so, that was the first thing and the lessons that I want to share with you the things that I learned afterwards, which led to another presentation that I gave on Friday, which was huge success.
3:53
And I want to kind of walk through the things that I learned.
So the first is no more half-measures.
So if you ever have the opportunity to do something, you either do it all in or you don't do it at all, which means that I should have when I went to that, that Mastermind or whatever.
4:09
When I did that presentation, I should have either said, listen, I can train and teach where I can pitch.
Which one do you want?
Like, I can't do.
I have Z?
I can't do a middle because middle grounds don't work.
So no more half-measures.
And so I make these videos just as much for myself as I do for everyone else because like, I want to remember these lessons as I continue.
4:29
Onwards.
And so that was the first one is no more half-measures.
Either go all-in on training or go all-in on pitching.
Okay.
Now, the next thing that happened is I had I had this this this event that was coming up, right?
And so this was at GSD Khan and so that was my Garcia's event and I had a one-hour speaking slot.
4:49
So you would imagine that one.
I was the first one.
I was kind of positioned a little bit better and I had a longer speaking slot.
So you think that I would have sold more right?
And the reality is it wasn't even close to that.
So I went to my car seats event and it was a fool when I was like, no half measures, like, I'm 100% Going to pitch and that is how this is going to be and what was interesting?
5:10
And this is what's crazy in.
This is a belief that was shattered for me that I want to shatter for you so that you don't have to get on stage and succour get in front of a group and suck.
Okay.
Is it after I had the presentation with my ride did 100% a picture did 437 slides in 60 minutes.
5:25
I mean, like, it was, it was aggressive.
It was violent.
I had so many messages after that pitch of people thanking me for the presentation and how much value they got and how their minds were blown.
Because what happened is that in that 60 Minutes, I did the real thing that matters which I was able to break beliefs, which is how you sell, right?
5:48
The first time I did it.
When I was training, I was giving people tactics, right?
But the thing is, is I didn't break their beliefs first, and if you give people Up breaking their beliefs about whether something is possible, they don't act on them.
And so I was doing ultimately a disservice that that entire Community because I was not able to pinch them, sell them on taking action in order for me to actually help them.
6:14
And so that First Community, I did a massive disservice to them by a doing a half-measure not going all-in, right?
And secondly, by teaching before breaking beliefs and so that is probably been one of the biggest lessons that I'm going to like it's etched on my soul right now because it's so recent and so fresh for me.
And so like when I went Into this event.
6:31
Like I'm telling all of you this because it was so huge for me.
Like, I had so much positive feedback.
I had more positive feedback from me pitching, then for me teaching, which is insane to me, right?
I mean, it's still insane to me.
6:46
I'm still like reeling from it because it's, like, my mind is blown right now.
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business going to A hundred dollars.
Plus we would love to talk to you and if you like that would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
7:13
But I had so much positivity and so now I'm like, deconstructing why it is?
And because ultimately the the highest level that you can serve someone in any defined period of time is breaking their beliefs about what's possible, the biggest thing, no matter.
What anyone says about why Jim Lords and Legacy is so valuable is because you see other people that are just like you making four times more money than you and you're like holy shit I can do this, right?
7:39
That is the biggest thing.
Same thing with Jim launches, you get in there and you see all these people Who are it in 30 grand, 40 grand, 50 Grand and their first go-round and you're like holy cow, this can happen for me.
Like I believe this and that belief is broken.
I could have given all of the click here.
7:54
Click there.
This is the ad you should run.
This is how you do a sales script.
But until I break the belief, nothing happens.
And so, if you want to serve your people, you want to serve your community, you want to serve people who are coming in, who are brand new it is honestly, and I believe this now even more to my core units obligation to sell them because that how you will break their beliefs into actually helping them achieve what they want.
8:17
Because I can tell you, from the room that I did with my car, see versus the room that I did with the first event.
I'm going to help so many more gems.
Now, use these systems to actually grow their gyms, right versus now, I walked away from a stage and they're going to just keep living their lives and that's going to be that, right?
8:35
And so like never be afraid to sell if you do it.
Well and so the biggest thing is like when you are selling people feel weird about selling and like even myself like I mean like I like I'm human too and I think like no I'm just going to write a shitload of value and then obviously I'll just like making An offer, and they're going to want to buy it, right?
8:54
Because I just provided so much value, but it's not true, it's not true didn't work.
And instead, I just broke all of the major beliefs around selling product selling food, selling things, besides service at your facility that everyone is like, oh my God, you totally changed the way I see my gym, I totally see it as like another distribution center for myself.
9:15
Like I have this network of people that I should be monetizing an additional ways and like their beliefs were broken.
And by extension their life was changed.
The amount of value that they were able to get from the presentation in 60 minutes was far superior to any, single tactic, I can teach anyone.
And so, if you're in, you're selling process, right?
9:34
And mind you in the 60 Minute presentation, I didn't provide any tactics because I didn't have time.
Like all I had to do all I was focused on was what are the major beliefs that someone has are on?
Why they shouldn't sell supplements?
Which the first one is like well there's no money and let me show you why there is and then like well how is this actually helping my customers and then I show them wide.
9:52
Actually helps our customers and give lots of belief cases on like, how like how this person wasn't paying enough.
Now, they pay more, they pay more attention to more investment to get better results, right?
Just over and over again, right?
And then third, how do I get my team involved?
How do we get them, bought it?
Well, I don't think that she's gonna be invested.
Will let me show you how you can actually pay them, more, get them or invested.
10:10
And so, then by extension, you can have better people.
You can retain them longer.
They get more, they get more engaged and then they stay more invested in the community.
By oh my gosh.
That's a belief this program and then finally how this actually works right?
And the how this works is really where Present the actual opportunity, the vehicle that you're providing to solve the like cool.
10:26
So this is all possible and if you want I can tell you how we do it and then that's kind of like, what introduces the actual the pitcher the solution.
And so when you are selling someone in person, I want you to have the conviction that like your goal is to break their beliefs.
It is not to talk to them about their macros, and it's not to talk to me about the workouts.
10:43
If not, to talk about the programming, it's not to talk about any of that shit.
It doesn't matter, right?
It doesn't matter because they don't believe you yet, right?
And so you have to bring take the beliefs first, you have to break the beliefs first and then you can present the solution.
11:00
I did it backwards.
I presented the tactics in the solution before breaking the belief, which is like such a fundamental error.
It's such a noob mistake and I just want to tell you that I make him to write and it sucked like I got out.
I was angry.
I was so pissed off, he turns.
So - so quickly I was like on stage for another hour.
11:16
Just like, I mean it was ugly like the girls like well I only do or, you know this I I preach not selling supplements like so what's your idea?
And I was like don't do it next and there she was like I can't believe you'd say that was like I don't have time to break your belief right now.
You don't I mean and that's what I should have done in the whole presentation was Breaking All the beliefs rather than teaching the tactic.
11:38
And then all my questions that I had were all there for limiting beliefs around why they couldn't do it.
And so, I'm telling you this so that you don't make the same mistake.
Whether you're pitching in person, you're cooking 101 or start pitching in big grouper.
Putting one on one is that you have to start with the beliefs you break the beliefs.
And then you can change someone's life afterwards and you can give them the do this, do that.
11:56
But don't do it backwards and don't do a half measure.
Don't sort of tell them what you're going to do and then sort of present the offer like you have to fool on commit to Breaking beliefs.
In the thing is and here's my belief that was broken is that I believe that people would see me as salesy for that.
12:11
People wouldn't believe that I was providing value.
When in fact, me selling and breaking their belief was biggest value out, I could have possibly done in a 60 Minute time T.
So anyways, I'm super excited.
And for those students who are coming on, we've got 30 40 Jim's who signed up just from that presentation, which is awesome.
12:30
And I'm talking to those guys tomorrow which is super cool.
But anyways, I hope this is valuable for some of you guys and hopefully this breaks a belief of yours about selling in general is that like if you feel like you have to get into that stuff, you don't like people value beliefs being broken more than anything else in the world.
When people go to Tony Robbins, big events, like, upw, what happens, he doesn't give you any tactics.
12:52
The only breaks your beliefs because once you break someone's beliefs, you can change their life because you change the way they see the world and the way they process information, if you've known anyone who became like a born-again Christian or somebody who changed religions and then went all in on that on that new thing, right?
13:08
You notice the way they change everything about their life changes the way.
They talk the way they dress the way they, they the way they perceive the world, the way they act, all of those things change, as a result of the belief being broken, you could have given that all of the reasons in the tactics.
For them changing the way they see the world as being nice and all that stuff.
13:25
But it's not until the belief is broken that the subsequent transformation occurs.
And so this was a reminder for me and I'm making this just as much for myself as I am for you, is that like when you go go all in, no half measures.
So all the way break everyone's beliefs so that you can help them and they will perceive that as the biggest benefit you can possibly give someone is breaking the beliefs of what is possible.
13:45
So anyways, I love you all hope your is amazing day and if you're a gym owner, You should you know because I'll get you soon.

Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
Hey, what's with everyone?
I wanted to make this video because they're calling it trade-offs, The True price of your desire.
0:42
And the first one was a Nissan Trotter when he flew out.
And I've had a couple people actually got, a lot of people fly out to our home to for VIP day.
So people whenever they sell a certain amount of stuff we do, like top 10, top 7, you know, etcetera and we fly them out and in Really one of the things that comes back is there like I think it just became real to me how like all in you are on this and so like there's some things that aren't conveyed that I can only convey in like in person.
1:14
But I'm going to do my best to kind of convey this to you.
The other reason that I wanted to bring this up was because I had there's a thread in the Legacy group about, there's a single mom, who's like, you know, what?
Like, how are you guys managing this?
How are you managing your business and being a single mom single parents?
It's all To to address that because like this is the real, you know?
1:32
I mean like this is the real real.
And so what I want to tell you is the things that you have that I don't have right.
So like there are some places that you are trading off that you have things that I don't write.
Like, I don't have a social life, I don't, I don't have weekends.
1:53
I don't, they are the exact same to me as weekdays except I get more done because I have less meetings, I don't have like, I don't have a really close family relationships.
I don't talk to my mother, barely at all.
2:09
I talked to my father on a very limited selection of topics that we have predefined as things that don't piss.
Either of us off, right?
I don't have siblings.
I have to step siblings.
I have Seen in multiple years, I haven't talked to them for any extended period of time over the last five.
2:31
I'm trying to explain this to you.
I don't have kids and so like everything that I do is to grow this and for those of you who are listening right now and were like I don't want that life.
Cool like good.
2:47
You know what I mean?
Like, that's fine.
And it's okay.
And if there's like, well, I don't have to give X up in order to have why they're at is, is like maybe, but maybe not, you know, and it's also a question of speed, you know what I mean?
Like, there are certain amounts of time within the day that you can do things.
3:05
And if you're putting more like, it's stress me out, that little wanted to get a cat.
Just exist.
You guys understand like where I operate from like getting cat, stress me out.
Out.
Because I thought there's going to be moments where I'm going to want to get stuff done and like I like atoms like I do.
3:20
I like them.
It's like a weakness.
I got love, like, I love them, right?
But I know that.
And so I didn't want he's not out of my office, right?
And so like he can't be around, because when he was here, for the first week, I couldn't get shit done because I just wanted to like, pet him and hold him in like you and me out.
He will come.
You don't walk a little, my keyboard to like but it was distracted.
3:37
Right?
And so I'm only bringing this up because there was there's a video that I made on my on my Facebook probably fingers three years ago.
So this is right before I actually made the 180 decision to sell, all the gyms, I to plan to open for more and get to 10 by the end of the year, all right?
3:53
And so we were at six at the time and I knew, which location for going to do 4 7, 8, 9 and I made this video about things that I was willing to give up the things that I was willing to sacrifice.
And so I listed some of these things and these are things that I still don't do.
But some of you met like I don't follow any sports teams.
4:11
I don't have a team.
I don't know what the stats are like, I don't Don't you don't watch like like, like in that video at that point in my life.
I'd given up Netflix at any kind of relaxation, right?
I didn't read books, I didn't have Ted Talks, right?
4:27
Like, the only thing that I was doing, was trying to grow my gyms, right?
And at that time, I had no kids, no wife, no girlfriends.
You'd be like, no family, no nothing.
You know what I mean?
And so like, when people find person they're like, oh, like I get it.
4:45
Like this is all you do and I'm like, yeah, like this is all I do.
Like, this is my game, right?
But the thing is, it's like that's a trade-off.
And like the thing is this, like, for me, I value what we are doing more than I value.
5:01
These other things right now if that's not you, that's cool.
Just be like just understand.
And also and I'm trying to say this in a good way because like if you see Um, person, who's achieving these crazy things.
5:17
Look at the trade-offs that they have and ask yourself.
Is that a trade?
I'd be willing to make and it might not be, it isn't for most people which is why they don't achieve what they think they want.
Because the reality is that everyone has something one.
It's just not what they what they wish they wanted, right?
5:35
Like I wish that I wanted to have the body, I wanted more than staying in bed, right?
But you really want to stay in bed more and that's why you look the way you look, you wish you wanted this more.
But you don't write you wish you wanted to have the really successful business but you really actually want to spend more time catching up with friends and plan fight you know, Rec football or watching your, you know, spending Sunday watching football or Saturday watching college, but whatever it is right?
6:02
Like you want this, you want to want this other thing but you really want what you already do.
Because if you wanted it more, you would just do that, right?
And so I guess in some way of trying to give permission to the people.
Ooh, like keep beating themselves up about what they're not doing to just be like it's okay.
6:20
Like I think it's just a better of accepting the fact that you don't want that and that's fine.
Like 80% of the people who go into SEAL training, don't quote me on the staff but the majority of the people going to Seal training to be a Navy SEAL drop out, they don't kick cut, they drop out on their own volition, they've Fallen terribly leaked, despite preparing for years, taking all these tests, and all of this stuff to qualify, It to be selected to go into the school to become a Navy SEAL and they drop out.
6:51
And the reason they say they drop out is because they don't think it's worth it, it's not worth it.
This is too much shit to put up with and they're probably right, and the school is meant to do that to weed out who wants it the most.
7:06
And so they make people go through things that test how much they value this thing.
So like, That's like all it is.
It's just the trade-offs.
And I just want this to be real for everyone because like I don't have what many of you have.
7:22
I don't, I don't have and I've sacrificed lots of areas that most people find important.
I don't, but many people find important to achieve.
What I do believe is important to me.
Hey guys, real quick.
7:38
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I push the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
8:07
So I think that like there's all the tactics and there's all the business strategy and there's all this other stuff, right?
And it's important but the only reason I was able to study all of that stuff and spend all that time and like compress the amount of time it took us to achieve X is because I probably done the same amount of like actual work that some people do in 15 years in five, right?
8:30
It's because I don't have all of these other things that they give their time and more importantly their attention to, right?
And so Just I'm just trying to paint this for everyone because like like and this is not meant to be some like motivational accessory free.
Like you know, like like f is ready to do every day like it's just not, it's like that's not my style but I'm saying like logically.
8:50
Like I don't have anything but this right I've got Layla I work out.
That's it.
And then like I say that it's still on some love you like I get that but then when people see us in person they're like oh shit.
9:05
Like you really doesn't do anything but work and work out and hang out with his wife.
Like that's actually all he does and it is literally all I do.
And when I had my gyms and I grew six and three years, right?
Like people were like, wow, how did you go?
9:21
Six gyms in three years because I didn't do anything else.
I didn't have friends.
I didn't have social life.
I didn't have kids, you know me.
Like I didn't I don't have any of that.
I moved to an area where people didn't know who I was.
9:38
I went to Huntington Beach and I'm from Baltimore Maryland.
I didn't know anyone and so I had no time to do all this other stuff and so I had no choice but to just commit my time to this, which is the only thing that I got filming from.
And so like I'm just painting this picture for you that it's okay if you're like well I'm a single mom.
9:56
I want to do that.
I'm like good do don't like it's fine but don't expect to get the same return, right?
Because I'm investing more in this.
You're getting a higher return on your kids.
I just don't have it.
So like I returned his here right but like I like don't expect you to return on it like actually expect to return on investment to be safe.
10:19
I'm just investing more.
Right.
And that's, and that kind of wraps until a different talk that I was going to make separate.
But like, while we're doing it, let's do it.
Is that there are two types of people that I've seen in The Entrepreneur Space.
There are optimizers and there are maximizers.
10:35
Alright, optimizers are minimum, effective dose, 80/20 Barreto principal.
Just do what I like.
I want to have a lifestyle business.
I Want to Be Free of this.
I want to make money and not have to plug pop like that.
Is that Cyprus?
And that's okay.
It's fine, right?
But that person will never be a maximizer.
10:54
Never in a million years because maximizers understand that diminishing returns are still returns.
Right.
Like going from my first first sale to my under stale, I need more gains in the 0 to 100.
11:10
Then I did from 100 to 1000, but I'm a way better at 1000 than I am at 100.
And that's the difference like Olympians consistently trained for hours and hours and hours to get a tenth of a second off of something.
And what's interesting is that despite the fact that you get diminishing returns from maximal input, you get disproportionate returns as you approach, the diminishing return line and so it's two asymptotes, right?
11:36
As you progress, progress, get slower and slower and slower.
But the return on your progress gets higher and higher and higher.
Because the difference between In first place in the Olympics, and third is enormous, right?
And so as those tiny little incremental returns happened, you get this huge exponential lift on the back end.
11:55
And that is why maximizers beat optimizers every single day of the week, right?
And so, like, that is how I live.
I'm a maximizer.
Like, when I played video games as a kid, I would literally keep playing the same level and took like level to until I maxed out all of my stats before going to level 3 because and I would hit the same the same like go around the tree in the same bed with a Do that for like 15 hours straight, the same one because I wanted to know that when I got to the next level I would crush it right because I messed up right?
12:24
Like that it's messed up.
It's not good.
It's probably not healthy, right?
Probably die, mentally.
All, but like, that's how I am.
And the people that I see like, who actually murdered are like that, they have that thing that's broken inside of them, right?
And so like, if you have a minimum effective dose type person, that's your personality, that's fine.
12:42
It's fine, it's okay.
You know what I mean?
Like it's that's you, right?
But if you if you think to yourself like all of these things that I have, I'm willing to sacrifice, X, Y, and Z to achieve W, right to achieve, the wind to achieve, whatever my goal is, if you have that then change.
13:05
But just know what you're turning off, right?
I know what my trade-offs are, and I've measured them, and I'm more than comfortable to do that.
And if anything, I try and find more things that I can throw into the fire that I can trade off and that's why I don't cook my food.
I don't clean my stuff.
13:20
I don't make my bed.
I don't like I don't do my laundry, I don't do my grocery shopping.
I don't buy my stuff on Amazon.
I don't write thank you cards, every single thing that you can possibly think of I have outsourced so that I can get more time back because I Everything for this community so that we can grow so that we can change what I believe is valuable to me, right?
13:41
And I get a tremendous amount of satisfaction from knowing that there are lots of people who don't want to do that, and then I can Empower them to live their minimum effective, dose life, that they can have their lifestyle like that.
I know that their Fitness professionals right now, who weren't going to be able to have time with their kids that they can now do that because of the work that we are putting in that makes Me sleep.
14:05
Well at night, I don't need it.
I don't want it.
I don't care for it, but I know that thousands of people do and that's what gives me Solace, like I'm good with that.
Like, I'm cool with that trade.
I die tomorrow, I'm good, like I'm good with this, right?
And so, like, that's the trade-off, that's the game, understand the things that you have and figure out which ones you want more.
14:25
And then if you're not living in accordance with that change and if you are, then accept it and be cool with it.
And stop beating yourself up about it because it's all right, you're trading off growth.
So that you can spend time with your kids, that's fine.
You know what I mean?
Like, don't feel guilty about it, but don't compare yourself to somebody who's going all-in.
14:43
Like, don't compare yourself to me because you're not giving up what I'm giving up.
It's okay.
Here.
I mean you have to so anyways guys I hope you have an amazing day.
Hope this like for anybody who is like feeling guilty about like why isn't things happen faster like why don't like XYZ like I hope this just gives like, right some clarity to why that is.
15:02
It's just, you probably have things that you find important that other people don't write.
And like you might not want to sacrifice those things and that's totally okay, you know?
So anyways, hope you found this valuable.

Hello everyone.
Happy Sunday!
Hope you guys are having a great start or end beginning of the end or end of the beginning of the weekend.
And so I wanted to make a video for you today.
Podcasting I could yeah I was going to really call this how to deal with shit but instead I'm going with no pain, no gain and so I wanted to outline two of the strategies that I think have helped me become more resilient in the face of like a mental strife.
0:47
And I think that as we continue to grow in entrepreneurship and the size of our countries grow and impacts etcetera like having strong processes mental processes in place in order to safeguard yourself.
I've become more and more important.
And so, one of the ones that I wanted to bring up is around anger.
1:06
And so, I think whenever anything bad happens, right?
There's typically one of two responses, either you become angry, or you become sad, right?
Sometimes they happen in different order, you know, like some people never gets anyone ever get angry, some people get both, you know, it's just kind of its a mix.
I can really only speak to the anger side because I'm just not I'm not like a sad, like I just don't go that way.
1:30
Like, when something bad happens, because it immediately, even if I have a feeling of sadness, I get angry with myself for feeling that way, for feeling, weak, and not taking control, and then I get angry, you know what I mean?
So it's almost immediate.
But the thin, then what happens is when you do with that anger.
1:47
And so, fry, dive into that.
It's just like, why do we get angry, right?
We get angry, because typically, we feel wronged, right?
And so that immediately comes from a place of elevation, like, you feel like you You were above something, how dare someone do something to you?
And it's typically someone who you've brought into your circle, who then betrays you in a certain way, whatever that be.
2:06
Now in a business context, there's four, there's lots of different kinds of betrayal and relationships.
There's lots of different types of trout, but usually, it's just you feel wrong, right?
It's typically when a promise is made or an unspoken promises made and then it is broken, right?
And then that is where you feel like justice is warranted, right?
2:23
And so, since you don't see that person suffering for the feeling that you have, You want to make them suffer, right?
And that's kind of kind of where the anger comes from, at least, a mile to my understanding.
So how do you deal with this?
Right?
Because the bigger you get the more times we were going to break things or break.
2:39
What you perceive to be relationships and do things that are wrong.
Like the amount of times I mean, just I wish I could give you a laundry list of all the things that have happened.
You know what I mean to to give context, but like any partnership stealing money like I mean like like literally you know the employees going behind your back.
2:56
Trying to tell people.
What a refund against doing that they're going to do something for like everything you can possibly imagine, right?
You know, just everything you can imagine has happened, right?
And so the thing is, I think that in order to continue to grow, you need to have really strong processes in place in order to process these things where they will destroy you.
3:14
Right?
They'll destroy.
And so there's two cornerstones stories that shaped my life, but I wanted to share with you.
So, the first one is from when I was in high school, when I was in ninth grade at a teacher named Steve given see someone who stayed with me after school.
Cool.
A lot of the after-school donation stuff that we do is, is a big part because of that and he worked out with me after school every day.
3:34
And so, when I was in ninth grade, I remember I was such an angry kid, but I think a lot of people are here.
I'm in ninth grade like, you're confused your kid, whatever.
But I was a pretty angry kid and he, I was like, man.
I can't wait to come back.
The high school reunions, I'm going to show everyone, you know, blah, blah blah.
3:52
And he was like, That doesn't that doesn't actually work in reality.
I was like, what do you mean isn't where it's like, I'm gonna show them and he was like if you actually come back 10 years from now and you go up somebody who's like booked you and you tell them that like look at you now he's like you're gonna look like an idiot because they're going to know that you've been thinking about them this whole time.
4:11
And they didn't even think about you like they forgot you existed.
He's like so there's you can't do that because then you actually already lost, and I was like shit.
Like what am I like, how do I get on me?
How do I get this out?
You know, I mean, how to get this, this rage on.
What do I do, right?
And so, you left me with a statement that whenever I get really angry about something I turned to which is success, is the only revenge.
4:35
And so that's been something that's always cycled in my head whenever I get really upset about something like really angry.
When I feel like someone wrongs me, its success is the only Revenge because it's the only thing you can do.
If you think about it there's nothing else you can do, right?
4:50
You can't go hurt people.
That's not going to serve you.
You're going to get hurt in the long run, right?
There's a lot of people who said this statement, what I like a lot which is like being angry is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die, right?
And so all it is, is you just brewed and get angry and you become less effective, right?
5:09
And so then and then sometimes it starts turning towards yourself, you start becoming self-destructive instead of destroying the other part and then it's like, then they went even more and then it makes you more Angry.
You know what I mean?
It's to this, it's a cycle.
And so the only way that have been able to break that is by understanding and continually repeating that, which is like success is the only Revenge which then allows you to To sublimate which is taking a negative emotion, getting a positive, a positive outcome from it.
5:30
And so I learned about that.
What that is sublimation is like when you were upset, go for a run and then all of a sudden, something that was negative in your life becomes a benefit because a positive.
Right?
And so, for me, and obviously depends on the on the level of the grievance that you're going through, how much anger you have and how much you need to expend in order to kind of come back to Baseline is with the initial burst of rage and I think I would describe it more as Rage or at least that's how I It's it just like, you know I mean for me it's the only way that I've been able to get around that stuff and the thing is the longer in the game, the more things like this will happen, just because you're exposed to it by nature of time, right?
6:10
You're going to be wrong, two more times, the bigger you are, and the longer you stay in, right?
The more beat up, you are in the arena.
And so the only way you can stay in is to keep yourself in, is to keep your head straight and so success is the only revenge and so, Channel everything into that into the thing that's going to be the only Revenge you have, which is continuing to succeed.
6:30
And yeah, that's it.
So that's that's like Cornerstone Story.
Number one that has helped me deal with anger and that's in the immediate.
So how to diffuse it in the moment when you want to go and write some nasty Facebook post or do some really mean live or blah blah blah blah, whatever it is right whenever you have that feeling and you type it up and you're like I shouldn't send this like you probably should write and just remembering It's like being ingrained in my mind and maybe it's because it's such a young age that I heard it, but it was like, I was so angry at that time.
7:02
And then that's when I started lifting harder, you don't.
I mean, it's just she's, like, take it out on the wait, man.
He didn't like and so he helped me push that in the right direction.
And so and I'm always grateful for it.
And obviously, as you get older, sometimes like you can push it into the weight.
I am going to go work out but sometimes there's still some left over you know.
7:19
And so what do you do with that?
And so when you have the leftover anger, the anger after the after the dust settles, you're still So enraged about something right?
What do you do?
Hey, if you're a return listener and you have not rated or reviewed the show, I want you to know that you should feel absolutely terrible about yourself and everything else in the world.
7:39
I'm kidding.
But it would mean the absolute world to me.
If you guys would go ahead and do that, you don't have to pause the show, you keep listening and you can just do with your thumb right now will take you less than 60 seconds.
And like I said, the only way that podcast arose through word of mouth and this is you joining hands with me and helping as many isomers with possibly can because no one is coming to save us, it's just us.
7:56
All right, so please go do that now then let's get back to the show. so, for me, I was, I mean, obviously, we've been angry more times than once in your life.
8:12
And so a deeper anger was towards parent, I had and so are still have.
And the way that I dealt with that was I actually had a paper that I had to write in college and it was on mental disorders and so we had to pick someone, we knew actually and then and then look at what potential disorders.
8:32
They might have.
It was a weird kind of paper but it was interested in ecology or something like that.
So, Ways I took it and you had to look at all of the person because you have to look at Psychology in terms of how people development, you know.
I mean like you know, where were they?
At each of these developmental stages, what things are they going through?
Based on what you have, you can interview them asking more questions.
8:47
So you get more insight and then you write a paper, you know, about that person and what factors may have potentially created, who they are their identity, their personality, their value system, right?
All that stuff.
And once I wrote this, the person that I was extremely upset With is what I wrote it about.
9:07
And by the end of finishing, a paper, I was no longer upset with them because I understood them, and I understood why?
And so, the second kind of big quote.
So the first one is successes, the only Revenge, I think the second quote is to understand, is to forgive, you can't understand and be angry at the same time.
9:28
It's actually really difficult.
And so the moment you really truly understand someone or truly understand, And where someone is coming from and see their perspective.
Truly not just say like I get where you're like, I get your side but not like what they're saying but what experiences they went through to create the value system that creates that worldview like true deep understanding.
9:52
Once you have that, it's really difficult to be angry.
And so I think in like the the 911 urgency moment you have to like Channel it into something that's going to sublimate something that's going to be a positive benefit to you.
The initial rate, right?
And then after that, after you have your, you know, your big adrenaline rush or whatever, and it's gone, then you have to look at like, okay, what experiences this person go through?
10:17
What upbringing, what, what things have happened?
What things have happened.
Recently, what things have happened?
Long term that might have created an environment inside of this person where they would think this was, okay, right?
And so a lot of time thinking about it like and like really get in there and so I'm not sure if I'm allowed to say, I say that.
10:36
So I was heartbroken once in my life not by a girl but by my best friend.
And what I mean by that was I had dated a girl for two years and then I had split up with her and it was a hard split up for me.
10:52
I mean I was the one who initiated that but like it's still, you know, like you pick up anyone.
Still, it's a hard period of your life and so, I leaned on my friend, right?
And then he was kind of nowhere to be seen and I was like, I don't really get this and A year later, I found out that like basically the moment that I had split up he had started dating her in secret for a whole year and then they told me and they kept it like private from everyone like the entire school.
11:19
Like they only met in secret it was like this really super dodgy thing to show.
You kind of like how fucked up it was.
But anyways the moment I found out about that, it was like pure rage, you know.
I mean that that like how dare they do?
They like keep this for me and be, you know, do this in secret like sodas.
11:36
SEPTA van, blah, blah, blah.
You don't even like just rage that I was experiencing but I knew that as soon as that happened, I was gonna be able to grow a lot from it.
And so the way that I was able to get over that rage, right?
And not do something really stupid was I wrote a story, their Love Story from his perspective.
11:56
And so I wrote this to try and understand like how would if I were him.
How would I explain this?
How would I tell this story?
When she were like, oh my God, how did you meet, right?
How would he see this experience through his own lens?
12:13
That would allow him to be okay with making that action and secret despite us being best friends and all this kind of stuff, right?
And then once I went through that whole thing I understood and then I was no longer angry, I'm not saying that I thought it was right, but the motion that was associated with it, diffused.
12:31
And then, I was able to continue to function and then go back to the primary, which is success, is the only Revenge And so it that's that's been kind of the the 12 pillars of dealing with like massive emotional issues in short periods of time because you have to have that those tools.
12:47
You know, I mean in Your Arsenal that kind of armor because the like the higher up, you go the harder, it gets it doesn't get easier.
It gets heavier and thicker.
Your, I mean in the attacks get more direct and more personal and more whatever.
Right.
That's why I like someone.
I have no idea why people to get into politics.
Like, I mean, like, maybe sometime, like I have, no, I have no clue.
13:06
They go into it and just like her, like this is worth it.
I think that's really.
It is like, I don't know how they like this is the trade-off I'm gonna get destroyed.
Probably and like everyone's going to hate you for the rest of my life half the universe is going to be first my life, like that's rough, you know.
But anyways, that those are true, the Cornerstone stories of my life that have dramatically shaped how I deal with very stressful, things that happen and I hope that that helps you.
13:31
If you ever have to deal with stressful things or things that anger, you oh, I don't have one for being sad because I it's Downs.
Not I was not super real for me right now.
Maybe if I get really sad in the future about something, I'll let you know how I dive it before.
13:47
Right now, whenever I get sad, I get angry about the fact that I'm sad and I go right back to angry.
So anyways, guys, have an amazing day.
Hope you guys have a s word, sexy Sunday.
All right, easy oh, I don't have one for being sad because I it's Downs.
Not I was not super real for me right now.
Maybe if I get really sad in the future about something, I'll let you know how I dive it before.
Right now, whenever I get sad, I get angry about the fact that I'm sad and I go right back to angry.
So anyways, guys, have an amazing day.
Hope you guys have a s word, sexy Sunday.
All right, easy0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
Hello everyone and welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
We will talk about the sea.
Secrets of the 1% of gym owners, who are crushing it, and how they are doing it.
So today, we're going to be discussing a really simple concept.
0:39
This one will be a short one but it's just hopefully immediately actual for you.
One of the things that happens a lot of times when I get on the phone with new gym owners or you know divorce that were considering working with they, a lot of them are still training sessions and if you train sessions because you love training sessions, that's cool but understand that you are.
0:58
It's causing you to make less money.
Now, if you're using that to fulfill desire that's outside of making money and profits Etc, and that's fine.
But I know that 90% of the people who are doing that are not in that situation.
1:13
Most of them are doing it because they are trying to save money.
So here's why it's counterintuitive, why you shouldn't be training the training sessions, okay.
So like I said, a lot of times like, the programs that we have are very time-intensive, okay?
So, I like being really candid and upfront about it.
But mostly guys.
1:29
We work with add an additional 30,000 Revenue in the first 30 days.
Pretty crazy right now.
They can't do that if they're training training sessions because they're working a job that pays $15 an hour right and so if you want to not make fifth you know ten to Fifteen dollars an hour stop doing stuff that you can pay someone else ten to Fifteen dollars an hour to do because the natural.
1:52
Next question that like that, I have to prove the point is, do you think that your time is worth more than $15 an hour, right?
And most most Jim owners would say, yes, I do think that it's like cool.
And why are you selling it for that?
Why are you doing it?
2:08
So, one of the beautiful things about the economy, or in the nation that we're in, is that the way that work happens, right, is that new employee comes in and then they start working usually for two weeks ish right before they get their first paycheck, okay?
And so it's kind of a really cool thing because it's structured that way, because it allowed gives the business owner, two weeks to make enough money with the time that he's saving by not doing.
2:35
Doing the things that he's paying the employee to do to go make the money to pay the employee.
Right?
And so what happens is like for us, right?
That would they start our system?
They start getting leads and every day.
And so for them, the highest and best use of their time is selling right sales because in the afternoon, if they can close, you know, they can meet with 10 people and close Six.
2:59
Right conservatively at you know, like a five hundred dollar price point for, you know, a defined in program, you know?
See, We take weeks, whatever in that afternoon, they made three thousand dollars and that's because they didn't have to train for sessions that afternoon, which cost them $60, right?
3:17
And so by giving up sixty dollars to someone else, they created The L Word, leverage, there's a lot of things that I don't do in my business I shouldn't do them because it's not the highest and best use of my time.
You should learn how to do it so that you can teach someone how to do it the way you want it to be done.
3:33
But then, once it's been learned, you're then doing a job.
And the the point, like what you will do as an entrepreneur, as you will continually, put yourself out of a job.
All right?
So if you're not in that habit, you should be okay because, like, the first thing you're doing is, you're training, right?
3:50
The first thing you're doing is really just killing yourself because you're training you in front desk, you're doing admin and sales you to marketing and all this other stuff, right?
That's what you're doing the beginning.
But ultimately you want to move yourself up the income ladder of the job, right?
So the first thing you could Outsource is the training itself first thing, all right.
4:06
The next thing you're going to Outsource is all of the admin billing back work, whatever.
Okay the next thing Outsourcing and so then after that if you're so if you have a single location what you're focusing on is marketing and sales, right?
You're figuring out ways to get leads and then you're selling them because each sale to you is worth so much more than the time.
4:24
It would have taken you to.
Like, I mean, I tell people like if you had every afternoon off, I'm like do you think that you could get To sales a week.
For 500 bucks.
I like, do you think you can do that?
You think you go to the grocery store?
Do you think you called people in your phone book?
Like, forget about Facebook marketing, forget about Instagram, marketing.
4:41
Forget about all this other stuff.
Okay, do you think that in a week you could close to people on a defined in program, right?
Hey guys, real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
4:58
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 million dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers, make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
Its fo free in exchange for your email so that I can email you when we launched under the real leads and so that you can not miss out on it.
5:19
Because last time I sold out for like eight straight weeks really fast, so that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
Right.
Just like simple logical questions here.
So from the from the income ladder, what you're going to what you're going to move on to write first is you're going to Outsource training next, going to Outsource it admin.
5:36
Front desk, Etc, third, you'll Outsource the sales itself forth will usually happen is that you'll give that front admin person more responsibility or you'll give that sales manager, more sponsors to become more of a GM.
5:54
And then the only thing that you're responsible for His marketing your business, which kind of brings home the point of why I believe that, every business owner should be a marketer first, right?
Is that like, no one will make it rain for you and you can never trust an agency.
To like you got to learn it like you just got to do with the fact that you need to learn how to Market because they will not care about your business.
6:17
As much as you will, they will not keep tweaking campaigns until it works because they just don't care.
It's not their business.
I have never seen any of my friends who crush it.
All right, we have an outsourced marketing company running their marketing.
They always have someone who either has equity in their company or their somebody who's an employee full-time.
6:36
All they do is just mark it for them.
Most of the times it's not the actual marketing, they're Outsourcing, it's the actual plug-in of ads so they can they actually in putting but the offers and the creative.
Yeah, copy, so there's the things you can never really Outsource.
6:54
You have to know how to do that, and it's a skill and it's unfortunate that the world of the fitness industry.
Told us that all you need to do is give people great results and you're gonna be able to have a Fitness business because nothing that that you learned being a trainer has anything to do with running successful.
7:10
Crazy, right?
So anyways I told you I'd keep this one short so I'm going to try to stick to that.
If you are training your training sessions or doing your admin or your billing Works, Etc and you know that you could be going out and getting sales and driving more Revenue into your business.
7:28
Then you need to be Outsourcing those positions as soon as humanly possible.
So that you can take those extra hours that you no longer have to do and you can focus on the things that are going to produce the highest revenue.
For your business.
Okay?
So there's your tactic for today.
7:45
It's make sure that you Outsource your training, Etc, and you still have two weeks, and all you got to do is make one five hundred dollar sale, and you can probably cover those afternoon sessions, right?
So up, here's just a numbers thing.
Let's say it's three sessions.
Is what you guys have in the afternoon. 15 bucks, a session in California.
8:02
It was 1.22, which means it cost me like 1850 accession after active payroll taxes, Etc.
So, let's just say 20 bucks.
Okay, $20 times, 360 bucks and afternoon.
Let's say it's five afternoons, $300 and then again, three hundred dollars next week.
So, my question to you.
8:20
Is do you think that you know how to make six hundred dollars if you had all of your afternoons back?
The answer should be.
Yes if you don't then you need to learn the skill set and show you how to do that.
But for most of the answers.
Yes.
And if the answer is yes, then it means that you training sessions is no longer a logical business decision and need to move on because it's literally costing you the amount of money that you could be making in the afternoons by having those that time.
8:48
It's cost you that much money for you.

So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
Good morning.
We won clocking in from downtown by not downtown.
0:34
I mean Suburbia Austin.
I've been staring at my screen for the last like 30 minutes because I woke up and just this like combination of thoughts was on my mind and I was just like how am I going to articulate this?
And so this could get really deep in a good way, what?
0:51
I'm calling this, the three dimensions of leadership.
And so I'm making this because I think So many times I've been asked by people in our company, people who know me from from before the gyms, just all different times in my life, people have asked like, how how do you, how do you gain respect right there?
1:14
Like I feel like, I feel like your employees respect you.
I feel like feel like people respect you, you know, like how do you, how do I get that?
And it was, it's a really hard question for me.
And so I wanted to give you a little bit of backstory.
I think of how This kind of came to be.
1:30
So first off, just just some interesting backlog.
I, I was raised by a single dad and I had no siblings, and so all like my home life was just men, right?
It was a middle eastern.
1:45
Thought I went to an all guy school, which is again all men.
As soon as I went to college, I immediately joined a fraternity and surround myself by all men.
And I think it's because just like, on some level like I was more comfortable there and my audience.
2:04
If I look at Instagram and I look at Facebook and all that stuff is 80% male and the twenty percent of females that I think that come in tend to be entrepreneurs, and there's a lot of sort of traditionally male characteristics that go along with that.
2:22
Now, I'm not saying that.
Anyway, that's, that's bad or good.
In terms of, like milk, a trickster feeling bad or female, like, whatever.
I'm just saying like, that's what is right?
And so, I think that I've attracted that mix and that like, my life has been that way because my primary driver in life has been respect.
2:39
And so there's there's a an amazing series called love and respect.
It's for marriages, but I think it's one of the most profound understandings of how to deal with people besides like how to make friends and influence people.
I'd say the second thing that I would ever Watch is that it's a marriage series but it's really just about men and women and the differences in the drivers of how how to get people to do what you want them to do, right?
3:02
And how to have better relationships and that, that book in that series changed my life as well.
And it reinforced, it put words to a lot of the things that I did that.
I didn't know why.
And so respect, I called this, the three dimensions of leadership because I was trying to trying to think through what is it, right?
3:21
And if you look Get up.
It's just admiration of someone.
Do two qualities achievements etcetera.
But I was like, how does that what-what-what's?
Where's the teeth to respect, right?
And so, I was thinking, I was like, I think maybe it's the it's the middle point between fear and love and then I thought more about that.
3:40
I was like, I don't know if it's the midpoint because like, you know, I think Layla respects me.
I don't know if she fears me.
Well, maybe she does fear me.
They don't even some playing with this, and I think it looks more like a triangle.
And so I think it's more fear love and respect that sit on a triangle and we aim is leaders to be in the middle of that dot, right?
4:02
And if you think about that the midpoints between each of those three, let's say if you have respect and love the midpoint there, I would say is like loyalty, right?
And if you look at the midpoint between between fear and love, you have sacrifice, right?
4:20
And so if you look at like each of those, those Dimensions, you have like different characteristics, that kind of that kind of come out of them.
And so to go back to the initial question, like, how do you gain respect right.
And because it's been the only goal I've had in most of my life.
I didn't I never really saw to be love.
4:36
That was not.
It's not a primary driver if it did happen, it was not my not my goal.
It was it was a secondary thing and I think that because I've lived it all male-dominated organizations.
Sorry like my whole life has been predominantly male and then Even when I had my gyms, I really I think I only hired total three women ever between all the locations.
4:58
Like I mean, I just I was more.
It's not like it was a sexist thing is just like I was more comfortable with guys, and so it just ended up naturally happening that way.
And so, and I never had, I never had trainers, leave and steal clients.
Like, I never had any of those things happen, because the entire organization Randolph respect, right?
5:15
And the things that I've learned about respect is that it has to be given.
Before it's before it's received, and and, And you have to set that tone in the initial conversation.
And so like if someone's first day or first interaction with you, they come in and it's two minutes late.
5:34
If you're just like, please don't be late again.
I won't be late for you, like it automatically sets a tone because they're like, wow, like and but I respected them by being on time, and they didn't respect me by not being on time.
And so, it's like you set this tone immediately and you make these minor Corrections and you don't tolerate times where there's minor point Of disrespect and you point it out to the person so that they understand where you're coming from and what ends up happening is that you raise the expectations.
6:01
You raise the bar of the relationship and then as a result, respect follows.
And so this has been something, I'm probably going to dive more even deeper on because it's like, it's really messing with my head because I want to be able to impart this to, you know, the leaders of the company and then the managers in our company and everything is like, how do we, how do we gain that?
6:21
And so a lot of times Respect is also earned from sacrifice.
And so if you want especially like in the world of men, at least in my belief, is that if you want someone's respect, you have to do things for them, that they wouldn't expect you to do, right?
6:40
And so for example, I'm just giving you an example from like, the world of pledging, right?
And the reason I'm using that is because it's, it was a short period of time where you rapidly your introduced into a new environment and you want to rapidly gained respect, Spect.
Right?
That was kind of the environment.
6:55
So deconstructing like with the actions were in order to gain that, right?
And the way to do that in that environment was do more than anyone else.
Would offer to give more far past what was average or what was the most, but just give everything to the cause that benefited, the whole group.
7:12
And so if you sacrifice yourself and say, no guys, like I know you all have some tests tomorrow, like I'll work late tonight, like don't worry about it.
Like it's fine and consistently putting the group.
First is, what gains you respect, right?
7:28
And so, I feel like there's so many little micro points, and somebody like micro experiences that I've had, that have like, like, put that in my, like, respect Playbook of like, oh, okay.
Like whenever there's a little issue that comes up, that's that's either disrespect from here, them like announce it, right?
7:46
Or if I ever disrespect someone else, for example, by being two minutes late, the first thing I'll say is, like, first off, I want to, I meant no.
Respect by being two minutes late.
I didn't want to disrespect your time, I totally lost track and I apologize.
And I can't tell you how many times I've had, like, just things happen, right?
8:01
And I mean, I try to always be on time, but even if you're two minutes late or a minute late, right?
If you start a conversation like that with a vendor or a new employee or anything, I can't tell you the amount of times that people are taking it back and they're like, oh thanks like no.
8:17
But I appreciate that.
But no And so there's immediate level of respect of like this person's respecting.
My time, I'm going to respect his Back.
And so that was like, one little note in the respect Playbook.
You know what I mean?
Like, try and see if there's ways that I can sacrifice for the group.
So, if I'm on a sales team, right?
8:34
Like I'll be like, guys, I'll work the weekends, I'll take the late shift, like don't worry about it, I got this, and then like, I'll wake up earlier.
And then the thing is, is that people see that effort and they're like, man, like I respect that guy, like I respect his hustle, right?
And so there's probably different elements of things that people respect about you read, like maybe you were like that and work, but you're a whore.
8:53
Herbal husband, and people know that, but like really gonna respect that about him and so there's even more, you know, facets, which is kind of bringing in what Layla says, where you have to lead, what you live or live with you, whatever the legal you live a little chilly but if people see through like people want people want to respect someone and they just are waiting for reasons not to.
9:14
And I think that if you if you try and live the same life in secret or in private, as you do in public, then there's no there's no.
Inconsistencies between the two and people can see that because at the end of the day like everything always comes out, like the truth, always comes out and so if you try and live that truth and when you know you mess up you own that people respect you for it because like I've I mean a million people said this but like like Eminem if you can own your flaws and know that and then continue to work on them and people see you work on them, they respect you more for it than trying to posture and say like I don't have them because we all have flaws, right?
9:52
And so like these Are just some of the things that have come up like, and in trying to reverse engineer this because I want, I want my entire company to be, you know, run based off of respect and I probably lean too much in that direction because that's what I was raised in.
10:07
You know what I mean?
Middle eastern family, like it's all on respect, right?
Like I the, the test that they took in the love and respect which is really really interesting.
Is they have one question that they asked men and women and they do this is kind of like the onset of The entire seminar, which is if you like, I'm butchering the question.
10:28
But if you could be loved by everyone, right?
But but no one respected you for the rest of your life.
Would you prefer that or everyone respect you?
But have no love, which would you prefer, right?
10:44
And it's like, 80% of men.
Say they would prefer to be respected and not loved and like 80% of women are like, I would prefer to be Love, do not respect it.
And so it's just an interesting dichotomy between like how men and women in general, tend to respond to things.
11:01
And so I've like I consistently obsessed about this because it's probably been the primary driver of like how I want all my relationships in my life to work is based on respect and respect his Mutual, it's two ways, right?
And it's just like most things you have to give it before you get it and the way to consistently get it and keep it as to consistently sacrifice for the good of the whole.
11:19
And I think that's probably the biggest piece is sacrifice.
And putting the whole before yourself.
And I think when and doing that, not just in front of people but especially behind closed doors.
Because I think when I was younger and I wanted to gain respect, I always was trying to do it in places where people would see it.
11:40
And then I realized much later on that I got so much more respect.
When people would would notice things that they knew I didn't that they would notice things that I I had done that.
11:55
They knew that wasn't visual or wasn't public, and then they would tell other people about it, right?
And so it's kind of like coming into the party and saying, like we've got a business does X, Y and Z and Bob of Love versus you coming into a conversation with someone and having them posture against you and say like we've got a seven-figure business, right?
12:19
Whatever and you're like, that's amazing dude.
Good for you like you know, what are you doing?
And just being Interested in them and whatnot and letting them just like beat their chests.
And then what happens is they leave and then someone else comes up just like, do you know who that is?
And they're like, no, not that kind of this XY and z and then all of a sudden in that Dynamic that first person who was bragging feels like a fool, right?
12:42
And so immediately it's the things that other people say that are going to give you four more than anything you can say.
And so it's like if you want other people to say the things that you want them to say, what do we have to do in order to get them to say those things?
Things.
And so like making that realization for me was a huge kind of breakthrough for me because then it stopped being like about posturing publicly but about posturing privately.
13:04
And then what happens is and this is like kind of the funny part is if you start doing the things almost from an external standpoint because you selfishly want to be respected but you're doing the things in private in order to do that.
Then all of a sudden you start to change your identity because what you're doing in private Is respectable.
13:22
And so in a weird way, you kind of push out the things that are not respectable that you do in your life.
And so like, and one of the biggest things when I was like really like dealing with the demons that I had earlier on in life was understanding the concept of Shame, right?
So if you like the respect is what the goal is.
13:39
The opposite of that is shame and embarrassment.
And so, a lot of times I think the were like yeah and Alex is so real.
I mean, I just see this in the comments and whatnot and like a podcast, I want to like, I appreciate it.
But I think it was it was really hard for me to like when you own your flaws, it's the thing that you're most afraid to say out loud.
13:59
It's the things that you suck at because you're ashamed of it.
But when you take the things that you're ashamed of and you bring them to the light all of a sudden, what used to be perceived as shame is perceived as strength and its really interesting just understanding that like the things that I was ashamed of that I've done and that I've said Ed and how I've acted when brought into the light, like they only give you shame.
14:24
They only take up your attention in your head space when you try and hide it.
But when you bring it into the light and you talk about it, then people respect you for it and it's just this really interesting thing because I think on some level we all are like that but then you respect the person who had the courage to do it and so like in the in the respect Playbook it's like set the tone always don't disrespect people sacrifice for the good of the whole lead.
14:49
What you Live, like, do the things in the backgrounds and in the shadows, that people would think respectable, and we'll talk about you.
And then the one that I just set, and then like own your flaws, and bring them out publicly.
So that the things that you're ashamed, of actually become the things that people perceive as your strengths.
15:10
And so, like, going through this and like, you don't even like and this Playbook as like length and overtime.
And I might even make a follow-up.
If you guys like this.
But there's this like this, I didn't I didn't know what direction this is going to go in, but trying to understand that triangle of fear, love and respect and sitting in the dot, in the middle because like there is an element of fear when it comes to leadership, right?
15:35
Like if you think about and so even if you're not religious or whatever, if you think about the relationship that most people would have with their creator, whatever the omnipotent like being in their life is there's three elements, it's not just love, it's not just fear.
It's not just respect.
15:52
It's all three, right?
And it's just kind of like this Melting Pot of those three emotions.
And then the the actions that happen, as a result of that, or the things that happen between, if you have the respect and the love, that's where you're loyal.
You have the fear and the love and so you are see, that's where you sacrifice and when you have fear and respect your obedient, right?
16:17
And so you see these three triangles and the That exists between each of those, those binaries of the emotion on that triangle plane.
And that's how you can get those behaviors this by having all three of those things.
And so if you're like, I feel like I have no loyalty in my organization, right?
16:34
Then it means that they don't that you probably don't have the balance of respect and love, right?
And so I think you get loyalty because people see that you're making the decisions, not only out of out of respect for the company but also out of love for the Visual like people.
16:51
Like sometimes I don't attract women, I think because I can be perceived as abrasive, right?
Very direct.
And so sometimes that doesn't sit well with people who kind of, like, just walk into our environment, like it's a wall, right?
But I think that, that loyalty lives there because we're always trying to think, like, if I'm making the decision, like is this loving this person, is this actually in this person's best interest.
17:14
And that's why parenting is so different than being someone's friend, right?
Like, we have to do these things.
And like I'm saying this, not as a parent, but I feel like we run an organization like, in some ways the relationships very similar is like I need to I need to Foster this person and balance the the stick and the carrot, you know, mean of love and fear and balance this because I truly want the best for the individual.
17:40
Now, if you don't have that in mind, if people don't think you have their best interest in mind and the secret to having people think you have their best interest in mind is to actually have the best interest in mind.
Right.
And so if they don't feel like you have that, then you may have their respect but not their love and so then you don't have loyalty, right?
17:56
And so if you have people constantly leaving your organization, that's what it is, right?
And if you, if you, if you have people who like don't respect you, right and like talk shit behind your back and when you make, when you make statements in one another like they roll their eyes or whatever, then it means you might not have fear, right?
18:17
And so like it's It's constantly bouncing between these three forces.
In order to get, you know, the behavior that's desired.
It obviously, we're human and we're flawed and sometimes I lean too much towards fear.
I'll be real with you.
Like I there's probably a lot of people in my company that on some level fear me.
18:34
And I know that internet mean, I understand that and I'm not going to say that.
I don't sometimes Foster that a little bit because it's good to make sure everyone knows.
You still have teeth that like expectations are still expected to be met because if you don't have the fear that Means, you don't have accountability, there's no consequences, right?
18:52
And so there has to be that balance of, like, I love you.
I need you.
Like, I want to Foster you, I want to grow you.
But there are expectations and after a certain point it goes from love to fear.
Right?
19:07
There are going to be teeth that come out as a result of this relationship.
And if you can't do that, then that's when you lose respect, right?
From that.
Team of that employee, Etc.
And so, it's this, it's this Triad, and there may be even more Dimensions to it.
19:24
I don't know.
This is just like, as I'm articulating it because I know that I've had a lot of people ask me about it.
And it's Just such a complex emotion to be able to get from people and I don't think it's one trick because if it were, everyone would do it.
But I think it's like kind of the embodiment of all of the way that you treat other people in the things that you do in the dark, how you articulate those things and honestly, how you live your life.
19:47
And so when people want to have like I think the combination of perfect leadership and have the Loyalty in The Obedience and the sacrifice and the love and the fear and the respect from their team so that they can ultimately lead and influence an And it's because they lack some of those things, right?
20:03
Like you won't have fear if you never hold people accountable or enforce rules for real, right?
If you don't enforce then you have no fear, which is important because that's what moves people, right?
If you don't care for the individuals, right?
You'll lose loyalty because they think that you don't actually care about them.
20:21
And it's only about you or it's only about the business which means that the first chance and they're going to go care about themselves and not you, or the business because they're just going to mirror back.
So, what what?
You're showing them, right?
And then the same thing with respect, which I think a lot of times comes from sacrifice, right?
20:39
Is that if they feel like you're not willing to do things for the organization that you're asking them to do then they're not going to do it for the organization either.
Right.
And I think that to a certain degree, a lot of people like I've always felt like it was easier to ask someone to do something that they know beyond a shadow of a doubt.
20:57
I would do five times more.
Right?
And then it just it just gives you a high ground from that conversation and maybe there's other ways to do it.
Like I mean, I don't know but at least for me from my life up to this point in my life.
I know that I can speak confidently and saying that most people in the organization.
21:15
Don't think that I slack, right?
They don't think that.
I hope that I would hold myself to a lower standard than I would hold them.
And so I think that that's one of the keys is like if you want to hold people to a high standard Heard a really high standard, then you in honest or in Earnest, have to hold yourself to an even higher standard and that has to be real.
21:37
And that means that like that video that I made about trade-offs of like, well, if you're going to hold some this standard and you want to hold yourself to a higher standard, are you being real about that?
Is that actually the standard you're holding yourself to and if you're not then that's where they lose respect.
Because the moment you ask more from someone else than you ask him yourself.
21:53
You lose respect, right?
And so if it's like man, it seems so hard to balance all these things.
I think it's true, it's right that Is hard and that's why most people can't do it.
And that's why most people don't lead right and the degree to which you lead and the size of the organization that you're able to lead her to the size of the movement that you're able to lead.
22:10
I think, is directly proportional to how deep each of those three roots of the triangle run, right?
How, how hard do people think you can go from a fierce?
I'd like how much Judgment Day do they think that you can, you can dish out if it came to it, how much Sacrifice from the respect side?
22:29
Do They think that you would give to, to better the entire Community to better the entire organization.
What would you give up for?
Not your own self-interest, but for the good of the whole, right?
Like when we talk to our generous community and I say like, we haven't taken a paycheck and we're putting everything into building what we think is going to be the future of the gym industry.
22:50
Like it's not semantics like we're doing that and it's not doing it to gain respect, it's doing it, because I think that's what's right?
And I think that we've been given a lot and to be Words of that, I want to whom much has been given much is expected and I think we've been given a shitload so that there's a lot of expectation, right?
23:10
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it, share it on Instagram or something like that.
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
23:29
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
And if you feel like someone else above you is always expecting more from you than anyone else, right?
And you think about all the things that were given?
I think it shifts your perspective in terms of what is expected of yourself.
23:47
And so that allows you to raise the bar beyond what most humans will be able to be capable of because it's not from here, right?
If that makes sense.
And so the last piece is, is the love peace.
And so how deep does your love run right for the individuals that are in your organization?
And I think that comes from like Truly loving people, but truly loving people isn't being soft.
24:07
Your I mean, it's knowing the difference of like is this the type of person has everyone here who has kids and I don't have kids but I know that I'm probably going to bother them this way is like there's like I have some like the sales team responds very differently than then you know, then marketing very different, you know, very I've got a bunch of, you know, more creative people there and like, Like they're not the type of people that need, like fear, you know what I mean?
24:38
Because they're like sales people.
In general tend to be more Alpha, more pushing the envelope always.
And that's good because it's what they need, they need that characteristic in order to succeed, right?
But in order to run that team, it needs a very different leader and leadership style than running a marketing team, right?
24:53
Which have you have to fuck.
Like you can't have a lot of creativity in an environment of fear, right?
And so, it's balancing the needs of the individual and deeply caring about.
Them in reality because you want what's best for them.
And sometimes it's best for them is not working for your company and being honest about that with them.
25:12
So it's like I care about you and in this point in your life you may or may not believe me.
But I know that later on you may gain the perspective to see what I'm doing right now and you'll thank me for it.
And I can't tell you how many times I've had that conversation with people and then later had them come back and be like, You were down on like I wasn't ready for that at that point.
25:32
And I just want to say thanks and and and I think is leader, you have to be willing to not be liked in the moment to do what's right in the larger sense for the individual.
And sometimes it's doing things that they don't even understand themselves.
And sometimes that the eyes, um, out and I think in context of like the things that I've suffered through in my life and thought, In this moment.
25:53
Or in that moment, I was I struggled a ton with it, but then, it made me stronger, right?
Was it like it either, either like struggles, either beat the strength out of you or beat it into you.
I kind of like that saying and so I think that when you think about those in context, they make us, you know, those experiences make us who we are.
26:12
And if we're going to be the person who's delivering those experiences to someone else, you have to do it from a position of Love of truly, loving the person.
And what you we hope that they can become whether it's with you.
Without you and so that's it's like that's the that's the Triad right?
That's the Triad between those three things so that you can have the love, the respect and the fear of all of the people in your organization so that you can have the loyalty and the sacrifice.
26:36
And the you I don't like the word obedience because I think it has a very negative connotation but like in a lot of ways like the word is obedience.
Like it's you know when you have you have a directive like it needs to be followed, right?
And so maybe a better word would be like buying, you know?
26:52
I mean I would probably Like the socially accepted word, but like, I like the word obedience because I think, I think it carries, it's real.
You know what I mean?
It's real, and a lot of a lot of obedience also comes from, like I respect you enough.
I admire you enough, I admire your achievements, I admire what you're willing to give up that I will take what you See and understand that, I don't see the whole playing field, right?
27:16
Which is why I was really drawn to the military and it was a really hard decision and ultimately both my parents.
Like you know, like we don't want you to go there like they had all their fears and all that stuff, but I think I really would have loved the military to be honest with you but I just ended up not doing that.
27:32
Direction modified have a tremendous amount of respect for it and in those organizations, It's so indoctrinated in so clear to everyone that like you don't see the greater good, you don't see the whole Battlefield right?
27:47
You see your piece and you need to execute and then when that happens the whole is better and that's why military organizations are run off respect right and loyalty because in sacrifice and and and so that like those those characteristics are more life because it's mostly a male organization and they understand it better than anyone is that What runs that then write that whole organization is run off respect.
28:12
And so anyways to Circle this whole thing back.
If if you were trying to lead and you're struggling to lead and you're struggling to get the respect and ultimately The Obedience in the execution, in the buy-in from your team.
When you need to make the hard calls about the business or about changes that happen, look at those three and think, which of these am I lacking am I lacking the enforcement from the fear side?
28:38
If I set expectations and said, this is where we need to go and then not follow through and not had repercussions when we didn't hit it.
Did have I have I have, I been asking so from a respect standpoint, have I been asking things of other people that I wouldn't do myself or that?
They don't believe that I would do myself.
28:54
Am I like am I willing to sacrifice or asking them to sacrifice things that I'm not sacrificing for respect for love?
Do the people that are in my realization feel like I genuinely care about them in a deep sense, not on a peripheral coddling sense.
But like, really truly care about the individual, which sometimes means doing things that aren't fun for them because you care about their greater good and not just a moment.
29:16
And so I think that, if you look at those three things, you'll be able to dissect your leadership style and be able to see where the deficiencies are in where you have, and then kind of go through that, respect Playbook to get to where you want to go.
So, anyways, I hope this is available for you.
29:31
This is just like, I this Melting Pot of all these different concepts in my head.
That that kind of Of came together to this, you know, if you found this valuable, throw like for a comment, I'd love to have your opinion.
If you like some of this stuff or like, like more of this kind of Direction, I don't talk about leadership a ton, I talk way more about like, you know, business and money stuff.
29:51
But I think that it's important and I think that it underlies being able to execute anything is because after it's not you anymore and you have a team, then you have an entire team of people that you have to get to do what is best for the business.
And the way to do that is through leading.
So anyways, lots of Everybody.
30:08
Hope you have a terrific Thursday.
Like I said, drop a like and a comment or tag somebody if you think it's good and if you're listening to the podcast, leave a review.
That'd be great.
All right.
Easy.









0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else but everyone happy Saturday who you guys are.
Starting your weekend off.
It's rocking and rolling.
As I feel like, I have started super early today with the intention of crushing and I'm going to send some productivity vibes your way.
That being said, I had a piece of cotton that I wanted to make and if there's just been a couple different ideas, bouncing around and it's been about money.
0:47
So I'll talk about money in a while and it felt like the right time.
And so this is a bit of a prediction that I think's going to happen for 2020.
So one of the things that we recently, you know, discovered or put together is As we have our hybrid model.
So if you've been following us on any Social Media stuff or me at all, you see it, we've been talking a lot about it, but it's basically a new gym model and so it essentially reduces 3/4 the risk of owning a gym and exposes you to more upside from a revenue standpoint and then obviously, far more for poverty point.
1:18
So it's incredibly exciting because it's going to change the way.
It's just black and white mouth.
Like it's about a model.
Now that being said, here's why I'm trying to, I'm going to make a prediction about what's going to happen.
All of the gym owners.
Who switch over to this and who come into this world.
1:35
And I'll make far more profit are going to run into the limiting beliefs, they have around money because up to this point, they've been able to get by on, you know, making enough to survive, making enough to, you know, make be comfortable, whatever it is, right?
They get out of survival to to making it right, but they can't turn that next corner and because they start self-sabotaging.
1:58
And so my prediction is that we're going to have a ton of people come into real conflict.
With some limiting beliefs that they're carrying from their childhoods, from their upbringings, from whatever, whatever it is.
And so, I wanted to talk about a couple of things that have helped me related to that and Leila when we're at dinner last night, when I say at dinner, I mean at my own dinner table with my life with Layla.
2:20
She was talking about how when she met me.
I broke a ton of beliefs for her around money and that she was raised kind of, in a household of poverty.
In terms of poverty, thinking poverty mindset are on money, not Um like actually, you know, race and poverty.
But just like the way that everyone thought about money when people talk about money and so I want to share a couple things with you.
2:41
So one of the reasons is there going to be an unrelated but they're all going to relate to money.
So one of the reasons I think biblically and this isn't me saying that that's like necessarily your truth, whatever.
But I'm saying that giving is so big in.
Almost all religions is because I think that giving allows you to have a game outside the game.
3:01
What I mean by that, is that when you have a game outside of the game, it makes you realize that the the game we are playing the business game is just step one, right?
And then when you take that money, you enter, and like you buy your ticket into the next game.
And so, some of you may have heard of the four quadrants of wealth, right?
3:19
So first is you are an employee, so you have a job, right?
The next level is, you're self-employed.
So, you own a job.
The third level is you own a system right?
Which is a business, your business owner and then the fourth level is investor, right?
3:37
You're an investor.
And so now you own pieces of many businesses, right?
And so your money.
So the first two you trade time for money, the third one, you trade other people's time for money and then the fourth one you trade money for more money, okay?
And it's that sort of the quadrant, and so I get reached out to you by my own sales team.
3:53
I could've reached out to, by Gym owners were like, I, you know, what do, what do I do?
Like how do you stay motivated when you've made it?
And I always find that interesting because, like, everyone's definition, I'm making, it is very different.
You know, I've got some sales guys who are like, I've made it and they have 25,000 dollars in in student loan debt.
4:11
They've got 50 Grand in the bank account there.
Like, I've made it.
That's because that's their, that's their perceive reality.
You know what I mean?
And then other people who, you know, got zillions of dollars and feel like they never made it.
So everything is kind of a balance point but What happens is if you realize that the game you are playing this, not the end goal, you making a profit does not mean you win, it means you now bought your ticket to the next game that you are.
4:34
Now the small fish in that you are now just starting that you now just have training wheels for that's when you realize that there's a much bigger game that's at play, right?
And so like if all of us are after Freedom it's very difficult to have to own a business and I'm not saying it's impossible, I'm just saying it's very, very difficult to To have a long-term sustainable business that you are not involved in to like, that does not occupy your attention.
5:02
It's very, very low likelihood.
And so, for the most part, if you're a business owner, you are working and you're trading energy in some capacity to get money out of the business, but the ultimate goal is freedom, right?
Or fulfillment.
However, you busy, however, you define it.
But the goal is to is to be able to live life on your own terms.
5:18
And for me how to find that as temporarily in terms of time geographically, be wherever I want.
Then monetarily do whatever I want, right?
So I can afford to do whatever I want whenever I want where I want.
And so those are kind of the different, you know, capacities of Freedom that I sought out when I started the business.
5:34
And so that's where kind of the fourth quadrant of wealth feeds in.
Because now, your money is making you money.
And so then, at that point, you can actually be free.
Now, if you weren't aware of that game, that you're only between Step 2 and step 3, then you would realize that there's a lot more game to play.
5:51
And so, when you're like, I don't know how I'd like, how can you be?
Dated it's like dog.
You're halfway through like and the last two are the hardest levels together.
So like you got through level 1 and you're a level 2 like cool like you still have two more levels you know I mean or whatever it is and so just understanding that piece is I think a really important component.
6:11
The next one is and you guys have heard me talk about this but for some people for people who have families or people who have you know wives whatever the game outside of the game for them is that they have to provide right which is People who have families, make more money.
Right sales guys who have more mass than me, make more money.
6:29
Why?
Because they have to, because their game outside of the game is bigger than the single guys.
But if you're the single guy, how can you make your game outside of the game bigger than the family man's, right?
Because both of you are just making enough money to, to, to meet requirements.
6:45
It's just that the requirements of the family man are higher than the single man, right?
But if the requirements you have, and this is where I'm going to looping back to giving is that you're trying to give into something that's much bigger than you.
Then what you create is an unlimited requirement and so when you have an unlimited requirement or unsay, Chabot requirement that you have to meet right.
7:05
A need that can't be met.
Then you create a demand for money that can't be met and that's what ultimately breaks, you free from the being satisfied with how much you make, right?
Hey guys, love that.
7:20
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, And so, you know, if we you see us give there's there's a definitely a part of me that knows that when I give I'm giving because I'm expanding what I believe I'm connecting into so that I can tap into a bigger network of something that's much bigger than me so that I can fill that or I can create a bigger vacuum of like, man.
7:55
We gotta go back to the well, like, we got to go to work and we have to like, we have to renegotiate, our rates with vendors.
We have to push harder.
We have to grow right from, from the, from NS, from the business side, rather than from the impact side.
Right?
So there's both sides, be motivated by like can get Mission driven.
8:11
In terms, of fact of like us, I want to save James, Olmos save the industry.
I want to do all these these things to help everyone who's on here out, you know what I mean?
Like and I get a ton of fulfillment from knowing that like we're setting other people free.
I do believe that and I feel them.
But on the flip side from the business side how can I how can I also create a vacuum so it's both sides, not just Mission but also from the business side from the Alex selfish side.
8:32
How do I how I tap into that?
And so tapping into that is like I'm gonna I'm gonna double down on our marginal Down on on being efficient, I'm gonna double down on all these different aspects of the business because we owe it to the mission that were that were attacking to be profitable to make money so that we can give more, right?
8:51
And so that's why I think people who give more make more.
It also makes you feel good, which is nice, you know what I mean?
But I've heard that I've heard this statement, like anybody who says money can't buy, happiness, hasn't given enough away.
And I kind of like that.
I think he's, I think it's worth worth giving a shot.
9:07
So you can An.
But, um, but anyways, so that's, that's kind of my prediction overall is that a lot of people, once all of the obstacles of making money have been removed from them?
Because the things that we have coming out on in hybrid or just are just sick?
You know, I mean, like all of the biggest pain points and all of the biggest mobsters and most people have from lead generation to like, say Ln from getting people in the door to having a strong sale, having a great offer, all of those things we've like really really taken care of.
9:36
And so there's just going to be people who are in a Nicolette so effective at making money and making profit that they're going to have like they're going to have to deal with some of their own demons.
Because up to this point, they haven't had to because they've been able to focus or get distracted by other shit.
But now you're going to come face to face with the fact that you have a limiting belief set.
9:52
This whole time I've been underneath sabotaging you because you don't believe you deserve to be rich or because like if you say I want money you feel weird about it.
And so this is a fun exercise for you.
If you have like family members who, you know, are super about of money in like, why do you want to make all this money, where you, some motivate, all that kind of crap, right?
10:13
Ask them, like ask them to repeat, like I want to be powerful, you know?
I mean, if you say that someone and they're like, I don't want to say that.
I'm like, why not, right?
Power isn't good or bad, it's neutral.
It's just potential energy, right?
Money isn't good or bad.
It's just potential energy.
10:29
Money, builds hospitals, money builds wells in Africa, money.
Prevents HIV.
Money is what drives all of these things, right?
He does good things.
So does power, right?
And so to say that you don't want money or that wanting money is bad.
10:45
Is like saying you don't want to make an impact that you don't want to have more leverage and people to help more people because like no matter what like anyone's excuse is bullshit because what they do is they do that so that they can excuse themselves from trying, right?
They cannot feel bad about themselves for not for not succeeding, right there.
11:01
Like, well, you know, you shouldn't want money.
Because money.
Why are you talking like, cool?
Good luck, man, like, good luck doing anything with your life.
Life.
Right?
I'm just being real.
This is just me off the cuff and so it's learning that the game is a lot bigger than you because until you do, you'll never be able to make more than what you were, what is required for you live.
11:21
And that might not be able to, because most of us don't really need that much.
I mean, I don't need that much.
I like, we did our bills Leyland, I live on nine thousand dollars a month.
You might be like, well, that's a lot.
It's like, well, it's during comes rolling up.
Like, we don't need a lot, but if you don't need a lot then, like even After you've hit your retirement goal enough money, that you're good for, you're set for life, right?
11:43
Then, how do you get motivated?
It's got to be something bigger than you, right?
And you have to create a vacuum and learn that there's a game beyond the game.
And so that's kind of the the, the moral of the message.
If there's a moral of the messages, like One identify what like the issues are that are holding you back.
12:02
Like if you can't say, I want money and it doesn't make you feel weird.
Like, if it does, make you feel weird, then you've got stuff there, you got to figure it out.
I want power, I want to be powerful.
Like, if you can't say that, like, you've got stuff there, you gotta you gotta unpack, right?
And so, if you can say those things and you can believe those things, then you'll have the things that come with that, right?
12:23
And you'll be able to move through level 1 level 2 level 3 level 4 because You'll realize that it's not about this game, like just getting the business profitable is the beginning, right?
Like that's real, like I had my first month of profit.
Now, do I do, I'm like, you keep making money.
That's what you do, like every.
12:39
Like I can't tell you how many times I've seen gym owners who make their first two months of profit.
They're like, okay, what I do now and like you keep doing it, you keep making money and because the thing is, is the goal for them was to make money.
The goal wasn't to have money.
12:56
Say it again, the goal for so many people is to make money but the goal was never to have money and so they continue to just keep trying to make money.
Make money because that was the goal rather than having money.
And so, once they go becomes having money, then you can start moving to level 4, right?
13:15
And then you realize that you have so little money when you start making money that you're like, oh crap, I need to make more in order to give use this money to make more money so that I can eventually lead to Freedom that I set out to get So anyways, guys, hope you have an amazing Saturday.
Just thought I would give you my two cents on that because it was on mine and had a couple conversations about it but 20s me interesting we have some real real belief breaking that's going to happen which to me.
13:43
Cool, I mean I'm stoked for it.
That's why I had to roll hybrid out with coaching because like there's so many times where like you really are you sure I'm like, yeah I'm sure like yep, you'll make four times more money.
It's like I don't know if I'm prepared for that.
I like I think.
I'm just going to keep the overhead and like, okay, cool, but you're choosing to make less money.
14:00
Like as long as you're aware of it, you're choosing actively to make less and expose yourself to more risk there.
Like, like I would like, you see, people like freeze up like that, that's beliefs being broken, that's beliefs coming in contact with reality, that's different.
And so you're breaking what they believe their whole life that has created this shell around them, that gave them Comfort, but it was false Comfort, it was false Comfort because it was just, what was just what they knew.
14:23
It.
Didn't mean it was safe, right?
A lot of people who grew up in abusive, Households, go back to abusive households because they're comfortable there.
It doesn't mean it's if, right, this is difference.
So, anyways, again, hope you guys have an awesome Saturday.
If you found this valuable, drop a like, drop a comment, all that kind of stuff, and I will catch you on the flip side.









0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
What's going on?
Everyone have the Tuesday.
Hope you guys have been rocking and rolling Tuesday.
Start to the week.
I wanted to make this about.
I've had I've had many lessons over the last six months or whatever month it is for 2019.
0:38
And I wanted to share one of them are particular with you because it kind of came up fresh today.
And so I'm just calling this, no half measures.
And so one of the lessons that I've learned and I feel like I can, I repeatedly learned and I learned in different situations is the power of going all-in and cutting your ties.
0:54
Burning your boats.
And so right now obviously, you know, we've talked about hybrid, And the new model that's coming out and I want everyone to know and I'm saying this half to my audience as well as half, the people who don't know who you are, that it's scary when you make changes, right?
1:14
And the time to make changes is not when your back is against the wall, right?
When the stock market is going, well, is the time that no one wants to sell, right?
That's when no one wants to sell and then it crashes.
And then that's when everyone, One wants to get out and they lose everything, right?
1:33
And so like the cost of having for state of having vision of seeing, what's going to come, is the courage to break something that isn't broken and sacrifice.
Good for great.
Right?
That's the sacrifice to sacrificing.
1:48
Good for great.
It's sacrificing comfort for more, right?
And it's almost like a spiritual experience, like you have to, you have to the old must die for the new to live, you know?
Like you can Do this half-assed.
If you want to commit to something, you have to go all in.
2:03
And so like for us at Jim launch, like I told our entire team, I was like we are going all in on this like like and that's the job of the CEO.
That is, your job is to look at your team even when they think you're crazy and say, like this is where I believe we are going.
This is where I believe the market is going.
2:21
And for these reasons that support this decision, this is what makes sense and this is where we're going to go.
And there are short periods of discomfort that follow those types of decisions.
That ultimately grow you and will grow your business and when you endure through those you will break through the other side.
2:37
Now the amount of people who laughed at people in 2007, right right before the crash were like I think things are going to happen, like I'm selling everything, they're like you're going to miss out.
This thing's a bull market.
We're going like this right.
Those guys seem like fools accept a year and a half later when everyone had lost everything, right?
2:56
And so I'm telling you right now that the market for Adams is about to contract, right?
The market for large group training, specifically is about to contract already happening, right?
You look at like, in the stock market, there's a whatever I want to be getting this up, but like, there's there are leading indicators right?
3:15
There are more genes that are closing than our opening right now.
Hmm why?
Right?
Because in a competitive Marketplace, once there are too many players in the marketplace, it begins to contract, price, pressures, increase, and drive down pricing, and commoditization.
Increases which means it's harder and harder and harder to compete offering an equivalent service right.
3:35
And when profits go down or pricing gets driven down profits, almost disappear and that is why people start going under, okay, so how do you how do you combat against that?
It's not incremental changes.
It's not like it's not it's not like not 1.1 1.2 1.3, it's not incremental changes.
3:50
Its massive changes.
Its 120 or 021.
New things new models that are going to have to emerge from this, right?
And so I'm saying this because like we at Jim launch, as of 628 are not going to be selling, Jim Lunch anymore, right?
4:08
We are not even doing Legacy anymore.
Everything is all in on hybrid, right?
Because I believe through and through that, this is where everyone needs to go.
And I also believe that in 24 months, people will look back.
And I'm going to have these videos saying that this is what's with the new models, were they, right?
4:26
And this, like the people who get in now are the ones who are going to to be able to ride the ride.
That no one else is going to be able to do because they were afraid and then everyone was going to try and come in and copy.
After we have yanked, all of the Prophet, we've done that dominated all of the market share with this, right?
4:42
And so like my I beseech you right.
I'm begging you for your own.
Good do not go half in.
There are no half measures.
You can't half and Pregnant.
Someone you can't half.
Marry someone right?
Like you can't dip your toe in the water.
It does not work that way.
4:58
Like it requires burning your boat.
Oats and making the full decision all in on what you believe is, right?
And what is right?
A lot of times is not what's popular.
And it's not what's easy, it's easy to do nothing, it's easy to stay the same, it's easy to stay comfortable, right?
5:14
But the thing is so many people.
Stay comfortable, stay where it's easy.
Stay in the road that is trodden, right?
That is has been walked up and those are the people who find themselves in the same boat as everyone else, right?
And so it's like I want to, I want to achieve what?
5:30
No one else is achieved and have to do the things that no one else has done, right?
Or no one else is willing to To do and more times than not, it's fear, it's pure fear.
And so what I will beseech you to do is that you have to walk through the logical outcomes of what happens.
5:45
What happens next, right?
What are my fears, right?
You have to paint out your worst case scenario.
Hey guys real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
6:01
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build High.
Up for under million-dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
Its fo free in exchange for your email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller leads and so that you can not miss out on it because last time I sold out for like eight straight weeks really fast.
6:24
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
And Leland.
I go through this exercise all the time whenever we make a big pivot, right?
Mind you when I, when we just made this change, right?
And it's we're in the in the middle of it and on 628 will be 100% done.
6:41
But like I am taking a 25% hit on my cash flow significant, right?
Businesses don't run on hundred percent margins, right?
So right now, if you think about your business, if you took 25 percent of our gross revenue, you kept your cost the same what happened?
You probably would make less, you might even lose.
6:57
Is money.
Why would I make such a drastic decision?
Because I'm all-in, right?
Because I believe that the truth will always win at the best model will always win period, just given time, right?
And so that is, that is mine.
There's my my word for everybody days, like, no half measures if you're making a change, go all in, don't let it be incremental.
7:19
Don't dip your toe in.
Don't say, I'm not really sure because when that happens, you will not succeed and you guarantee it, right?
And then you start to tell yourself the story of like, Well, you know, maybe it just wasn't for us or something like that, right?
You tell yourself that story but he's because you did not go all in, you won't happen and that is why you do not succeed.
7:38
So like, you have to be willing to burn your boats.
You have to be willing to make a sacrifice.
You have to be like to have hard conversations with your staff with your clients, with yourself with your spouse because that isn't what's required, not what's desired, but what is required to get to where you want to go?
All right, sorry, well feeling today.
7:53
So anyways, I hope you guys are having a great start, you know, to your week.
Week.
Maybe look at some of the things that you've been putting off that, you know, where the right decisions and not doing them.
Because I can tell you, like, they only, they don't go away, they don't go away, they come back and they bite you in the ass with the interest, right?
8:12
The more time you let something to do, let something not change that.
You should have changed.
Stay that way.
The bigger the bike gets so and that happens in stock markets that happens in real estate happens in business, right?
And so, right now, I'm telling you, this is where it's going, like, the market will change right now.
8:32
Lifetime Fitness is goals.
You know, 24 Hour Fitness all of them, have group training classes, with highly skilled trainers, because they're pulling from the same talent pool as we are.
But my community.
So great, everyone's is whenever you have humans in a room, you have a good Community, right?
As long as you're not a dick, right in the thing is, you're not even there your trainers.
8:50
Right?
So you're not even involved in it, right?
And that means that you have the exact same environment that they do.
Except they're offering parking.
Amenities pools, everything, right?
Better equipment.
And they're doing it in half to a quarter of the price that we are because they have the square footage in.
9:07
The can do that, right?
They have 10 million dollar facilities so how do you compete with that?
You do not you play a different game and that is why I'm so so passionate about this because I'm telling you, this is what's going to happen.
So anyways guys, I hope I hope I hope maybe one person hears this and decides to not not if they're Towing not think I'm not sure.
9:29
You know what I mean?
Sounds like a big change, it is huge, its massive change, its enormous, it's entirely new way.
A new core offer a new way of doing business, right.
It's a new way to do business for me, entirely entirely new.
I don't need to do this.
You know what I mean?
Like, I don't need to do this.
9:46
But if I stay awake at night and I think to myself, what do we stand for, what I want my life to be about?
Then then you're left with no other option, right?
And then you take yourself down the logic bathroom.
Like well then, I guess the only thing I have to do is you have to change, right?
10:02
We got to go over dot.
If we say that's our core tenant, then we gotta walk it right?
And growing you're dying is painful right.
Dying too painful to and so is growth, both are painful it's just which kind of pain do you want, right?
So anyways have an amazing day guys.
I hope this inspires somebody who's delaying a decision that you need to make, maybe you need to let a trainer go, right?
10:23
Confront it, no half.
Measures.
Don't try and weed off confront, right?
Maybe it'll climb sucks, right confront?
No half measures, right?
You have to, you have to make a change.
You got to cut classes, right?
Do it.
Make the change.
All right.
No one's gonna wait for you.
10:39
It's just going to it's going to build up with interest and the each you weigh down the road.
When it's a monster with huge, a steam, I'd rather kill a little dragon that a bit.
All right, easy as get you later.
Measures.
Don't try and weed off confront, right?
Maybe it'll climb sucks, right confront?
No half measures, right?
You have to, you have to make a change.
You got to cut classes, right?
Do it.
Make the change.
All right.
No one's gonna wait for you.
It's just going to it's going to build up with interest and the each you weigh down the road.
When it's a monster with huge, a steam, I'd rather kill a little dragon that a bit.
All right, easy as get you later.

Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out, if that's what you are into.
0:16
And if not keep enjoying the show, go on the happy Tuesday, turn down Tuesday, Tech Tuesday, whatever your choose dates are for you.
That is what they are for us here.
At Jim launch, I wanted to take today, it's been up in a hot second side mayday.
Podcast.
We've just been busy in Santa's Workshop putting together a hybrid and all the cool stuff that's coming out soon.
0:37
But coming off our quarterly meet up which is where we have all of our directors fly out so that we can meet in person, there were some really interesting things that are kind of wanted to feel like that they crystallized over the over the span of the week that we were together.
Kind of planning everything that needed to happen and I thought I would share it with you.
0:56
For when you're either doing your quarterly sore, you were deciding what to do with your team.
And this also sprung, from several conversations.
I had with some gym once you reached out unrelated just business stuff and they're like, man, I got so much stuff.
I'm trying to figure out what to do.
And so, after everyone had kind of given their presentations for our quarterly, I kind of just wrote up on the board, because I simply don't have goals because most of the girls get taken by the team.
1:25
And so, I said, listen guys.
Like these are the only four numbers that I care about, right?
Right.
And everyone after me saying these four numbers, I was like, I wish you had said that in the beginning because we would have routed our roles that way and I probably would have reprioritize things and so hopefully, I can share.
1:41
I can save you guys some time and maybe you can think about what your numbers are.
But I'll tell you what, ours were or the what mine were and then how you can help use those to cut out the noise and make decisions.
So, for example, I get tons of retards of like, I think I should do this, right?
1:57
I think, you know, I've got this trainer issue.
I've got this.
Gerace, you have got this client, who's annoying?
I've got this, whatever it is, right, or I've got this priority and I've got ten things, I need to do and I only have time to do two of them, right?
And that's that's like every entrepreneurs dilemma.
We always do it since the beginning of time.
And so basically, if you understand what the four lenses are, then you can make all these decisions and you can have absolute peace about it.
2:19
And then also your staff can use those as their kind of Guiding Light, right?
So this isn't the core tenants in terms of how we make decisions, promote and fire people.
But how do we, how do?
We zoom in on what needs to happen and cut out everything else.
Okay?
And so the four, the four numbers that I'm looking at.
2:36
And all of the activities that I'm tracking our team and myself towards R1 e, creasing opportunities.
How can we increase opportunities, right?
And if you think about that, from every aspect of your business, right?
This is where it's going to get good.
2:52
So, if you think about this from Every After of your business, you've got your trainers.
You got your front desk, you've got your sales managers, all that stuff, right?
If each one of them can answer you, how they increase opportunities for the business, then, everyone is a focused on doing one thing which is growing it, but be knowing what they can specifically.
3:09
Do to get more, get more options for the business.
And it gets really interesting when you ask people who are not in you know the sales will go sales easy, okay I can ask for referrals right?
Okay great.
What else can you do?
You don't I mean I guess I could be posting.
Okay cool.
What else can we do right?
I should always put the link that great.
3:25
We charge them a call to action for all the posts we do as a community.
Okay?
Great.
And so when you start asking the questions directed towards the kpis that you have is the owner.
A lot of people don't even know what your kpis are and it seems obvious to you because it's all you think about, right?
But for people who are in your team, it won't be obvious, right?
3:40
And so, just not only saying it once the saying repeatedly in that having them tie their goals to them, we'll just make a huge amount of difference for you and then, because for you, you're like great these.
Now, everyone's doing the stuff that I, that I want so that they can grow the business.
And then you were happy and they're happy because you are happy, right?
3:55
Because that's most people on the team.
Just want to do a good job, right?
When people don't do a good job, it's usually not because they have malicious intent or lazy.
It's just because they just don't know what you want, right?
So first one is increasing opportunities.
The second one is increasing closing percentage right now that factors in lead, nurture and sales, but it's just kind of one percentage number that you can focus on, right?
4:17
And so how do I increasing, how do I increase the closing percentages?
That we have.
Right?
What are all the things that we can do now?
When you look at that?
That's like how do we do this?
You know, the how do we greet people?
The moment, they enter the Or how do we set up our sales room?
Like, what are the offers?
What are the price points, what?
4:33
You know, how can we drill this?
Write all of these types of things.
You know, what's our nurture process?
We get more people schedule, more people to show, right?
All of those things would be the things that are going to increase closing percentage, right?
And you can see just from the first two, it's like, how do we increase the amount of inflow and then how do we capture more of that inflow makes sense, right?
4:49
The third one is.
How do we keep churn below X?
Right?
So for the gyms is below three percent, okay?
So how do we get it?
And keep it there indefinitely.
Right?
What are all the things that we can do in order to do that?
5:05
And then, once you think of all of the things, from every different perspective in the business, not just your perspective, as the owner.
But how does, how can the trainer cut turn, right?
How can the front desk person cut turn?
How can the billing person cut turn?
How can all of these roles that you have in your business?
How can they specifically cut?
5:22
Turn from their angle, right?
And so when you get people thinking about that honestly, are you get tons of creative responses from it?
I'm that you probably didn't even know existed and you're like, oh, wow!
This is super, super useful, right?
But having that, this is, as the third number, if you think about the flow of the business, if you can increase the amount of people, you know, signing up, op, you know, opting in to do stuff with you.
5:44
And then increase the percentage that you capture.
The only thing that you're looking at.
After that it's like, okay, cool.
I turned on a flood, but if we're not keeping them, then it doesn't matter.
But if I can increase opportunities, increase closing percentage, and then keep my churn below X that we can scale to the Moon, right?
And so those become your three kind of kpis that you want to track.
6:04
And then also make sure that you're tracking your team towards.
And then when they make their goals for the quarter, when they make their goals for the month, it's not just like, oh, this would be nice, wouldn't this be cool?
I think we should do why?
But you can be at.
You can has targeted questions of like, how is that going to increase these four numbers, right?
6:21
How's it going to do that?
And if they can't answer it, well, right?
Or convincingly, then you can just say we're not going to do that.
Hey Mose, a nation quick break.
Just to let you know, we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright so send me a connection request.
A note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
6:39
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
Right?
And that's it.
And then it takes things off of your to-do list, that never ends because you're like, that's just not going to do it nearly as much as this is right.
6:57
If you had to bet your child's life on, which one of these things is going to increase, which one would you do?
Right?
Then people.
Prioritize the things that actually matter and are actually going to grow those kpis, right?
So the first three, the last one is finance-related, which is just profits, which is how can we increase our profit margin?
7:16
What are the things that we can do to decrease costs in the business?
Right?
Right?
And ideally decreasing cost from things that don't provide value or don't provide asymmetric returns in value, right?
So, an example of that might be something that you put a dollar of time and attention into, but only yields fifty percent fifty cents of value, right?
7:35
That's where you get uneven exchanges where you're like, maybe there's a return but maybe it's not a proportional return to the amount of time and effort that you're putting into it.
And that's a really, really big one because there's a ton of things that we can do to increase.
Is the business, right?
7:50
Tons there's a million things, you can sit on the sidewalk with sign it.
I mean it's not going to hurt your business, right?
But in terms of the time and attention that it takes to do that, what other things could we do with that same time and attention and could we get disproportionate Returns on that using that method, right?
8:07
And so, when you're analyzing all of the goals, and this is because this is kind of like my big summary of our quarterly meet up and I hope it's useful for you.
But those are my four numbers that I told our team is like everything that we do is it.
Company, everything that your departments do, whether it's HR, whether its billing, whether it's fine, you know, Finance, whatever it is right, it should be going around these four numbers, okay?
8:28
And all of the goals that you guys have all written down of the things that you want to do in this company, should Trek back to these four things.
If you can't demonstrable, you show me how it's going, how it's going to increase one of these four things or improve one of these key metrics.
Then cross it off.
I'm sure it might be nice but cross it off because it's not gonna grow the business, right?
8:48
And so it gives you laser-like And you'll also notice that if you're looking at your own day-to-day tasks, you're going to think Hmm.
One of the things that I have are not going to grow these four things, maybe, you know, lamenting that your trainer left right or being upset that, I mean, there's a million things that take up our attention as business owners, that do nothing for us, right?
9:09
And this kind of just takes the emotion out of it, it says, which of these things is going to relate to the fork apis, right?
And a follow-up.
The to follow up questions are once you have something that you think, Think yes, it relates to that kpi the follow-up is okay.
How much would that cost me time and attention.
9:25
And what else could I do with that?
Same amount of time and attention?
That might increase it more.
And that gets you really creatively thinking, because it gives you a tangible amount of time and attention that you can then reallocate, your creative juices towards not.
Like, let me solve this problem.
But what else could I do with five thousand dollars and forty hours of?
9:42
Someone's time to increase this more, right?
And so it allows you to think creatively less the team to think creatively.
And and I mean, for me, at least most importantly, it's just allows you to cut out the noise, right?
Because there's so many things that you feel like you should do.
That's why?
We're, there's always more work to do, right?
9:58
Is the best like things can always get better.
Nothing's ever perfect business, will never be perfect.
And so there's always things to do, but the question is always, which one should I focus on first, right?
And so, figuring out what your four key metrics?
Aren't those are mine right now.
And in priority for me, I have because of the stage of growth that we're in.
10:18
Our profitability is not as important to me.
It's just top-line.
Revenue growth is because I've reinvested more of it into growing, and that was a decision.
I made after we had enough money.
That I was like, we're good.
But that being said, for the first seven years of business, for me, it was 100% focused on profit and so that's why having context in terms of how you're making decisions.
10:40
You, don't always want to take the money, you know, I mean, because I might be doing something with different priorities than you.
But for the most, the most part, most people, most of the time prior, Resizing profit over growth is going to be a good idea most times for a small business and for me small business isn't a shot, it's like give a less than 100 employees.
10:58
That's the u.s. terms technicality of less than.
That's not a.
That's a not a medium sized business, a small business, less than 100.
So I say all this to say if you are not sure which of the many things you should do.
Look at your big for increasing opportunities.
11:14
Increasing closing percentages, decreasing turn, and increasing.
Profit.
Look at those four track back, all of the activities to those four.
And then specifically, if you know that there's one of them that is that is lagging on your metrics, then just laser focus on that and have everyone on your team.
11:31
Just focus on that one thing and go maintain on the other ones so that you can have a massive lever of growth, right?
And so that's all you doing these quarterly.
Meetups this is all your doing, your team meetings is assess where we're at assess where the weak points are and then Focus, everyone's attention on increasing.
That one thing, and when everyone has a clear Word of what they need to do to win and the activities that are associated with them.
11:52
Moving that big metric forward, you're going to be happy, they're going to be happy and you can cut out all the rest of the shit that is bugging you that you don't need.
So that is how to only do what matters.
And I think that this is like one of the most underrated aspects of being a business owner is being able to prioritize and decide what to do.
12:13
Everyone is given the same amount of time, write everything in the same amount of time and the same amount of resources that we start with, for the most part, right?
Not everyone, but a lot of people are given most people that are listening to this started with nothing, right?
Our nothing significant.
And so if everyone is given the same things to start, then why is it that some people Advance faster than others?
12:33
The only reason is because those people prioritize actions that are more linked, more directly linked to the key metrics that grow the business, right?
I can't tell you amount of times, I see people who like, Oxygen in.
Like, what's taking all your time?
Was taking all your attention and they list out 10 things that they're doing and I'm like, none of these things are going to grow your business, right?
12:51
If you took this 30 hours a week, what else do you think you could do with it?
Like?
Well, I guess you could put it like that.
I'm like, yeah.
I'm putting like that because that's ultimately, what grows everything.
And so ask those questions to your team as well so that they feel included and it's not just you always feeling you're driving.
The boat is like, did everyone see why these four metrics are?
13:07
The only thing that are going to grow our business, right?
And then, once you have those four metrics, what of all the things that we came up with today, are they me the ones that most move these metrics forward.
Like if we had to bet our child on it, which is the real one that we should focus on and then cut everything else away.
13:24
And if you have three of the four that you're doing well on or two of the four, then just focus your attention on the other two.
Right.
And I know that sounds simple but simple is the types of things.
It's so easy to do and it's even easier not to do right.
I think it's Jim Rohn, the easiest things to do in life that are like so easy.
13:40
To be successful are the things that are even easier not to do so.
Anyways, I hope you guys have a terrific Tuesday, tax confused, a turnout Tuesday, get shit, done Tuesday.
And if you are thinking about what to do, maybe figure out what your four metres aren't, those are mine for right now, and that's what I'm driving our whole company towards.
13:57
So anyways lots of love keeping amazing and I'll catch you guys on the flip side.0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually a pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
It was one.
Every one of you guys are having a sexy Saturday anyways, so it is 6:22 a.m. on Saturday here in Austin and I don't know, it's I feel like that the content inspiration this Wax and Wane died a couple weeks of not really make anything and then probably like four pieces, unless, two days.
0:38
So, this one is something that I've just been.
I don't know, it's been on the back of my mind.
And so, for those of you, this one is not going to be a tactical one in terms of how to make more money with your gym, but it may be something that just might make you.
0:53
I don't know feel less alone.
So I told it's going to be a happy CEO.
And I wanted, I think I'm half making this for me because I guess when I started out like my first gym, I thought that if I hit X I would be, I would, it would finally like be over, you know, I mean, the stress that I would have the anxiety levels that I would have about running a business, would be over once, I made extra Revenue once I just had another 50 customers.
1:24
And then what's interesting is that I feel like whenever you look at these milestones and maybe you were This when you started working out like it might have been a deadlift like man, when I did lift 315 when I did live 405, when I did lift 495 whatever it is, it's like that's then I'll be there, right?
And what's interesting is that as you approach those things, then, the actual goal that you previously said, once you get close to 405 and you actually deadlift 395 405 actually, doesn't seem that sexy anymore.
1:52
You don't.
I mean, it just seems like, well, it makes sense that I'd hit it because you know we're already here right?
And so I was having a conversation with Shawn Fynn ter, who had a restaurant group that did I think they did 50 million, something like that.
And now he helps restaurants, you know, basically do what we do with Jim lunch.
2:11
But he does that with restaurants and he was talking, we're having a really deep conversation and he's had some unbelievably hard things that have happened to him in his life, like things that I wouldn't wish on anyone.
And he was saying, I think that entrepreneurs, a lot of them tend to have come from stressful pasts and And so, we tend to be some of the only people who can deal with the stress and the consistent, consistent anxiety, that comes with running a business, right?
2:36
Because most people don't can't handle it, right?
It's just don't, or don't want to, you know what I mean?
And there's there's both sides of that.
And I think that like frost on the entrepreneurial Journey, like I just want everyone to know, like it doesn't end.
And so I guess the prerequisite for this is that if you desire to grow, The discomfort does not stop.
2:58
I am more uncomfortable now than I've probably been.
In a really long time, like my problem, I stress.
All those now are probably, like second-highest.
I would say they're they're not as high as when I opened the first facility but they are they're almost as high and it comes from an entirely different set of problems.
3:20
And so if you desire the continual growth which most of us do as entrepreneurs, then I think that we have to get out of this.
And I'm half saying this to myself to like remind myself of it, but like we have to get out of this.
This?
Like once I hit X, it'll be okay.
3:36
Once I hit why it's going to be okay.
And like, I spelled out the math, on one of the, one of the videos that I made about how, like, once you hit xampp like, you know, something like if I just hit a million dollars in my gym, then it'll be okay.
But the thing is is that if you run a business that has a 20% margin or 30% Mark, and whenever it is in order for you to hit the million dollars, you have seven hundred thousand dollars of liabilities and committed two hundred and fifty thousand dollars.
3:59
Then you know that if something went wrong with in, Four months, everything that you worked for the last year is gone.
It's depleted.
And the thing is is that that level just continues, you know what I mean?
If you make 10 million dollars you take home three million then you have seven million dollars of liability.
4:15
Which means that in five six months like everything that you could have worked for could be gone.
And so you know what I mean?
And so like that anxiety doesn't end.
And so I mean, one of the things I'm working on is, you know, as we continue to go up is like learning to try and try and quiet your mind.
4:33
And, you know what I mean?
And so like, can you be happy CEO?
I think what happens is, like, at least for me, I oscillate between being bored because the team needs to move forward, scale, Etc.
In order to execute the next thing, or there's a crisis, right?
4:50
And so I think, I think Rob, Brooklyn, he's out here said, he's like business is problems everyday punctuated by moments of Crisis.
And so which in some ways is really morbid when you think about it, but Um, I think that that's and so what happens is like if we actually do get to a point where like I don't know what to do, we usually thrust ourselves into a either, a new project to shiny object, right?
5:13
Or be we go in and bration, you know what I mean?
And that's because a lot of times, a lot of us came from adversity when we, you know, start out in life and in a weird way, we're comfortable in chaos and I think it's one of the things that makes, you know, entrepreneurs unique, but also it can be our downfall, is that?
5:30
Like sometimes we just shake things up.
And sometimes things don't need to be shook up and so like, can you be a happy CEO?
I don't have the recipe and I just want everyone to know that.
Like I don't I don't have it figured out.
5:47
I get stressed all the time.
I can use ID all the time when I read a comment that someone posts that's negative.
It'll ruin my day, like it will, you know, I try to say that it doesn't.
6:02
And I try to coach myself through like why like I, you know, I go through the same things.
I tell everyone like law, of large numbers.
If you have 1,000 clients, if you have two percent that are assholes, are two percent that are having a bad day, whatever you want to say, like that's 40 people, you know what I mean?
Or 20 people or 30 people, that would say something - just three percent people having a bad day.
6:21
And but the thing is, as the business grows like that percentage is a lot of things.
It's a lot of words, a lot of things. take your vitamins hit and so it's this balance that like at least for me, I continually try and strike between Rationalizing.
6:37
The, the big numbers of understanding that when you have a bigger business, there's going to be statistically.
Even, I mean, like, I feel like Elon Musk is like the coolest guy in the world is trying to save everyone.
You know, I mean, like being a good dude.
And he's like, and I listened to one is Joe Rogan podcast and he just looked.
6:53
He seem so stressed and I'm like, man, this guy is just trying to like, save humanity and like make a green plant and get us to Mars and like have electric cars and solar panel.
You don't, I mean like, he's so stressed.
You like hurting his breath, you know what I mean?
He's like no one would want to be me.
And I like, I like felt this like absolute like connection to the side.
7:10
Like, I get that.
You don't even like, it's stressful.
And so I just, I think part of me is saying, like, if any of you were like stressed and you're like, man, like when does the stress end?
I can tell you that, it doesn't end when you make more money.
I can't.
I mean, I'm just telling you from my just from where I'm at.
7:28
Now, I can tell you that it does not end.
When you make more money, I can tell you, that shit gets harder and you have to get better.
And so the level of discomfort that you're going as long as you, this is assuming this up, like, taking on the assumption that you want to grow and growth is your, you know, primary thing as a person.
7:47
But like, you're going to constantly put yourself in these situations that you're not comfortable in because you're not good enough, right?
What is required is higher than what your best is, which means that you need to improve your best, right?
And so, back to what I was saying before about, like having to balance, understanding that law of large numbers, is that there's going to be a certain amount of people.
8:06
No matter what you do, that will be you know, unhappy just like if you have like I said, give a thousand customers.
I mean, it's almost virtually impossible to get 1000 happy.
Days either amine.
But on the flip side, still taking absolute responsibility for anything that is negative that comes your way.
8:25
And so it's it's this balance of like, always wanting to maintain the open heart, so you can receive these hits.
You don't have met because like, in some ways I feel like I have to feel the hit.
I have to feel sad.
I have to feel angry about like angry at myself that I figured anyone else, but like angry about something that didn't go well, That someone said and balance that need to feel those emotions so that I can take action on it versus understanding that I can't always be upset, you don't know mean that things aren't going, fast enough to things aren't going and the things is like the problems that you experience when we go up.
8:59
So I'll tell you some of the things that I'm dealing with right now.
So I'm super excited.
We're going to we're going to be opening up the the gym wash Pearl has been 100% redone actually finished it six weeks ago but I had to go through.
Compliance and it's like, that's a new things that when you get bigger, like like all of the things that I do now have to go through a legal team and then they send everything back with edits and then I have to redo everything again.
9:25
And it, and then eventually, it's like, okay, I'm willing to take on x amount of risk to, you know, post it and, and it's exhausting, it's soul-crushing.
I like, I'm not gonna lie to you like it's fucking so crushing.
And like, for somebody who wants to solve problems quickly, it kills me and And you know on the flip side, if I want to like paint the picture of what is coming out next, right?
9:48
Like I so desperately want to tell everyone like the problems that you were experiencing more things that we are working on.
But whenever I give specifics my customer service director comes to me and she's like, dude, like all of our customer service getting blown up every single day since you made that thing, like, when is it happening?
When is it happening when it's happening?
10:04
And she's like, it's killing my team's morale.
And so it's like I have you don't mean like it's I think Ben, Ben Horowitz, wrote the book.
The hard thing about Things is that?
Like a lot of the decisions that we have?
Like, they're not, there's like, no, right answer, you know what I mean?
Like, there's no right answer.
10:20
And so and basically the discrepancy between like hard thing, one and hard thing to is like, you just feel stress, you don't mean, like, you feel like you take the slack between the decisions on his anxiety and I'm trying not to do that, you know what I mean?
10:38
I guess part of me is just making this to say that like like it literally, it does not end.
Do you know what I mean?
Like, it doesn't end like making more money.
Doesn't change anything?
The growing your business.
I mean, there's some gyms in here.
No, because they went from a solo operator to a seven-person team, you know what I mean?
10:56
They're like, man, sometimes I feel more stressed now and I'm like, believe me, I get it.
We have 120 employees, I get it, you know?
And but that's part of the it's just like you asked yourself, the question, do I want to grow?
And if the answer is yes and it means like then this is my path.
11:12
You know what I mean?
This is the this is the path that I'm going to take because Me being uncomfortable is the thing that's going to shape me into the person that I want to be, which is better than I was yesterday, right?
And so that's It's hard.
I'm just, I'm just making this to say that if anyone here is struggling like I feel like it's hard.
11:30
Like, there's a reason that most people don't get into business and there's a reason most people stay in it, right?
I think David Goggins was saying I saw went to the arcs I was at the Arnold because we're the title sponsor for the charity and today at this really think this back room where they did this award ceremony for the Hall of Fame.
11:47
So like Dave Magnus was there and like for other like unbelievable Champions that I should.
Remember the names of because they were all like super duper people.
But anyways, Dave Atkins had up there and spoken, he was like you know, like 80% of the people who drop out, who sign up to become a Navy, SEAL drop out on their own election.
12:05
They choose To leave and so they don't get kicked out.
They choose to leave and and I don't put me on the number, but it was a high percentage, you know, the guys who choose to leave.
And I just, like, I remembered that.
And, uh, speaking with Joe Huber yesterday because he was at our three-day quarterly and then he and I did a one day afterwards because we're planning out all the stuff that's coming up for the gym, which is really, really cool.
12:28
But he's like, I feel like it's just like, how much can you endure, you know?
And I don't know why that stuck with me.
But it's like It's in some ways, it's like you kind of have to see yourself as the boxer who look.
Either you can say like the one who gets knocked down and continues to get back up over and over and over.
You like Rocky in the movie or like just like how much punishment can you endure like trudging through the snow of like this journey and like the path to growth is an uncomfortable one.
12:51
I mean they call it growing pains for a reason you know?
Because like it's painful like it's like groans, not fun.
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to fifteen hundred dollars.
13:08
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
And so it's like we stuff elect to say like I want to grow and then in some ways were surprised when it's painful, right?
13:29
And so I guess I'm saying that have to myself is like I'm you know we want to grow me have this desire to change things and in order to change things when you to change who we are and it's not comfortable and so then, you know, we, you know, we take it out on our spouses, we take it out on our employees, we take it out on on and, you know, we just take it out, you know what I mean.
13:53
And we try not to and then we feel bad about the things that we said and things we did or how we said them or how we did them and and then we feel worse.
You know what I mean in real life?
You know, my messing this up so much like you're like, I asked for this, you know, and so I die.
14:10
I wish I could say like I have this great solution and here's my 4, step plan, how you can be happy CEO, and I just don't have any.
Like, I don't have that solution.
I can just tell you that it's hard in that if you feel like it's hard, you're not alone.
And that all in all that happens is that the hard changes and it becomes more complex.
14:30
One of the hard things that I have now, just in the current season is that like we are so big that I cannot I cannot I cannot take the team on my back and so we have a smaller business, you can go and do everything.
14:47
But once you are big enough, there is a an amount of work that huge like human capacity.
Like you cannot do it.
Right is impossible.
And so you have to watch things burn and have to fix it from afar by pulling levers by influencing people and doing it.
15:08
Way, that allows them to take ownership of those things and communicate, those things without being stressed without being short, without being what you don't want to be, you know what I mean to those people, and it's hard, it's super hard, you know?
15:23
And and, and hearing, you know, hearing just anything, you know, that - that happens, you know, in the, in the, in the group and having to Be like we're working on it, but I can't tell you that we're working on it because then people will then because of my customer service blows up, you know what I mean and working on something and having it perfect and then sending it to compliance, you know what I mean?
15:49
And having a torn apart and having to start again, you know what I mean and doing that process.
Again and again and it feels like Sisyphus who rolls up the the boulder on the hill only to get the top and have a roll down again that's what he was banished for for its great mythology but it's like you feel sometimes.
Like you're just rolling this ball up the hill to have it.
16:05
Roll back down again and There's nothing we can do about it, it's not circumstance, it's us, you know?
I mean, it's me like I have to be better.
And so, anyways, I'm only making this to partially document, I guess the season it that I'm in right now.
16:24
You know, we're, we're rolling out some really amazing things for like, you see, like some really, really amazing things in the next eight weeks that are going to really, really make a big difference and what it just takes a lot of work and it takes a lot of people, a lot of moving Parts, a lot of logistics.
16:43
A lot.
You don't mean, like everyone gets involved.
And right now I just posted on Instagram that like I have basically one month to do everything like for massive projects.
And so for me it's more time.
It's like I have to get all this stuff done and this has to happen.
17:01
And so if you guys want to join me on 30 days of just crushing life, at least crushing work, and then trying to manage life while you brush work, um, then you're welcome to join me.
But anyways, just say I love you guys.
I mess up all the time like I'm constantly inadequate for the needs of our customers for you guys and you know balancing the understanding in this is kind of for everyone that the nature of humanity is that we're never satisfied.
17:34
And so that comes from us the entrepreneur but also from your customers, you know, like I remember when like I just used the Amazon exam quiz, it's easy.
But like what Amazon's started doing, you know Prime shipping it was like, oh my God.
God to do shipping is amazing, right and then What happened after that was one day shipping happened?
17:54
And then when you get two day shipping, you're like what the hell Jeff like, where's my package?
And then same day shipping happened, right and two days feels like an eternity.
And so, you know, can you imagine you know, when they started this they're like two day shipping we're done, you know, like let's just let's just call it a day.
18:11
Like we crushed it.
Like we're amazing Brands, right and then within six months that just becomes the status quo and so like I think the reason that we have to Better is because human beings are never satisfied.
And so what used to be amazing is now status quo.
18:28
And so you have to deal with the negativity that comes with that that before he like you can't wish likewise.
Why is why am I getting this reaction now?
And I didn't get it six months ago and it's because people adapt people.
Now people use different things and so what used to be in select your best is no longer good enough because what is required is better than what you are.
18:48
And so I'm just trying to continue to remember that and And just continue.
Remember that it's?
It's about growth and that growth is painful and then we ask for this or at least I did.
So anyways guys, hope you guys have a sexy Saturday, a super productive, Saturday and and or maybe a super Russell, Saturday depends on where you're at but I'm going to be This is going to be team, no days off the next 30 days.
19:13
I have so many things that I need to get done in order to launch these four projects.
But I guarantee the gym Community will be much better off as real.
So so anyways, keep being awesome.
Thank you for tuning in.
Throw a like or comment.
If any of this makes sense to you and tell your friend if you want.
19:29
Hello.









0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
What's going over one?
Hope you guys are having us.
A fantastic Thursday.
I wanted to make a quick quick podcast.
I should do for you guys today and it is about my second biggest productivity hack.
So, I think the first one, the first biggest for me is waking up at at for, and getting, you know, 45 uninterrupted hours of work done without anyone bothering me.
0:50
And that is probably my single biggest act period because allows me to move my big balls.
Well, whoo, the Big Balls of the business forward.
But the second biggest hack is what I want to share with you today.
So one of the things that I think is most wasted as an entrepreneur, is what I would call the minutes in between the the rounded off minutes.
1:14
And so let's say you have an appointment that's scheduled to start at 2:30 and it's like 2008, right?
Or it's to 12 and a lot of times at least this was something I used to do that.
I actively try to break the Habit when I did it, honestly is when it's like, it's a game changer.
1:30
Is that I used to have the belief that I can't get anything real done in 18 minutes.
Right?
And what was interesting, is that a lot of times we put off doing things until we have big chunks of time, right?
1:47
But what I found is that there's this amount of aggravation or stress that open Loops cause, and so, like, one of the secrets and I got this from somebody who's talking about how to write a book, okay?
And so one of his secrets to writing a book and getting them done quickly was that he would never leave off his writing when he was when he had completed a thought.
2:10
And so it's like if you feel like you've completed a thought, you've completed the cycle, you're like cool, I wrap that up.
And what happens is it takes, then once once you're there, it feels like it.
Takes you a long time to like, go back in and start the next thought, right?
And so you feel like give the book a long time, all this kind of stuff, right?
2:26
And so instead he found that he would just have open loops and he Good finish, he would finish writing his writing session when he was halfway done working through a thought, okay?
And so it's like it's not complete yet.
And so what happened is he would just be like driven to get back to writing so he could complete this thought, but he wouldn't continue wouldn't stop until he had already started the next Loop because you're they had momentum, right?
2:49
And so I read this and I was like, oh my gosh because for me it was it's kind of just the the same thought, not just with writing a book but with like, how you're doing work and so I had this fear of like well I don't want to start something that I can't finish, but the reality is that, if you start something that you can't finish the likelihood that you're going to finish.
3:08
It faster is way way, way higher.
And so if I start something and let's say I start an email or I start a script like a sales script that I need to finish.
Our start a messenger sequence that I need to write or whatever, right.
And I, and I'm only like one third done and then I have to hop on a meeting for whatever, right?
3:29
I immediately.
Really want to go back to it as soon as the meetings over to continue, right?
And so what happens is I get to suck up all of those 18 minute eight-minute 12 minute chunks.
Throughout my day, rather than just pulling out my phone and going on Instagram, or going on Facebook to check my notifications because I got, you know, it's like 12 minutes and I can't tell you how much of a game changer has been for me obviously like you get all this - back in those minutes do at up, but I think more importantly, having the open loop in the mindset around the fact that if you Art something and you don't finish it.
4:02
It actually means it will get done faster, rather than more slowly.
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
4:18
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I push the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
4:37
And so that's probably my like second-biggest, like hack, or at least belief that I had to break for myself from like a, what I do everyday standpoint that has like super, super help me.
And so I hope that's, you know, hope that's useful for you guys because I know you guys are busy all the time.
You guys get tons of interruptions, probably like I do.
4:55
And just the shift of thinking I can start something and finish it and it's a good thing because then it's going to mean that I'm going to come back to it immediately and want to finish it faster.
So anyways, I hope you guys have an amazing Thursday.
I am Chris.
In today, y'all can join me in the proximity.
5:10
Hustle of getting tons and tons and tons of stuff done.
We're gone for, I think three weeks in may just doing, like, back-to-back, zillion things.
And we have all these releases that are coming out, like things that have been in the works for like six to nine months and they're all happening in a period of six weeks, it's going to be insane.
5:27
But the crunch time is now because I have to finish this stuff before we go.
So anyways guys, I hope you have an awesome day and you're super productive and that you suck up all those extra minutes that you might know.
Only have not used and just give it to Facebook to give ads to all right?
Have an amazing day.
5:43
Talk to you soon.
Bye.
Only have not used and just give it to Facebook to give ads to all right?
Have an amazing day.
Talk to you soon.
Bye.

Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
0:17
Hey, what's going on, everyone?
Hope you guys are having an awesome Friday.
Fantastic Friday.
I haven't made a few in a while and so I had all these topics and I've just been like traveling crazy so I apologize for that.
That.
But that being said, the one that I wanted to talk about was kind of a small Epiphany that I had that I was sharing with some of our directors which is that a lot of times we as entrepreneurs, try and change things that are working because something stops working.
0:43
And so we start thinking, oh like that doesn't work anymore.
When in reality, what happens is as like as a business grows it's simply the fundamentals become more complex to execute and to deliver.
0:59
And so, When you think about like scaling a business, right?
Like there's so many people who can maintain one-on-one clients really, really easily.
Write the idea though is that like human Connection in the things that you need to do to maintain a relationship and provide good value and provide service and whatnot.
Like don't change, right?
1:14
Like humans are different at scale as they are in, like, one-on-one, but we try and change our processes constantly.
And so, we spend all this time and effort, recreating Sops, creating new processes trying to like, change all this stuff when what, like, what I'm now seeing.
Like, even with our Company at scale the secret is that the people who are more advanced in business, don't do things that are fancy, they always do the fundamentals and it's just that the fundamentals when delivered at scale become complex.
1:44
And so I know this sounds like hopefully sound like semantics, but like, understanding that for me, has been a really big Epiphany or at least at articulating it that like, we don't need new, we need better, and better is doing the things that, you know, worked out of More skill at a large scale.
2:01
And so a lot of times it's not introducing things that are going to confuse your team that are going to like make them feel like you're constantly changing things, but instead kind of framing it is, how can we do the things that we're doing on a one-on-one level?
More of them, right?
When you have ten clients first 100 clients for 1000 clients things change, right?
2:19
But the actual experience should be the same for the end user and so that's kind of the process that you should think about.
In terms of like, how do I scale delivery?
Is what does it look like for a?
What if If I had a coach this person one-on-one, what does the client experience look like from their perspective?
And what is that?
2:35
What are those interactions?
What are those touch points?
What are the, what are the what are the communication cycles that happen there and then trying to extrapolate that out with the system's behind?
But it shouldn't change how that customers actually going through the experience.
And I think for some reason keeping that stable and making that not a variable has really helped me out mentally to think about how we how we design customer experiences and how we can scale delivery at a much larger at a much larger.
3:00
Level.
And so, I hope that helps you from from the gym standpoint, when you're looking at your customer customer experience when someone walks in the door when they're, you know, at the training session, all the things that you would normally do if you were coaching this person, 101, what would you do, right?
And then taking that and then seeing how we can do that this at scale with systems and multiple people.
3:19
But the actual customer experience is the same.
And so, if you articulate this to your team, I think it actually helps give Clarity because it feels more simple because it's not like we're introducing this system and this system and this system When really it's like we're just doing this thing because we're trying to still have this original one-on-one connection, which is originally why people came and why people loved us in the beginning.
3:39
And that's why people like so many gym owners can get from 0 to 70 0 to 100 FTS, really without any kind of training, right?
Because they know what that experience should look like.
They just don't know how to scale that experience and so if you look at if you look in words to yourself about, okay, I'm keeping the experience static that is Changing.
4:00
But as we have more people, the processes and the team that supports that will change.
But the objective Remains the Same.
And so like for me that was a little bit of an epiphany that I hope is useful for you and maybe even articulating to your team's about when you're like when you're making changes.
If you're a return listener and you have not rated or reviewed the show, I want you to know that you should feel absolutely terrible about yourself and everything else in the world getting but it would mean the absolute world to me.
4:28
If you guys would go ahead and do that, you don't have to pause the show, you keep listening and you can just do it with your thumb right now.
It'll take you less than 60 seconds.
And like I said, the only way that podcast arose through word of mouth and this is you joining hands with me and helping as many entrepreneurs with possibly can because no one is coming to save us, it's just us.
All right so please go do that now then let's Get back to the show.
4:49
It's like we're not actually changing anything.
We're changing a process to keep the experience consistent.
And I think, that, that decreases the anxiety levels of teams because in general, most teams are not entrepreneurs and so they like, fear change more than we do.
We love change and we're like, I, yes, let's change stuff.
5:06
Let's go break things and innovate but and your teams like, no, please don't change anything.
But if you think if you articulated in that way, it's really like we just need to play fundamentals.
Baseball fundamentals football.
Business at a large scale.
Look at Chick-fil-A.
5:22
For example, they create such an amazing business because they feel like an owner operated facility.
Like, if you go to a Chick-fil-A most times you'll see.
Like you're greeted with a smile.
Everything's clean.
They have fresh flowers on the table.
They thought, how can we take an individual owner experience and and and, and do it at scale and obviously that takes complexity, but it's, but the customer experience is the same, right?
5:47
The customer experience is that Of a like cheers where everyone knows your name and so they figured out the key points.
That if they were the owner, right?
They were the owner in the situation, like, you're the small shop owner.
How would you treat that customer?
If it was the only customer you had, or you saw them all the time and then reverse engineering that so that the experience remains static at scale.
6:09
And so, I hope you found this valuable.
This was just something that's been really big for me, that I've been spending a lot of time thinking over when I'm looking at not only not only just like customer service.
Also like sales like all times were think I like for us.
I'm like okay maybe we need to change the sales process.
Maybe maybe the avatars change, maybe the blah blah blah blah trite.
6:26
You start, you start wondering like, oh, do I need to change them to do?
I need to change something when in reality a lot of times things don't change nearly as fast as we perceive them to, as business owners.
It's just that the our ability to scale the experiences as changed, right?
And so, like like with our sales team, for example, we were like, oh maybe we need to change the script when in fact we have a manager right now who's going in and doing one on once and shadowing.
6:48
All the Calls and he and I had a call afterwards.
He's like, dude, we're just missing fundamentals.
Like we're not asking people, like clarifying their goal and like asking them that the, you know what, their pains are and their problems, like fundamentals football, right?
Like we're just not doing the fundamentals.
And so this was like this this this this story is coming from me.
7:04
Having just had something happen with that and just thinking like out loud.
Okay that's that's the issue.
It's just fundamentals at scale.
And so anyways guys, I hope you have an amazing amazing day and a fantastic Friday and maybe that's that unlock something for you like it.
For me.
7:19
All right, everybody's naked soon.
All right.
For me.
All right, everybody's naked soon.
All right.

It takes about four hours to get through, check it out.
On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
The audiobook is lows, they'll let me put it on for it, so I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
What's going on over?
What happened?
0:30
Thursday, I have a good one for you today, I'm calling this violence is the answer and what I learned from having four meetings with Arnold Schwarzenegger.
So, I haven't talked a lot about the stuff that we do the charity and I don't know why I haven't done it.
0:45
I think it was just because I never I didn't want it to feel like we were bragging about anything like that.
I think that's why I haven't discussed it as much, but that being said, I've got a ton of things that have been on my mind and a bunch of lessons that I think that I took from speaking with.
We had a breakfast together that was two hours long.
1:02
We went to his house less than a month ago shoes in two weeks ago and in all of the instances I feel like I mean there's tons of things you can learn from a man like that.
But the big thing that I was able to take away was I want to call it like The Optimist like a delusion of optimism.
1:23
And what I mean by that is that once like the higher, the level of success that you achieve the more Noise and hate.
You will receive, right?
And so if you think about like the amount of security, we had to go through, to get into Arnold's house and all of those things, it's like, just befitting of the fact that there are people out there who sent him death threats every day for just existing, right?
1:45
Because they watched a movie and their wife divorced someone for who looked like right.
And so that kind of leads to the second thing which is the more impact you have, the more Impressions you make based on the scale that you Of it's just law of large numbers.
2:01
Going to be a large percentage of batshit crazy people that you got to deal with right.
And so if for some reason the negativity of a trainer or a competitor or a client drags you down, then you don't have the mental fortitude for the success that you want to achieve.
2:19
Because the condition of that success is more not less of the hate of the shit of the noise that you're currently dealing with.
It doesn't go away, it gets louder and louder and louder and So one of the, one of the skills are the disciplines that we have to develop as entrepreneurs, especially if we seek this impact.
2:38
And that's the so many people that I talk to so many.
Isomers, like I want to impact, I want to help 10,000 people.
I want to transform lives.
If you want to help 10,000 people, then you have to be prepared to have 500 people who fucking hate you.
All right, because anyone who does anything worth doing is going to have an equal and opposite reaction, right?
2:58
That's how it is.
If you look at Every single great religious leader that's ever happened.
And it doesn't really matter almost all of them died, right?
And we're murdered for what they did and most people would argue that they were probably good people but with every positive thing that you do there's going to be equal reaction that's - right.
3:16
And so it's a it's like I just want to say the sentence to you because it means so much to me is that Hatred is a condition of success.
It's a condition.
If you have no hatred, if you have no people who hate you, who talk against you speak against you.
3:32
That it means you're standing for nothing.
Like you're standing for nothing.
Because if there is nothing for anyone to debate against you, then you stand for nothing and that means that you're not actually having any impact.
And so, you fear, that kind of Confrontation.
If you fear that kind of hate that kind of whatever, then you need to not be in business, or you need to fix that.
3:52
Part of yourself because you will sabotage your own success, you will become successful, the noise in the hatred and the naysayers will increase, and then you will make yourself less successful so that you don't have to deal with it, right?
That's that's like real, right?
That's what happens.
And, so, just just some of the mental things that I've that I've, you know, had to go through, you know, like you have trainers and you clients, you know, whatever it is, write the gyms.
4:18
One thing that I've seen with Arnold, and on the flip side Trump, right?
And they don't like each other, they're like Arnold outspoken against trumpet, like, I stuff.
But one thing that they both, share, that I really admire is almost a delusional optimism, is that they, um, they almost don't even, they don't even address it, they don't even acknowledge the presence of haters.
4:39
They just like, like, if you see, Trump get attacked he just won't even acknowledge it right.
Unless I've never voted.
I don't care, right?
But Point is like their level of mental, fortitude of being able to just exist on a plane.
4:55
That's above everyone else above all the noises the condition for them.
Being able to achieve the levels that they've been able to achieve, right?
And so one of the things about this, that gives me Solace is that none of the hatred.
5:10
None of the the trainer who leaves and starts talking shit about you.
None of the clients who leave and talk shit about you.
None of that ever affects your business.
It only affects you, right?
And so I think Layla made a post a week or two ago about like she was basically like, if anyone talk shit about you, it's because when they talk about themselves, no one gives a shit, right?
5:31
That's what they said.
That's what her quote said and she had like seven different people message her.
People who were talking shit about us, that we had no idea existed.
And so she was like, God, I'm never going to make that post to get, right?
But the thing is, is that this is the record, this is a record month for us is the best month in sales we've ever had.
5:47
Right, and amid that this was when she posted his post, and there's all this negativity.
And so, you have to remember that if there is negativity, there's also possibly this coming with it.
Because as ugly as this sounds, the really is no negative publicity.
6:02
Like, you know, this from the, from the freaking presidential election, right?
He won because there was he owned the conversation?
In bed, he owned it.
All right, and if everyone is talking about you guess, who they're not talking about anyone else, right?
And so you have to be polar, you have to stand for things because that is going to bring the haters out and you should welcome it.
6:22
You should be like, thank you for thinking about, appreciate that.
Thank you.
We had a record sales, quote this month, keep talking about me.
I love it like a feeding my bank account.
Keep going, dude, keep going.
It's awesome, right?
And so, Understanding that the law of large numbers is that the more people you impact right?
6:40
The more by percentage, you're going to rub the wrong way and so just like accept it and then always put things in context, all right?
And so when we have our in our quarterly meeting whenever, you know, some of them Frontline or some of them from management comes up with someone is like, I think this is a problem.
6:57
I was asked, all right what's the number of incidences?
And then how many total incidences do we?
And then how many total people who could potentially have an incident, Are there, right?
So I'll give an example.
We had someone who's manager who are saying, we had a gym owner of a complaint about PayPal that the getting paid out from PayPal on the prestige.
7:17
Lab sake said, I don't want to sign up because you guys pay for PayPal.
And I people She's like it really bothered me.
It was like well how many people is this better?
She's like so I think we should consider switching from PayPal was like well.
How many people is this?
7:32
Been an issue and she was like, well one like how many times in Philly Samia thousand?
So point one percent of people had a problem with it, like don't even let it touch you, you know what I mean?
Don't even let it touch your thought your mind because when you have scale you have 200 clients.
7:51
If you have five assholes, think about it.
It's two and a half percent of your entire clientele base.
What percentage of humans do you think are kind of crazy?
I would say at least two and a half.
Sent at least, right?
And so if you can, if you can always take apart the problems that arise or that people bring to you and think about it in context of the larger numbers that you dealing with.
8:13
I promise you, we'll make the noise of the world go down and you'll be able to get to that to send to that higher level and eventually we can get to the spiritual plane of Arnold and Trump, and whatever you feel about them.
I don't care.
It's just, you can appreciate the fact that they can exist on another plane and literally just live in a world of delusion.
8:31
Are like they're Untouchable because they put themselves in this box and there is a borderline where it does become delusional because you don't take feedback but because the hate is so loud, they almost can't allow it right?
Like Arnold was attacked at the Arnold Expo where he's like cheering kids on you don't even like people are crazy and you just got to accept that.
8:50
So let me make sure I hit all my lovely points.
Yeah, and so, the only thing that you have left to do that, actually drives.
Your business is the four numbers that I brought up the other day.
Is any of these things going to drive more applications?
9:08
Is it going to drive a higher percentage of clothes?
Is it going to decrease?
My turn?
Is it getting smart car?
Increase my probability in the believe it or not the haters, right?
That you have the trainer's ex-clients the whatever, right?
The likelihood that they're going to really impact like that.
9:24
They know the majority of the marketplace is basically zero, right?
Like if you have a client who leaves a my job, like I'm not talking about any specific language.
Like, I'm talking about the juice I'm saying like if you have a client your gym who leaves right and then they know 10 people, you know, 20 people they start making posts, right?
9:42
People only remember how they feel when they read that, no one ever remembers, what any shit talker talks about.
The only remember the negativity and they Eat it with the person who's talking shit which is why one of the biggest issues that I had early on in my life.
I'm just telling you is that I used to talk shit and it was like something that I really hated about myself.
10:00
And so the rule that I made is that if I am going to say something that is - I'm going to say to the person first and then if I am.
So if I do tell someone else I'm like hey by the way I've already told this person.
This this is what I think about and so that's kind of given me my like I don't say shit unless I've told the person about what I believe, right?
10:19
And so that's kind of my my rule of Of thumb for shit talking.
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
10:37
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
But I say all that to say that person who's left your business that client or whatever those 20 people, your ads are reaching 50 thousand people a day.
11:02
What actual impact do you think they have none?
And so you got to think about it in terms of math, right?
Because it will literally just like, put you at ease because you realize that the things that matter in the business are the things that matter.
This video is not going to drive sales for me, right?
11:18
I make these partially for me because I like documenting the journey and I want to Look back.
That's actually why I do this, right.
But me posting on, Instagram doesn't do shit right?
Doesn't do anything, right.
These don't really do much, the things that do are the things of doing.
The boring work of making sure that we refresh our ad content.
11:36
Make sure we have good offers.
Make sure that the leads are getting worked.
Make sure that we're following up.
Make sure that when we're on the sales calls were clarifying, whether there were labeling with a problem were going over there past paint, and there were selling them, the vacation and making sure that we can explain how we can fill the Gap, right?
The fundamentals.
11:52
And all skill is is doing the fundamentals in larger numbers.
That is all it is.
And there's complexity in that.
But the process from a mental standpoint is simple, right?
And so that is what's going to grow your business.
And so if you get distracted and you have somebody who's bugging your have a trainer, you have a client or whatever it is, just go back to your numbers and focus on the things that drive your business because I'm telling you that a any person is speaking against you, is, is confirming the fact that you weren't being successful.
12:21
It's a condition.
It's a condition of success if you stand for nothing, no one stands against you period.
So what it is, right?
So first the confirming that you're actually having an impact.
Second the bringing top of Mind awareness.
They're talking about you all the time.
Great.
And then third, it doesn't matter.
12:36
Anyways, all of it doesn't even matter because none of it is impacting, the things that grow your business.
And so just remember that when you're spending $100 a day, you're buying 2000 and freshens your mind, 2,000 people and you're buying every day, right?
Sir 25,000 Frenchmen.
12:54
So you might 5,000 eyeballs right in this person's organic reach is like 100.
It doesn't matter.
And so just like put it to rest, just stop worrying about.
Like, I can't tell you like, it had got to the point where people ask me they're like, hey do you want me to like send you this this stuff for other people?
13:12
It's like, nah, man.
I'm doing this two and a half years and when I came out, I was talking against things that people didn't like there was a lot of gurus who were established when I came into this three years ago.
I was like, I don't think I'll be okay.
I work.
Here's why this is math, right?
And they started bashing.
And that's like, that's cool.
But the math is wrong, right?
13:28
Like I'm gonna be right.
What they should have done, was copying my shit.
That's what they should have done.
And they did and they postulate against with pride, which is the wrong move.
And so I'm totally going another Direction but we're just going to rock with it.
So like from a strategy standpoint, right?
If you're the small player, what you want to do is you want to attack the methodology but the bigger player.
13:48
That's what you should write, but you better be right.
And you have to have a unique angle of why yours is better and different.
Right now, if you're the incumbent, there's virtually no reason that the incumbent, the person who's established in the market should ever lose.
14:05
The only reason they lose is because they're human and because they're human because the prideful and because they don't want to accept that they're wrong, or there could be another way, right?
Because technically the winner should do exactly what you see Amazon doing.
They let someone come up with something and then boom, it rip off and they copy, right?
14:21
And then that guy's gone.
Gone because they own the entire distribution Network.
And so real talk, there hasn't been anything that has come out from anyone that I have seen.
And, I know, because I buy everything, right, that has been useful right now and so I see everything and I will not let someone do to me what I did to the people before me which was attack attack attack the methodology because you don't want to be the type of person who attacks on this character.
14:50
It's just it's literally never looks good.
It's a losing battle, makes you look like an ass.
No one remembers who you're attacking.
They just remember to turn out, right?
So wrong strategy, that way.
You do want to attack the methodology if you have a superior option.
But the problem is, if you attack it loud enough and the the Eye of Sauron comes to you and sees what you're doing, what they should do.
15:10
The Strategic move is to take it distribute it and then wipe you up.
That is how that's the game.
Like, that's the game theory, they like, that's how you win.
And so the only way to beat the incumbent is also for the, that's why, that's why Amazon trades are like a zillion times its actual earnings, because no one knows how they can beat them.
15:29
How do you beat them?
They don't have an ego about it.
They don't give a shit.
They're like cool.
You found a new toilet paper brand.
Boom, got it and they and Jeff distributes it.
And that was his toilet paper bread, right?
He doesn't care.
He doesn't he go about it, he's like, great.
Thanks for doing the Hardy, I appreciate that.
And so it's only the people who have the ego about being like I was the first one, like no one cares, right?
15:51
Only thing, people care about it so much.
America period.
And that you are looking always for the next thing.
And so that's why that's what we came out of hybrid, right?
Like, that's the next thing.
Like, I think down the road group.
I mean group changes not going away, but the price points will become increasingly commoditized, on the pressure will increase in the middle tier prayers.
16:12
The lower tier players are going to go out, right?
Just what it is and so if I'm helping the most amount of people I have to create the new or the next opportunity to shift every one into which is going to take the next Seven years of gold rush until eventually more and more people, copy it.
And then we'll come up with the next thing because that's business, right?
16:28
If you want something that's gonna stick around forever, don't be a business owner.
It's not going to work, right?
Same thing with marketing.
So anyways, all this to say, the reason I call this violence is the answer is that Massive Action is.
The only thing you can do, right?
It's the only, it's the only combat you have.
16:43
It's like success is the only revenge is that you just keep focusing on doing you and increasing the amount of opportunities, increasing the percentage that you capture.
And Seeing the turn your business.
That is all you do.
That's all you focus on.
And the rest of it does not matter.
Ignore it, it doesn't matter.
17:00
The only way that it starts to actually affect those numbers, if it takes up your head space, see, only way someone wins, it's the only way.
And so if you don't want someone to win, right?
And someone talks shit, it's a client, it's a trainer, it's a whatever competitor, right?
17:16
First off understand that they're not marketing to the people that you're marketing to their not.
Right.
And their little itty-bitty reach is Elevated compared to how much we're spending.
And that's what we pay Facebook, because they give us distribution, right?
Just get that.
And then understand that none of that is.
Anyway, going to affect your business unless you allow it to affect you.
17:33
That's all.
So, that is why violence is the answer.
That is probably the single greatest lesson that I that I learned and witnessed from Arnold and being close proximity with them.
Obviously, talks about work.
Now, we talk about business stuff, we talked about charity, talk to lots of things, but principal the essence that I feel like I got from him, was that he exists on his own playing field?
17:55
He plays his own game and he just lets everyone else react.
And that was probably the single biggest takeaway that I saw is that like, when you get to that level, You have to have this, this level of mental fortitude that is almost delusional it borders on delusion.
But the only difference between crazy people in Geniuses is that the Geniuses were, right?
18:14
It's the only difference, right?
And so like if you're like, we're going to make it, we're going to make it we're making and you do all of a sudden everything you did before was saying, right?
And so if you have to distant place real, like don't show me that stuff.
If you have, you know, your managers your trainers are like hey this gym down the street like talk shit about us, right?
18:30
If they say that to you like don't show me that shit.
The only way that it Will actually affect our business is if we talk about it because it doesn't actually affect our business in any way.
You close the sales tonight.
Yeah, I'm are, we marketing making more ads?
Yes.
Right.
Are you doing your the 5/4 more attention?
18:45
Yes.
Great then.
Let's just keep fucking wrong, right?
That's all that matters.
You keep scheme rolling forward and the thing that pisses everyone else off is being unfuckable, right?
You can't be fucked with you.
Just keep going and keep going and then the noise gets louder because they want a reaction, and you just keep fucking going, right?
19:02
And you keep winning.
Because what you do is you focus as soon as they get loud in focus in, you focus in on the things that drive your business, which is the math, right?
It's doing the work, there's nothing else, right?
Don't get in some pissing.
That's doesn't matter, right?
Just distraction takes your attention.
19:18
So anyways, I hope that there's somebody here who that affects.
I hope there's somebody here, who's dealing with a trainer or doing with a client, or do you want the competitor?
Who's talking shit, who's making posts?
Who's who's who?
It's like.
Whenever you see that?
Just feel like Thanks for thinking about me, bro.
19:34
I appreciate that.
You know, thanks for talking about, keep.
Thanks for keeping me top of mind like much love, but you got to think like that because that's the only way and I'll get even more under there.
And now you're in their minds and they're not in yours because you just keep doing what you need to do.
And that's the only way you win.
So anyways, lots of everybody will be able to mazing Thursday and keeping awesome.
19:54
I love you all tomorrow.
Is he sick?
All right.









0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
Good morning, everyone.
Hope you guys are having a fantastic Friday and into the week for normal people, but the beginning of the great working weekend that it is to be an entrepreneur.
And so in the last 24 hours, I had a lot of people reach out.
0:42
Obviously, it's the book stuff that we launched.
And I had a few questions that came up kind of repeatedly and I figured and I gave some long paragraph answers and I was like, you know what might be worth making a podcast such video about it.
And so three questions that came up, these were kind of the themes of them.
0:58
One was, you know, what keeps you Motivated, why like why do you keep pushing if you already have, you know what you need?
You know, from a financial standpoint.
The next one is like as you're as you're growing the business and everything gets bigger in the world gets louder.
How do you keep from being overwhelmed, right?
1:14
And then, you know, the follow-up to that was like, how do you stay focused on your goals?
And so I wanted to break down.
So I think each of those is somewhat different and I wanted to break down some of the things that, you know, I've gone through or that that have evolved in my thinking and approaching those things that have really helped me.
And so, the first one, what keeps you motivated?
1:32
I want to keep this really real with you.
I'm I have the, the picture the paint that I paint like the vision of what I like, where we want Jim wants to go what we want to do in the world.
And for those of you who don't know, the very big 10,000-foot view, picture of what I'm trying to do, and what we're trying to do at Jim launch is actually significantly bigger than Jim's.
1:52
And so I got into the Fitness business because I, you know, I'm finishing my life and so it was on Honestly it was the only thing that I really knew how to do and so that's what I sold because people started paying me for it.
So I wasn't like as like this was my grand plan on the time it was like well people are already starting to ask me for advice and it's getting the poem.
2:12
People want to know, I don't have enough time like I needed to start charging stuff.
Right.
But that was like, so I Am Hash about Fitness, but what we're trying to do, big picture is as Uber transform, the transportation industry, it wasn't like the amount of Education from the government.
That was like, we need to carpool more like people should.
2:30
I'd share, you know what I mean?
Like that was going on for years.
There were carpool lanes, but people still didn't do anything with it.
The moment that transportation change was the moment that Uber created a Marketplace for it, the created an opportunity for people to be able to make an income by moving things.
2:45
And moving people.
Once that happened the transportation industry was transformed because a Marketplace was it was created right?
And so for me the goal is how can we create an opportunity?
That's significant enough that someone can make a real income as a low barrier to entry so that people can get coaching and the coach is can make money doing it.
3:06
And so that's that's the big, big picture is like, how can I help Fitness professionals?
How can I help people coach people on weight loss?
Because I mean sure everybody has their Dogma about nutrition and training bubble butt.
Like big big picture.
Most people know what they actually need to do.
They need to stop eating shit and they need to move, right?
3:23
Like most people know that, and they just need someone to hold them accountable.
And so I'm trying to find a way to get people to create a Marketplace such that People can hold people accountable and make an income from it.
That is my 10,000-foot vision for what we're trying to do.
But if I'm being real, that is not what motivates me day-to-day, because that's really big Pie in the Sky stuff.
3:41
But like when you've got legal teams and compliance and HR, and, you know, an ex-employee saying that you're a racist and even I mean, like, all sorts of shit.
You know what I mean?
That like, that can happen on a day like none of those things where you are going on but I'm just they have, you know what I mean?
And so like, There's there's a million small stressors that can that can come on.
4:01
So how do you, how do you, how do you way through the shit, right?
How do you, how do you push through that?
And the first thing for me has been, and I mentioned this in the beginning, the book is like, I am more motivated by fear and away from pain that I am towards game.
4:17
So I personally am more fear and I'm more fear driven than I am gain driven.
So like a friend of mine called me up the other day and was like so it's like he started the conversation by saying like, well it's clear that money is not the motivator for you anymore, right?
4:33
Because like he's like, you're already done.
Like you don't need any more money and it was like, since he said it.
So like, point you, like, matter of fact, I was like, it took me back for a second and I was like, I guess you're kind of right.
Like, I don't really yeah, I don't I'm not really doing it for the money but it's really the fear of failure.
4:50
You know what I mean?
The fear of and the thing is, is like the higher you go.
The more you feel fear the fall and so anything like everyone around me is like Like you're more driven now than you were when you started and some ways.
It's true because we're higher up the mountain in the fall would be horse and some like even more afraid of it.
And so we drive harder.
5:07
And so, like, what keeps me motivated, honestly is fear is fear of losing everything.
Now, obviously we've taken, you know, steps to try and not, you know, try and protect ourselves.
And, you know, put things in places that are, you know, very, you know, protecting all that kind of stuff.
But, but still like and I am a human being, you know, I have irrational.
5:24
Fears and so, one of the things that drives me is that and I know that when they when they interviewed like, Like gold medalists invariably.
One of the things that they notice is that the people who won or not motivated by winning their are motivated because they hated losing and so you can be motivated, whatever way you want.
5:40
I can tell you that for me it probably comes from a place of fear and a little bit of anger and I'm just being real with you like that's that's what actually drives me but I try and point that in a direction that accomplishes something like really beautiful and awesome but like that is what drives me on a day to day to keep going.
5:58
How do I start from being overwhelmed?
Which is the second like kind of theme of questions that I get with all the things that come up?
The biggest thing that I do is I think what have these things are under my control.
And what are these?
Things are not right.
And so the things that are not under my control, I immediately cut out of my like, thought processes and thinking cool already already already figured those out, they're not on my bike, I can't control those, right?
6:20
And then of the variables that I can control, okay, which of these is the most important and then I start action plans.
And the thing is, as long as I am in as Long as we have decided what the problems are and we are in process.
My anxiety levels go down the time.
When my anxiety spikes, I think you guys maybe notice this like two or three weeks ago, I was really stressed and it was because we had this bottleneck in the business and it and I won't get into the details.
6:47
But there was there was a series of processes and people that were put together wrong and it was just creating an enormous.
I'm gonna stress for me and I had to wait a certain period of time before I was able to take action on it and so it was like watching a fire Burnin Up.
Being able to do anything about it and that is where I get the most anxiety and overwhelming overwhelming from if we are taking steps to correct something.
7:06
I'm usually pretty cool about it.
Once it's like, yep, I know there's a problem, but we are, we are fixing it, you know, I mean, like we are, you know, we're four weeks out from it being, you know, resolved, or at least the our best bet of resolving is going through.
So for you, if you feel overwhelmed a lot of times it's in my opinion, you have things that are open Loops, you have loops that you haven't completed and so it's like you have problems.
7:28
You have fires that are burning and you don't know how you're going to put them out.
And so I think it's like once you create the plan and you start walking the plan, then usually my anxiety levels go down and if you're like, well, what about this thing?
Can I control it?
If you can't control it, then like don't want to take up your mind, you know, your mind space and that does take disappointing.
7:44
I mean I'm not saying I'm perfect.
I'm just I think you just you gain some experience.
I have so much brain brain with and so I might as well put it on stuff, I can control.
So that's that's like how do you how do you stop from being overwhelmed?
And then, The third one.
Like how do you stay focused on your goals?
8:01
I think actually kind of that kind of routes back to the first thing that I was saying, which is like I really, really I wish I had something really sexy and like really, like I just I just love everyone, and I just want to transform lives and I want everyone to lose weight.
8:17
Like, I wish that were actually the thing that motivated me.
And that is something that I want to accomplish, and I think that if I were like on a stage, receiving, an award or something, I would probably say that this is, you know, we're really happy to accomplish this, but I probably something say something, like, what I'm saying now, which is, hey, guys, love that you're listening to the podcast.
8:38
Cast if you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, It didn't come from a b hasn't come from a place of Serenity, you know what I mean?
9:00
It hasn't like a lot of a lot of the things that have happened have not been.
Like I just want to save everyone in order mean like a lot of it is just really being afraid to fail and being afraid of what people would say.
And being afraid of, you know, and I'm working on that.
You don't even I'm not like I'm not immune to it.
9:17
Like I actively realize that that's probably not a good thing but I'm just being real with you like it.
It's something it's something that's driven me since day one.
Like I you know, and I know there's an entrepreneurial story and some of you may resonate with this but like I was a really good student.
9:36
Like I work really hard and I got good grades, you know, I mean, I finished College in three years.
Like, I scored really well on the SATs and G mats and all that stuff.
Like I was a good student because I was afraid not to be.
And so I know there's the whole like entrepreneurial add and I'm a TD is shit.
But like I think that you can overcome anything if you are just, you know, if you have enough motivation and I joke with Layla, I was like I think that I call the Great accomplishments in the world are done by people who have a big hole inside of them that they're trying to fill.
10:06
And I don't, you know, I'm just being real with you.
I think that there's there's a lot of Truth to that as that there's there's like deep-seated insecurities and a lot of people who have done a great thing because they're trying to fill a hole and so anyways I just wanted to let you know those.
Let you guys know last 24 hours was awesome, mix of emotions.
10:24
Obviously we launched the book and you know tons of copies sold which is awesome.
Really excited to hear the feedback and and and get tagged and stuff.
So if you guys, if you guys do open it, you know, video cell phone.
Yet and tag me in it.
I'd love to see it.
And let me know what you guys think.
10:39
Spent a lot of time on the book but there's obviously the roller coaster which is like our the entire Landing Page Self, God, disapproved the moment at what life was just like, you know, it's so but it's just like, it's just part of the game, you know, and we launched a campaign that has.
Now, this is now the eighth campaign and each campaign that we launched, has probably 50 yards in it and we've done eight campaigns in a row that it fails.
11:04
And so like, you know, like what Like what keeps you going?
Is just like, I don't know, I don't think we have any other choice and I think that's, that's When I was, when I was at the gym in the very beginning, it was I think it was, it was top as top three hardest things.
11:21
I've done, was opening the gym just like the first nine months was horrible for me.
And I kept thinking to myself, and I hope this is politically correct, but I used to think to myself like, An entire race of people went through slavery for hundreds of years, write something that's absolutely horrible.
11:41
And something that like we can barely comprehend, right?
And I would think to myself like how could they do it, you know what I mean?
And there's so many people, so it wasn't like, there's like, it wasn't like they're people who had really high will and really low will.
It's like everyone did it, right?
11:58
And so when I see something, we're like everyone does something there's other forces at work.
And so, the way I perceive that Is it's amazing what you can do when you have no choice.
And so I think in some ways like us as entrepreneurs or at least for me, like, I pretend there is no door, there is no exit door for us.
12:19
And that's what, that's, what keeps us in.
It is like, I have no choice.
Like, I have to keep going and so like, I don't really entertain the thoughts very much because all the, every single entrepreneur that I look up to, and the more I get close with people who are Finley higher up than we are.
12:37
They tell the same stories they're like this sucked.
This was really hard.
There was two years where I barely slept, you know what I mean?
And they're like and it was just stress, like it was Heavy.
I can't even breathe.
And these are people that have like totally achieved massive amounts, hundreds of millions, billions of dollars.
And and I hear these and they're normal people, you know, I mean they're not different than you.
12:56
And me and just the way that they tell the story is like it's literally just perseverance like it's just grit.
It's just like how long can you keep going?
And and I think that that's like, it's just like, how bad do you want something and that's it and like, when you, when they look at achievement like like that's the single deciding factor is not intelligence.
13:18
It's not like it's not any of these other things that's just like, how long will you stick with it?
And I told you guys that the book grit that I was reading effort.
Counts twice to me achievement like category.
It's like first you have talent times effort to get a skill and then it Skill X effort to achieve something and so effort, counts twice and so like I think like potential mean shit like, who cares, what your potential is like members of just not living up to my potential?
13:46
No one is, you know what I mean?
And a different way of thinking about this.
And this is one that's kind of like trip you to like wrap your head around is that you may see people who you believe are more talented than you and they might be but if you think about any human, right, and their potential for how much Which they can achieve with an inordinate amount of effort, right?
14:12
It is more than what the talented person can achieve with a medium amount of effort, right?
And so, like, the thing is, like, the effort equation.
I'm moving back is like, there's so much there's so much gap between where you are and what potential is and the and the one thing that drives you, it's just so much bigger than people think, you know what I mean?
14:33
And the one driver is effort, right?
And so, like, in some way it's incredibly comforting to me because like a skilled, A talented painter.
Somebody who picks up the squeal skill quickly.
Still will now out paint somebody who stays with it for 25 years.
14:51
Not even close, not even by a mile, right?
Because effort still means more than everything, right?
Everyone's like, well, I want to try and find something that like you're you're talented for but the reality is that talent doesn't even really matter because it's longevity and so it's really about like I mean in the beginning, you think like I want to do something, I'm passionate about.
15:10
But the reality is like, I think passion Fades, you know I mean passions just like the spark to get you going but after that it's like what drives you what drives you when you're 3 years in which I view, when you're five years in like, I mean for me it's just like, it's like an identity thing.
15:28
It's like, what kind of person am I?
It does that make sense?
Like who do I choose to be?
What kind of person do I want my kids to think I am.
When, like, when she got hard, did Dad stop, you know what I mean to Dad, blame the market, the dad-blame X2, dad-blame why, like I think about these stories that I think my kids are going to tell about where we're what we're doing right now.
15:54
Now, and I think what store do I want them to tell?
And then more importantly, what story would do?
I want to tell myself every day?
And so it's like, I'm almost selling myself on who I am as I'm doing it.
If that makes any sense to anyone like you're like, actively, creating your identity in the story, you're telling while you're walking it and so it's like you become the hero of your own story but you're not that hero yet, but you're becoming them as you walk.
16:21
So anyways, that was just like I got a Those questions.
And I hope that's my that's my best shot at.
I mean, maybe maybe I'll have another shot six months from now that will be different, but that's, that's kind of the best shot.
That I've got four.
Like, what keeps me motivated?
Like, how do I stop from being overwhelmed?
How do I stay focused on the goals?
16:37
Like you just just keep going and it's like, what kind of person I want to be?
So anyways, lots of everybody, hope you have an amazing amazing day and you crush your goals.
And I am recording the audio book called a, lots of fun and probably those of you who, as soon as it It gets released like I can't.
16:55
Do you like chapter 25 and be like Rollo.
This is Alex sound like Batman.
Anyways, guys, have an amazing day and I will catch you guys soon.
It gets released like I can't.
Do you like chapter 25 and be like Rollo.
This is Alex sound like Batman.
Anyways, guys, have an amazing day and I will catch you guys soon.









0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
Happy Thursday, everybody.
Hope you guys have an amazing day and start or end too.
Your work week and if you're not familiar, it's just a little of anything because you're working all the time.
Hey, the strongest profit lever in business, and how to use it.
0:39
So, a lot of times, I mean, I like, I like talking about this stuff is probably my favorite Topic in the world and I feel like I've made a few more months of videos lately.
So, I want to make one about the money's.
So I've been in a deep deep deep, dive reading books and I have I've come into business.
0:56
Love with a man named Patrick Campbell.
He, he owns two companies one called price until Everyone called profit.
Well, they are SAS companies and price.
Intelligently is a company that just reviews and just works on tons and tons of data around SAS companies.
And the reason that I think it's really interesting is that there's so many principles that he's been able to back with data looking at ten eleven thousand different companies in terms of payment structures and just tons of different data that he used that.
1:20
I thought I would share some of the findings that I've had with you.
So when they did an analysis of all the blog post written specifically towards SAS businesses, which is Software as a service.
You know what's that means?
And for many of us we are in the service business.
So a lot of the findings, the majority of them, apply directly to what we do.
1:39
And so anywho many of you are, maybe some of you have heard of the genie in the bottle story.
But basically, you know, if you rub a lamp and you ask a genie, you know, double my business and he says, okay, there's three ways you can do it one, we can double the amount of customers to we can double the, you know, decrease your turn by half or three.
1:58
We can double your prices.
And the, you know, the question is, which one would you choose?
And he was able to back with data exactly what we find with that original scenario.
So for those who don't know, when you double your customers, you pretty much double everything that's already there.
2:16
And usually profit will go down a little bit because there's additional cost as you scale, right?
And so if you were doing let's say ten thousand dollars a month and you have two thousand dollars a month in profit.
If you doubled to 20,000 a month with twice as many customers, you would technically have four thousand dollars a month in profit.
It.
But as some of you may know sometimes costs can increase as business goes up.
2:34
So you would be at four thousand dollars ish in profit, right?
So you doubled across the board.
If you double the are decrease, the churned by half, so you doubled your lifetime value in duration, what would happen is, you'd be able to spend twice as much an acquisition because each person is worth twice as much.
2:51
But so overall, you would end up with the same number in terms of how much profit you make, but you'd have an additional benefit.
Fact, we would have to spend as much on marketing or you could use that to lever and double down and grow that way because you can spend twice as much on Market.
All right, the third door, which is double your prices, right?
3:10
If you took the original example of ten thousand dollars a month with a 20% margin and then you doubled it to twenty thousand dollars a month.
You get the same cost of fulfillment, which was the 8000, right?
The 80% from the original number.
Then you can go from two thousand dollars a month, the prophet to 12,000 ultimately profit.
All right, so that's a 6X increase in profitability by doubling one number.
3:28
All right.
And so he felt Found when he was looking at all the data from 11,000 SAS companies.
And so, his company does basically works on the processing side to help collect Revenue.
That's lost for SAS companies.
And so he has a direct tie and how much revenue they're making.
3:44
So he has all this amazing data to pull from.
And so, if you increase, if you do a one percent increase on any of these three metrics, either one percent decrease in cost of acquisition, 1% increase in price or One percent decrease in churn, the response was, let's say, 1 X4 acquisition in terms of how much it would increase the profitability 2x for decreasing to turn and Forex for increasing the price by 1%.
4:15
And so it just showed how much more powerful pricing is to profit within your business.
And so, the reason that I think this is fascinating and why this can be relevant to you is that if you're looking at your Your business, right?
We know that for Jim's The Profit points for larger Training Center, typically in order for it to be profitable, a hundred sixty seven dollars a month which is thirty seven.
4:39
Thirty nine dollars a week, tends to be the point where you actually can make a real amount of profit in the business.
Right?
And so we know at Jim launch that we add additional services or different value in order to retain customers, right?
So we add a lot of the accountability features in Haven cards, you know, checking in every other week.
4:56
I like my stuff, right?
And so at a very basic Level if you don't even think about you know, online businesses or anything that's suffering, the hybrid stuff that I've talked about.
If you were to Simply bolt on the one-on-one coaching component and charge $200 a month, which is what we are, which is the number that we're seeing go all day long for existing customers to add in one on one coaching with food and helping them.
5:20
Stay accountable with daily, check-ins and bi-weekly, which is twice a month in person, check-ins where you can also sell supplements then that is akin to do.
Pulling your price right in that example that I gave earlier.
So you go from having a customer at $200 a month to go into four hundred dollars a month, right?
5:38
And so that means that from doing that same thing you can potentially 6X the profits in your business, right?
And so this is why I get so excited about the hybrid thing.
So even even if you're like, I don't want to change my gym.
I left my gym.
That's awesome.
Great fantastic.
But if you want to make more profit that ultimately going to have to figure out how to provide more value, right?
5:57
And the biggest lever to increasing in profit Business is the price.
And so, what can we do?
That scales price-wise, right?
That doesn't incur lots of costume services.
Hey guys real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
6:13
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
6:30
Its fo free in exchange for email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller All Leads and so that you can not miss Out on it because last time I sold out for like eight straight weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
And that's where both one comes in.
6:47
And so you could not even not even change anything about your acquisition, not change anything about how you sell or how you Market or any of that stuff.
But only use it as an upsell or an Ascension peace within your business and be able to upsell X percentage of customers.
So, let's say you're able to upsell 35% year or let's say 33 from it's okay.
7:05
So third of your customers were able to take that up.
So which is a seventy dollar increase in average ticket per customer, right?
And so, we know right now and this is just because we've got Interesting data that we just pulled from the coaching side.
The average gym right now makes about $35 per month in profit per customer right?
7:24
And that doesn't include supplement sales anything like that.
But simply in just from their service site, right?
And so, if you were to add $70 per right per customer then and your cost of fulfillment is $50 per customer that is using it, which means we have to divide it by three since it was 33%.
7:44
Scent which would be baseless a $16, right?
So you take your 70 and you take out your 16, all right?
Then you're at fifty four dollars extra per client that you would now make across the board by implementing bolt on on top of your existing business, okay?
8:01
And so that would mean that your profit went from $35 per customers to 54 per customer.
All right, so with two and a half X, the amount of money that you make every month by simply implementing.
One thing that adds value to your existing customer base That doesn't fundamentally change our model at all.
8:17
And so if you want to two and a half X, the prophet of the gym that you are working that you have right now.
Simple many simply bolting on this additional Revenue stream without changing anything else in the business will tune affects how much you take home.
Is that a worthwhile Endeavor especially considering it only takes about 1 month to implement the entire thing and then you're done with it and then from that point going forward it just becomes a consistent upsell that you have for for people who are coming in the door.
8:42
All right, so look at your math.
'The and pull the numbers for yourself.
These are the averages that we had.
So if you're like, okay, and the way that you pull those numbers in terms of what your average profit per customers per month, if you look at how much room you brought in how many customers you have, right, and then how much you took home.
8:57
So let's say you took home six thousand dollars last month, right?
And you have 155 customers.
So, if you took home, six thousand dollars from 155 customers / 6,000, 155 means you'd be making $39 per customer in profit per month, right?
9:14
And so, When you see those numbers and you know, that you can get 1/3 of your clients to upsell and take something at $200, a month extra in service that cost you $50 or less to fulfill, right?
Not including the extra Revenue, you can sell with nutrition based supplements and things like that.
But purely from the service side because you made have limiting beliefs around selling control products which is fine whatever.
9:34
But just doing this one thing which is going to enhance the value that the customers get decrease your turn as well which is an ancillary benefit an additional benefit because we have a one-on-one coach at one point of contact.
Act, then your turn decreases because you have a consistent relationship, right?
And so they don't get lost in the masses of group training, which is typically what happens.
9:51
And we have to we have to recreate a one-on-one experience by having scalable delivery, with the accountability and retention pieces that we have to build in normally to a training business.
But when you add in this one component, this one additional upsell the amount of money that you can make your business, literally, two and half axes.
And so, rather than opening two and a half more gems, right?
10:08
Expose yourself to two and half times the liability.
You can do this one thing.
Make two and a half times the money.
So that is my.
That is my big case here.
So the strong profit in your business is price and the way to get the price is to add more value.
And so right now Ascension is another great stuff that he had is that upsells cops 1/4, the amount in total cost as a position.
10:32
And so that means the revenues four times as valuable from a business standpoint.
And so this is essentially what this is is it gives you an upsell that you don't have to have more square footage to fulfill.
And it drives down your turn.
So increases lifetime value of your of your service side of your training site.
10:49
So you literally increase the lifetime value of service side by simply implementing this on top of this.
So it has two benefits because they think two of the growth levers by doing one thing which is adding this additional service on top, that which is the one I want accountability that you can do and fulfill remotely, okay?
So as a tangential benefit, it also allows you to pay some of your trainers.
11:07
If you have like one or two hork like strong stallions, awesome trainers allows you to pay them.
I'm more, right?
Because now you can give them that little piece of these people who took the upsell.
And so now you can have that guy who you're like, man, I wish I could paint for Grandma but I only paid 2,500 this allows you to do that.
11:23
So let's take the example of 155 client gym that I just made up, right?
So you can hundred fifty five clients and you up sold one.
Third right?
I'm 23.
Then you have 51 clients who now are on $200 a month, right?
It actually be to 12 if you do the math so it's ten thousand eight hundred and forty three dollars of additional Revenue right.
11:45
But then let's do the how much the cost is.
So 51 clients times the $50, right?
So you're 25 25 15 cost and then you take out your 10,800, right?
It's, you make an extra 80 200 dollars a month, which is an extra hundred grand a year.
12:01
That's it.
So you add an extra hundred grand a year to the business in profit, right by adding this a single upsell to your core core Mom.
That's it, you don't need more square footage, you don't need more training times, you don't even wear trainers.
All of this can be done by simply omitting one thing, all right?
12:17
And that's the deal, that's how it works.
So anywho that this is just something that I get excited about is a geek out on pricing and data.
Like when someone really just backs, everything the data, especially when it supports some of the anecdotal things that we have seen just from trial and error between all the facilities that we that we work with, right?
I get excited about, I want to share with you.
12:33
So, if you, if you, if you, if you haven't gotten on board that they don't believe the numbers speak louder than any story, ever can write.
But I know humans.
And that's not actually how it works, which is why we only get testimonials because people are emotional, they don't make rational decisions about their business, but if you do choose to make rational decisions, which is usually how you make more money, then you should definitely in from this, in your business.
12:55
Obviously, if you help Comment tag, somebody whatever.
I'm sure there's a million ways, you can apply and get on the phone with them are guys.
But that was not a pitch.
It was literally just to talk to you about.
How pricing is so powerful and how you have to add value in order to remain competitive, in an increasingly saturated Market, which is going to drive down the price of training, right, Group Training, it's always going to drive down that way.
13:14
So, in order to escape that we have more value and we had differentiated services on top of it so that we can recover something that might be lost on the price for original, all right?
So both the make sense, hope you enjoyed that and tag someone like One or whatever, whatever.
Whatever you do.
You know, Sharon Target, all that good stuff.
13:30
All right, how to make some day, guys, and I will talk to you guys on the flip side.0:00
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out, if that's what you are into.
0:16
And if not keep enjoying the show, hey, guys, I want to talk to you about the five core functions of business and this was something that I've like II inherently thought, like, this is the process that I think about business with, but when out traffic, To put it on a chart.
I was like, oh wait great.
0:31
It's just it just put a better name to it.
We hit all these pieces but I didn't delineate it the way he did and I thought it was really, really awesome.
So I want to share it with you and if you can think about your business and these five terms, then it'll make it abundantly clear to you where you are, missing the boat and where there's a lot of Revenue left on the table.
0:47
Okay?
Now first place is Legion.
Okay, that's where this whole, this whole game starts.
Okay, how do we get people into our pipeline?
How do we get people into our world, okay?
And a business works like a pipeline anyone tells you otherwise it just Whatever.
I don't know.
I don't know what they're telling you, but it's a pipeline, okay, people going to go from A to Z and they're going to follow these steps in sequence, okay?
1:08
So first you have to generate leads, which is where you're getting traffic, what are your offer is going to be blah, blah, blah?
That's all Legion.
Once you have an inquiry, that's name, phone number email, or an application, whatever, you know, depends on the promotion, which one you use, then?
What's the process that you take from a lead to get them in the door, which is part to the third which you could call lead nurturing.
1:30
Sure, whatever you want to call that.
I don't like nurture because that seems like very back into me.
I like, like, how do you work?
The lead as Phase. 2, 3 is, what is the actual conversation look?
Like when you're getting once you've made contact with this person, what is the actual sale look like, what's the script?
1:45
What are maybe series of scripts you take them through depending on the price point of the item and then what choreographed experience we want them to have in order to get them to say yes.
Okay, that's the third piece.
The fourth piece is everyone's least favorite.
I'm just kidding.
It's um it's a how are you get an amazing experience that's consistent and it over delivers above and beyond what they believe the value that they pay for right and just totally blows them out of the water.
2:10
How do we do the Fulfillment piece?
That's amazing.
Okay, that's four.
And then five, which a lot of people totally miss out on which is Ascension and resell, which I would also put a third Silo in there.
Which is how do we give referrals which kind of Loops back to the beginning which is Legion.
The second piece is how do we get these people to buy more expensive stuff from us?
2:30
And then the third is how do we get them to buy again, right?
So within the context of a gym business, this would be up selling personal training.
This would be getting them to sign longer memberships or just retention in.
General is getting them to buy more times.
If you think about others buying another month, find another home find another month.
So its frequency transaction, right?
2:46
So, buying lots of things, all right.
Another piece would be having them upgrade into specific programs that are have a, you know, a clear duration.
So let's say a their normal boot camp members and they upgrade to special, you know, abs and guns 12, Week challenge for another, you know, $800 on top of their 150 $200, a month membership, right?
3:07
So that's, that's what we're talking about here.
And those, those are the five core functions of the business.
So if you look at your business, Think about which ones are lacking and a lot of times everyone thinks Legion but usually like the other ones are the cheapest like Legion is like the most expensive part of the business proposition in the rest of them.
3:24
All, still feed your bottom line and top line, but most people don't think about exert such as we jump, which I understand, but if you never lose customers and you continually upsell people, it's a more boring but Services, you can still make tons and tons of money but you need all five to have a thriving growing business.
3:40
So hopefully that was used for you to think about and I look forward to hearing your thoughts.
You have on best practices for any of those things and I will delve into each one of those in a lot more detail in upcoming podcast.









0:00
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into.
0:16
And if not keep enjoying the show, happy Thursday, everyone who you are having an amazing second half of your week.
Post hump day.
I want to make a quick vid / podcast for you.
Calling to unlock the power of boring.
0:31
Do the boring work, whatever it is.
We recently changed out one of our core tenets that Jim launched from go.
The extra mile to do the boring work.
And I think that's been an alignment with what our own team was talking about and I kind of and I just finished the presentation that we're releasing later today to the whole team.
0:47
But even recently, I've had a couple of messages coming in from different gym owners and they're like, man, it really is just about doing the boring work.
And so I kind of wanted to highlight it in a couple different instances.
Different, different lights are examples that I think woodshed Just eliminate it for some people.
So I think that the reason that doing the boring work is one of the most powerful things to unlocking growth is because the underlying principle behind it is the most underrated aspect of success, right?
1:13
Which is consistency.
There's nothing sexy about it, right?
Yet, we recognize it in other people.
We value it in other people, but just doing things, consistently doesn't yield consistent results.
Actually yields parabolic results because of Of the effect of compounding, right?
1:31
And so when you see, like how was it, Einstein said, the eighth wonder of the world is compounding interest, write it?
Because if you gained ten percent year over year over year and you start with $100, you end up like a billionaire like Warren Buffett, right?
Because doing something like if you look at any one of his years, it's never crazy.
1:48
It's just good.
He just never doesn't have those good years.
And so to the same degree like we've been able to grow Jim launched at a very insane rate from the outside, right?
But internally, we're focused on doing the same things every single day, right?
2:06
And doing those same things.
Every single day are boring.
It is not fun to continue to work leads.
It is not fun or sometimes.
It's fun to continue to make ads, right?
It's not fun to have the 19,000 conversation of, you know, a gym owner who's like, well, how do I know this is going to work for me in my market right now like, well, here's 40.
2:24
Other people were in your market and work for them, you know what I mean?
But the point is that if you are, if you're the one having, Now, you're in the trenches, you're doing the block blocking and tackling, right?
There's a lot of times, it doesn't feel special.
And so we start seeking exciting things.
We start seeking things that are shiny and that are new.
2:41
But I can tell you that it hurts having spoken with so many entrepreneurs.
Both from the coaching side and also just like within my network, you can see how successful someone is based on their ability to focus and do the exact same things over and over and over and over again.
2:57
And so there's a book called grit by Andrew.
Duckworth, I may have mentioned it before but I think it's so good.
I think I read the first half of the book in the first sitting, but she was able to unlock the psychology behind success and so, this is something that they've been trying to do for years.
3:14
Dan Gilbert was the cover of a book saying, like people trying to figure it out for decades, right?
They thought it is.
It is it intelligence?
Nope, it's not intelligence.
Is it a?
Is it EQ?
Nope, it's not EQ, is it?
You know, whatever.
It was, right.
Everyone try to figure out.
What's that one thing that makes that sets apart people who are successful for?
3:30
Who aren't right and there's two aspects to grit.
All right?
And that's and that's what she created.
As her index fell, the grit index, or the grit scale, and so, it's a series of questions, it questions, I think if you Google grit scale, you can find it.
But the question is cover two, basic characteristics.
That create grip.
3:45
Create people who are unreasonably successful doing the to whatever they put their hands to, right?
And the two characteristics are how do you deal with failure a and then B?
How how willing are you to stick things out?
4:03
When they suck and not get distracted or start a new project?
So it's the shiny object syndrome on one hand and on the other end is response to failure, right?
And so the people who have extremely high grit, which is the thing that was most positively associated with success, right with accomplishment, where people, who responded, extremely well to failure, didn't even see.
4:24
Failure is failure, just throw it as learning, and who saw new shiny objects as distractions?
That It would take away from their Mastery of the thing that they are already doing right?
And the reason that she because she goes, I mean, she's a whole book about it, right?
But that's the those are the two basic characteristics.
4:40
He tries to tease out in her questionnaire.
Now, the reason that she'd posits that it's such an important quotient is because effort counts twice, and so if you look at achievement, you have talent times effort, equal skill, right?
4:56
So if you have some Talent cool, but if you'll put effort to it, it doesn't become a skill.
Might be decent at math, but if you don't apply yourself, you're never going to learn calculus or whatever, right?
It takes effort to become skilled in something, even if you have talent, right?
And then again, if you, once you have skill, you have to apply effort with that skill to accomplish something, right?
5:17
And so effort, counts twice in the equation of achievement in the equation of accomplishment.
And so all this to say in the business world you can see.
And I guarantee you like, for those of you who are part of our group, For people who are in our community, or who can't even open your eyes and see, you can tell the people who are constantly distracted, right?
5:37
Who every time you talk to them, they're like, yeah, we're doing this new thing, I can tell you every time I hear someone who's doing a new thing in the beginning of my career, I was like, oh, that's so cool.
They're doing stuff.
They're being active button at all.
I just recognized as a sign of 80.
Like I you can't focus.
Like if someone's like, oh yeah, I'm starting this new Venture.
5:53
My God, right.
All right, so I'm guessing the other bunch of didn't work out either in this, probably won't either because you're not going to stick with it, right?
And so, You have to try to unlearn the characteristics that got you to end your first thing to start this business that you are in, right?
But once you have abandoned that first ship to enter this new vehicle, all of what you do has to be about mastering the mundane and doing the shit, that is boring as hell because it compounds, right?
6:18
What'd you get on your to is more than what you get on your one from doing the same thing, right doing the same 10% Improvement.
Your 1 versus your 5 that 5 percent on your are that On your five is so much more than the 10%.
You got it, your one, right?
6:34
Because it compounds.
And so I was talking to Chad scooters do.
So right now he's set himself a huge goal because he's trying to absolutely, I mean, he's already crushing hybrid, he wants to massively crush.
It be number one.
And so when we boil the goal down, I was like, dude, all you got itself, three a day, right?
6:51
Like it's not hard, right?
And it's the same thing with exercise, right?
Like people who are like, man like look how do you how do you get swole, man?
It's like anybody.
Who does one work out like with us?
Is never like, man.
That was the horrible.
I mean, they're like, yeah, that was training.
7:07
But the thing is is that when you want to like massively grow, you just do that same thing every single day and it's not day to that's hard.
It's day 17, it's day 67.
It's day, 127, right?
That's when it gets hard, is because you're bored, right?
7:22
But most people know from the physical training side.
The more volume you do, the more you respond, right?
But the thing is, is it's true on all aspects, The more volume of sales, you do the better, you get at it, right?
The more you make advertised.
If you looked at our marketing departments, advertisements, that we were making nine months ago, compared to the advertisement that we're making right now.
7:42
It's night and day difference, but if you look at it week to week you can barely tell but night and day across More significant periods of time, right?
And so it's that it's the the reason that we underline this in our core tenants is B and we took out go the extra miles because go the extra mile.
7:59
Has this underlie underpinning concept of intensity of like, you know what, I'm going to put the team on my back and I'm going to carry it to the end zone, but then, but then what about tomorrow, right?
Because for us, we would go, the extra mile is just like, that's you should do that.
You should go above and beyond as part of your job.
That's an expectation, right?
8:16
But doing the more I work is whether you can do that consistently right is Doing it day in day out, because consistency matters so much more than intensity any day of the week, right?
Would you rather have that trainer who comes in four days a week, and is late on one, but does great sessions, or would you rather have the guy who's never late, who always shows up on time that always gives you an 8 because it's predictable, right?
8:38
And if you can make your business predictable, then you have a stable business and then you have a business that you can now have less variables that you have to worry about.
You can tweak one thing at a time to improve.
A most efficient quick break just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
8:55
Alright.
So send me a connection request.
A note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
Right.
9:10
But when everything is constantly in a state of flux in a state of chaos, you can never improve because everything is in flux, right?
And so, setting goals that like, like reverse engineering goals is one of the single things that every time I have like Consulting days.
And when I, when I, when I talk to people, like, even on my own team, we were sitting like, you're like, I want to make more money and like, as much as you've probably heard this, some of the people on your still do this, I want to make more money.
9:35
I'm like, what does it mean?
Right, well, I want to Like what do you make now?
I'm not even sure they don't even know what they're making right now.
Okay, cool.
Now you know what you're making, okay.
Going to make ten thousand dollars more than the great.
What do we need to do to make ten thousand dollars more than that?
I need to make an extra, you know, to sales week.
9:53
Okay.
He makes extra true sales week.
How, how did, like, how many sales do you close an average 50%.
Okay, see me for appointments.
Okay, per week extra.
Okay, how do you get your appointments?
Well, I have to set, you know, whatever.
I have to set seven appointments to get for to show.
10:09
Okay, so we need seven appointments to get 4-0 to get too close.
Okay, so now we have seven appointments then if now what percentage of people do you set on appointments 70%?
Okay cool.
So I need 10 leads a day.
Well how much does it cost you to get a lead?
Well it cost me $15.
10:25
Okay so we're spending $150 a day extra to get the to sales to hit my goal.
Awesome.
So let's do that right.
But everyone says like I want to make more but it's like cool then what you need to do is make the ads and spend an extra 150. 50 a day.
To get your extra 10 grand a month.
10:43
Right?
And then you have lifetime value on the other side, right?
But that's the point, is it like, is like that is boring as hell, but making massive growth year over year, right?
Like people look at the numbers that we had.
We did half a million.
We did 5.5 million, we did twenty eight million and if you wondered if we fight.
All right.
10:59
That's, that's that's what I run rate growth has been, but if you look at it week to week, nothing is sexy.
Nothing is special.
Everyone asks us, what's the secrets this you think there is no fucking secret, you know what I mean?
Like we're like we make fresh ads.
Every week, right?
11:14
And we put out good creative that has compelling Hooks and offers that sound interesting with attention grabbing headlines, right.
And we drive those people to appointments and we remind them of their appointments and when they get on the call, we asked them clarifying, questions.
We asked them why they were there.
We figured out what the past things.
They've done, we examine the gap of where they are and where they want to go.
11:32
And we break it down, just like you just did of what you actually need to do actionable e, to achieve what you want, right?
And then we fulfill the promises that we made.
That is it, right?
That is really it.
It and so simple, not easy.
And it's one of the big things that we have in the presentation is that, like most things that are Advanced, right?
11:50
Most of the things that that, that give people these crazy results, are simple, not easy.
Stop eating shit and move, simple not easy.
And so, one of the biggest things that I see is that people discount especially business, owners, discount, simple tactics because it seems simple, right?
12:08
It must be.
It can't be just that.
The thing is that they don't even do the fundamentals.
They don't even do.
The simple things that make you successful, right?
They're expecting that.
It's got to be it's got to be the Infusionsoft crazy follow-up retargeting campaign.
I still don't feel like I've never even seen the emails that we said.
12:26
I have no idea what you said.
I literally have no clue right like because that is not what drives it right?
What drives it is.
It's making compelling heads getting applications in working them to working at least to get him to show up for appointments making sure that we sound like normal human beings on the phone.
12:43
Examine what they need and then matching their need with what we have and we do the same thing and fitness as we do in gym launch, it's all the same right?
And so right now when we looked at Chad's goals use like I really just have to sell to a day.
I was like, yep, it's all we have to do and right now he's every day has just been messaging and he's like, so two more he's like this really is like that's all I have to do.
13:03
That's like, yep.
It's just that people go through these spurts of intense effort, right?
You need to make money.
You need to pay bills.
You need to pay your rent.
Whatever it is, right and then all of a sudden you go all out you like.
Oh, yeah, we're going to You can in Ripon Android, right, and then you hit your goal.
You exhale, you stop and you're like, whew, man.
13:19
Because it's not sustainable, right?
But sustainable progress is actually pretty simple to do, right?
And it compounds far more than these intense bouts of effort, and it gives your business consistency, it gives your business predictability, it allows you to systematize things, allows you to increase your margin because you have consistent Flows In consistent flows out, you know, exactly what's going to happen because you're doing the boring work of making sure that it's going to happen.
13:45
And so, what does that look like for a sales manager, right?
So like coal, for example, was our sales manager crushes, it, he's doing an amazing job.
He's like you totally, like he's done.
Such a good job.
And so what do you call do?
When he came in right?
When he massively increased, the productivity of our sales team?
What did he do?
14:01
He said I don't want to do anything new.
I don't want to change any processes.
I don't want to change any compensation structures.
I just want to hop on one-on-ones with every single of the sales guys.
And I want to coach In role play, and listen to the recordings and give them feedback.
14:16
That is all I'm going to do.
He's like, we're just going to play fundamental football and that is a two and a half X.
The productivity of each of the people on the team to an fx.
Not fifty percent increase, which would have been awesome.
A two-and-a-half X increase per person on the team.
14:34
That is what doing the boring work yields unborn results.
But when you asked him, what did you do?
He's like, well, I did the one-on-ones, I listen to Listen to recordings of each of the sales guys before I would get on the calls.
Have a listing notes of what they could improve on and then I gave them the improvements and then I coach them through it.
14:51
We'd watch some of the the footage together and say, show them where they should have said a different question or their tonality was off your, they talk too much.
They didn't ask enough questions, right?
And and Coach them so that they improve.
That's it, right?
Simple.
Definitely not easy, right?
15:08
And so like I'm hoping that from from this is Tyrant this ranks of doing the other The boring work is that right now in your business, there is boring work that you need to do that.
Will yield The Unborn results that you are after and it is simple and you already know what it is.
You're just choosing not to do it because you think it's too easy but it's not too easy because you're not doing, right?
15:26
And so look at your business, look at the things that you're not consistently doing like it.
Blows me away with your like, I don't always advertisement.
Why like, you're choosing actively to not make money that's a choice.
You're choosing to opt to make less money.
Cool, right?
Okay.
I don't really get it but fine.
15:43
If you do.
These big bouts then it doesn't create consistency because then you have like, okay what we do this one thing for times a year like all right.
Why don't you just do it every week in the year and decrease the flow so that you can give everyone a better experience.
You don't overwhelm yourself and then slowly increase the flow.
So that what used to be a huge bang for you.
16:00
It's now just every day but it doesn't happen overnight.
It happens over weeks and weeks of incremental, improvements of doing the boring work until eventually like we can turn this up and you keep going and you keep going and you keep going.
And that's how you incrementally.
Oof and those incremental improvements are, what absolutely change the game.
16:17
And then when somebody asks you, how the fuck did you grow your gym so fast?
You're like we make ads consistently, we work our leads, we ask clarifying questions, I make sure I meet with my team.
Make sure I give them feedback.
That's productive.
We go over game footage.
We look at what we're doing and we improve right?
16:32
And they're like no no but what do you really do?
And then you get to laugh on the other side of the table.
Because you remember what you were like when you used to ask the same questions wondering what's the magic sauce?
What's the secret?
Because There is no secret.
You get, you get the guys on stage, you see the Billionaire's, they're like, just do the work right there.
16:49
Like just do do the shit, do the boring shit because that's the stuff that makes you money, right?
All the fun stuff is usually something that you money, right?
And so, whoo little ramp but, um, maybe this is what you need to do here today.
I'm not sure.
But anyways, I'm gonna give kudos to our team because we've been doing the boring work.
17:07
So, hats off, we had our best month ever last month.
Highest number of sales lowest amount.
Turn all time, which is phenomenal.
So just like great job and it did it from doing nothing sexy.
But doing all of the boring work and just following the fundamentals and just doing a great job and so maybe you need to pass through today, I don't know what it is but for a like or a comment, hope you have an amazing Thursday.
17:31
And I hope that nothing shiny distracts, you and no failure gets in your way, so that you have the grittiest, you become the grittiest motherfucker around and you can just keep moving forward.
One percent a day every day until all of a sudden you look back, you know, Holy shit.
Look at what we just did.
Alright, have an amazing.
17:46
You guys keep being awesome.
Kitchen soon.









Company0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually a pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect, and let's rock and roll.
0:17
So for whatever reason, my internet cut out and we're starting back in the shop.
So um, this little video I wanted to make is about average cost and revenue per member.
And so I was looking over industry reports from Zen Planner and modify Just to get kind of a bigger pulse of the industry worth moving electron of stuff.
0:33
And I found something else really interesting than I thought, I would share with you, which was especially, as inflator.
They separated out facilities between small medium and large.
And then they also had a category of top or leaders.
Right.
The ones who are making the most money.
What was most interesting to me?
0:49
Was the fact that the cost of fulfillment for all four of those categories was virtually the same.
And the reason that I think that that's incredibly significant, is that The cost more or less remains fixed, right?
It's 80 to 90 dollars per month.
But the difference between the small medium, large and leaders was one thing how much they charged, right?
1:09
And that should be the biggest indication of the growth lever on monetization that pricing has on the business, right?
And so, it wasn't necessary, it wasn't Churn, it wasn't, it wasn't acquisition, it was price, right?
And because with higher prices, you have Meyer profit and with higher profit, you can More money on fulfillment.
1:30
You can say this is longer, you can bump up.
There's all these other things that you can do with more profit.
And so what was interesting to me is that small Jim's had the smallest amount of profit medium.
Jim's had the medium amount of profit large, Jim's had larger amounts than the large medium and small and then the leaders had significantly more margin than the other through like a lot, right?
1:51
And so if you look to the prices it would it was like on average.
I'm throwing rough numbers up was about 80 to 80 80 85.
Fish dollars to fulfill a member for small and then they were charging about $109 per month on average, right?
For the medium, Jim's same cost but they were charging a hundred and sixteen dollars per member.
2:13
And then the large gyms were charging on average, a hundred and twenty four dollars per member.
So you can see the incremental increases and how much money they were charging.
And so, by extension, you can see that they were making more profit per member and it may not seem like much to add $10 but if If you're making $24 versus 35 dollars versus $45 per member, it makes a massive difference because you're talking about a 50% increase in how much profit is being taken home per month.
2:40
All right, that is why pricing is so important.
Now, the coolest one for me was that the industry leaders were not just an incremental amount higher but significantly higher.
And so the industry leaders right there cost or how much they were charging per member was between 50 percent.
2:56
It was 50%.
Higher than everyone else.
All right, so if the small guys were charging 110, the the leaders were charging 150 to 170 per month, okay?
And so that extra 30, $40 per month that they're charging is all profit.
3:17
And so they were actually able to make three four times as much money in take-home money based on their pricing, right?
And that's why pricing is so important.
That's why discounting is also, so, not good for your business.
And so one of the other trends that they saw across the board is that the leaders didn't really do any discounts and the people who struggle the most for the ones who always sold with this X.
3:37
And so, if you can incorporate that in the behaviors, that you have with your gym in your business, you will be able to profit in the beautiful things that this is just the data, right?
Like, it doesn't care how you feel about it.
If you're like, well, I'm special my markets, different blah, blah, blah, no one cares, right?
It doesn't matter.
So take that into consideration when you're looking to pricing your business.
3:56
If you're like, I'm if you look at the Ages of how much you're charging per member, and it's falling in that 110 to 130 range.
That it means that you're going to be on the more average side.
If you want to be an industry leader, then do what the industry leaders do in charge on average $150 plus per member, which means that's the average are things that they have people who are much higher than if you shoot for that as your top number, you're going to fall below them.
4:19
All right?
And so that's why for us, it's your lunch.
We tell everyone that their pricing should be between 167 and to 12 per month, which rolls out to $39 per week to $49 per week.
Fascinating to me, is that if I make a video about motivation, don't give up like, don't quit whatever, we get tons of Engagement, tons of likes, tons of comments, and all that kind of stuff.
4:37
Like this is amazing.
When I make this stuff that actually makes people more money.
They're not interested, right?
Which goes to show you where people put their attention, right?
It's not on the things that actually drive the business that drive kpi's.
And then people ask themselves, why am I not making money?
Why am I not?
4:52
You know, why am I not growing the way I want to?
It's because you're not paying attention to things that actually drive the business, right?
The kpis that matter and so the big the big toy take away for me here, probably the biggest one was that the cost across all of them per member was basically identical cost is basically the same Most Nation real quick.
5:16
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to fifteen hundred dollars.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
5:35
And so, when you look at that and for me that just gives me this huge sense of relief and like certainty that then it's just a question of how much money do I want to make.
And that's a choice that you get to have, which is how much money do I want to make per customer and you the beauty of it is that you get to set that price.
5:52
It's totally up to you.
And what's funny is that we as business owners will complain, that people don't pay us enough and yet we're the ones who set the fucking price.
Right.
And so anyways, if you hear this and you're like, okay, this is how much it cost me her number, right, and how much do you want to make on top of that?
6:10
And so the incremental amounts, if you go from, let's say, 90 dollars cost per member, and you go from $120, a month to 100 and let's say, fifty dollars a month, that may sound like, oh, it's only thirty dollar difference.
And if you break that up on a weekly basis, you're looking at adding like seven dollars per week.
6:26
Doesn't sound like a big increase, right?
But that seven dollars per week, do?
Doubles. 2x your profit doubles, right doubles your profit.
And so when you do things like this, these are the things that have massive bottom line implications that aren't that difficult to implement within your business.
6:44
And so that is why if we're to bring this thing full circle.
That is why I'm I get so pumped about hybrid because with hybrid, if you get 30% of the people to take you up on an extra $49, a week for 101 remote coaching right, that you can add on top of any facility, Right.
7:01
Then that overall translates to 70 dollars more per month.
I just showed you a 30 dollars more per month did, but it translates to 70 dollars more per month per member.
All right, so that is two, two, two, two point, whatever. 3x with the, the 2x was.
7:17
All right.
And so that is where you go from making $30 per month per member, which on average is what the reports were looking at which confirms which with our internal survey data is almost the same to of people coming in is between 30 and 35 dollars in profit per member.
And if you can add 70 dollars to that, you go from 1 x 2, 3 x, that means U 3x.
7:36
How much money you make by implementing one change and how you fulfill your services and what service levels you offer?
All right?
And again, I'm going to say it.
This was about math, which means it's a boring, right?
It means that people who the guys who dig this type of content are the ones who make the most money.
7:54
The people who don't engage in this stuff are the ones who are always wondering why they can't make a profit every month because they want to have another motivational Manifesto.
They want to have a don't quit keep, you know, keep going fight the good fight and like I make that content because we need to, we need to have engagement but this is the stuff that matters, right?
8:10
And so anyways, hope you guys use this and take this data and implement it in your business so you can make more money.
All right.
Have an amazing day.
Keeping awesome.
Lots of love and I'll catch you guys on foot.









0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
Good morning, everyone will be receiving a fan.
Fantastic friday.
Today I wanted to talk about something that has been.
It's been on my docket for a while, but today felt like the right day.
So calling this fuck end of week.
0:43
And what I mean by that is one of the one of the things that I've seen across the board when we're talking to you entrepreneurs.
And, you know, the, the gym owner of community that we have.
Is that the one trait I see over and over again, that is clear to the people who are our winners.
1:00
Right?
The top 1%.
I'm not talking top. 10% of the top 1% is the speed with, which they execute after making a decision.
And so one of the definitions that, like, we talked about in communities, that definition of power, as I understand, it is, The gap between thoughts becoming reality.
1:19
And so if you thought about an omnipotent being, write something, someone has unlimited power as they think that thing would be right?
And so, if you were to believe in a creator of some sort than you might think as that Creator, thought the universe became, right?
1:35
And so, if you think that is like the ultimate scale of power, then the closer we can get to that.
The more powerful we become the more potent, we are as entrepreneurs, and so, I see this so many times.
Times that it's not even, it's not even a no, like, this is associated with success.
1:51
Like this is what creates success because the gap between where you decide, something is a good idea and when it actually occurs is the loop with which you can improve your business and so it's it's a lot like I can remember the saying was but it's not like how old the cars but by how many miles are on it.
2:11
What I mean by that is like We're Young, right?
But there's been a lot of a lot of iterations.
Happened from, you know, when the business first started, when I started my first game until now and I think the key to that is the speed of the ooda loop.
And that's that's just a military term like observe Orient, decide act and it's just the loop with which that you can basically see what's going on.
2:33
Make a decision act on it and then do that whole loop again, right?
Because the faster you can pivot and iterate.
The more responsive.
You are an entrepreneur, the fast you can take advantage of opportunities.
The faster you can find out what failures are at then move on, right?
Right?
And so I want to talk about this within the context of running, a team and employees and then also within yourself and so from running your team, right?
2:56
One of the things that, you know, once once you're moving out of you doing things all the time, there's how do I get other people to do things?
And so that's why I called this, like, fucking of week, right?
Is that I one of the things, one of my biggest pet peeves is like, yeah, I can get you that, by, by end of week I'm like, why don't you just get it to me in an hour?
3:12
Because that's how long it takes.
And then all of a sudden, it's like, oh, it's like, well, I have a meeting, right?
Then it's like, is it more important?
This know?
Okay, well, then do it, right?
And you can speed like, if you think about how you can run an organization like that, if you can get things done end of day, right?
3:29
Rather than end of week, you were literally speeding up.
The organization 7x, think about that.
And so, when you're thinking about deadlines, if you're thinking about expectations, you as the owner can set the use of the Cadence if people say hey can Do this and then you're like cool.
3:45
Let's start right now.
You set the tone for how the organization is going to move, right?
How quickly it's going to orient, how quickly thoughts become reality and ultimately how powerfully organization will become because of the speed right at speed isn't doing things fast.
It's basically just not being distracted by other shit.
4:02
That doesn't matter.
It's being able to prioritize right and most people a lot of the times aren't doing something that's high priority, right?
A lot of times they're just doing nothing right?
And so if You can, if you can speed up that Loop and Force and and put apply pressure to your team to not do things by end of week or even end of day.
4:23
It's like, it's 10 a.m., can you get this done by noon, okay.
And then you can have that Loop happen three times within a day rather than it taking three weeks, right?
Because you set that Cadence from the beginning and then things get done faster.
I was talking to.
4:39
So I've been reading some really interesting books lately and I refer them out too.
A handful of my friends that I have that are all doing 55 to 15 million kind of in that range.
And what was amazing to me is that every single one of them read the book immediately set me back their notes and what they were going to do with it and act like and basically we're asking feedback on on the angle that they were going to take with it.
5:03
And what's fascinating to me is that if you look at if you look at lower level entrepreneurs they and I'm not saying that in a negative way, I'm just saying in terms of just objective Revenue, just having tea Just much the the delay between being able to gain information and act as so much longer and that's why they have where they want to be, right?
5:23
And so it's kind of the same degree people who are like pay for our program and haven't gone through the podium.
Like, what are you doing, right?
Like what priority like?
What, what education you have that is not relevant to your business.
Like you're reading a motivational blog right now when you have to translate that motivation into a thought that you're then going to quote test.
5:42
And then you have to see how that test.
It works and then maybe to improve something rather than just following the Playbook that has already been tested and has already like the tree has been shook, right?
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
6:00
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I catch the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
6:22
And so if you look at like Joey, for example, who by all definitions is Jim's, the is the number-one gym within Jim wants, right?
He was, he had already finished everything in Legacy by week, 8.
His first eight weeks, he'd already implemented every single system and Legacy.
6:41
And so it's not like, it's not like he has more hours in the day, right?
It's not like his business is different.
It's just that his level of efficacy in execution was so high because it allowed himself to get distracted by things and the moment he has something needs to execute its creates this kitchen side of him that he cannot.
6:58
He can't move forward without executing this.
So that the relief And if you can start to Foster that type of behavior in yourself in those attitudes about execution, you will grow faster and you will become more powerful as an entrepreneur, right?
7:14
If you think about your competition, who would you fear, right?
The competitor, who sees what you're doing, can immediately execute Implement and improve on it at a faster Loop than you can even understand what's going on.
Right.
And that's where speed of first and market and things like that.
7:29
Don't matter as much because if an X if a competitor could Execute an outer loop, right?
Kankan speed that Loop up faster, they can iterate improve on it fast as you can and then you have no chance to catch up, right?
And so if you're looking at your business, look at it from a context of speed of how long does it take us to improve things, right?
7:47
How long from understanding that our turn is high to executing the five Horsemen?
Right, how long did that take, we knew what the problem was.
How long did it take for us to do?
And if you can if you can if you can get real with yourself about how many actual hours, it will take to do something.
And then you look You're weak and you think.
8:04
Okay, what am I doing today?
That is more important than this and where can I put these two hours and start with the moment that you make the decision?
And then all of a sudden, you'll be getting things, done that day that afternoon, rather than end of week, end of month, right?
We purposely delay these things because we just procrastinate for no reason when the, the problem will not go away, right?
8:26
And so, that is why within Jomon speed is King, is one of the core tenets of the business.
Because like You have to, and the tone has to start with you as the entrepreneur.
Like, you have to apply that pressure.
You have to say, Fuck end of week.
Why like, what are you doing today?
8:41
This more important is, right?
What are you doing in the next?
Two hours is more important in this tell me, right?
And a lot of times you'll get the answer like well I guess I can do it now.
It's like yeah.
Then let's do it now.
Let's get it done right and that small change can 7x, right?
If you even go in from end of week to end of day, can 7x how quickly your business grows because the solutions that you Implement to solve the problems and break through the bottlenecks happened today, not in a week, not in a month and then the reaction to the next thing, that breaks the next bottleneck in the business happens not in a week, not in a month, but in a day.
9:16
And then that's how quickly you can pivot from where you are to where you want to go.
Because it's not one big thing, it's a million, small turns that will get you there.
So anyways, I hope I hope anyone, you know, somebody found value in this if you have an employee or you're managing your team and you want to implement new things, Start with today, right?
9:34
Start with end of dead, not end of week, start with end of the next two hours, and then work backwards from there.
And then apply pressure and push back on excuses for why something else, why something can't be done asked for why?
9:50
Why do you think this thing that you're going to do is more important than this?
And I want a real answer, right?
And if they can't give you a real answer then it means that I need to help you prioritize and that's fine.
But this is now going to be your priority because this is Drives Revenue.
This is what drives our attention.
This is going to drive the business.
10:06
So Look at your schedule identify the bottlenecks you have and then start doing them now, not in tomorrow, not in a week not in a month because there's no point.
It's just the speed with which you can Close the gap between your thoughts and your decisions and the reality that you create in front of you, will dictate how powerful you are as an entrepreneur and even as a human being.
10:29
So, anyways, have an amazing day, have a fantastic Friday for my chemours.
I will see you guys on the call later today.
Otherwise keep being awesome tag like comment, All That Jazz.

Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.

It's going on everyone, happy Wednesday.
Hope you guys are rocking your week so far.
Today, I want to make a video that I have had on my mind that have been marinating and I had like this is kind of a cold.
Nation like three or four things that I'm just kind of putting together and I think it's gonna turn out well and I'm still struggling with the name for this video so maybe we'll see what what it turns out to be.
0:39
But it kind of stem from just just a few different, you know, small minor situations that kind of bubbled into this overarching concept which is like if shit happens do you overcome shit or do you become shit?
And what I mean by that is that like a lot of times there's a saying like bad things happen in threes and if you've ever heard that like bad things happening, Reason.
1:00
I actually think there's a lot of Truth to the saying, and I don't think it's because of some karmic force or some Universal force of Threes that sends - things your way, but because people become shit, when ships happens to them.
And so the, if you look at like Champions and so like I like using that term because I just love the world champion but Champions are unreasonable in how they bounce back from failure and how they bounce back from shit happening, right?
1:27
Adrian Peterson, tore his ACL which is an end.
No career-ending injury for just about everyone and then comes back and almost sets the the record for the NFL in rushing it right.
You know, Lance Armstrong gets test doc, you know, singular cancer, and then and then all of a sudden wins, you know, the Tour de France, a bunch of times, right?
1:46
And so it's because like those guys are have the mindset of Champions, which is there are most people where it would be reasonable for them to have shit happen to get cancer.
To blow your ACL to have your business partner, Leaf to have your trainer leave with Whatever it is right for you and then for you to have your life, go to shit.
2:05
And so, recently, we had, I had a, there's a team member of ours, who had just had a bunch of personal things happen to him in his normal life, right?
And the problem was, is that after that happened, it affected his work and then his performance started to slip.
2:24
And so then we had to let him go.
And so the, the difficult and I can think I'm thinking about is perception of life in the universe and the world and because he acted in a completely reasonable way.
He was completely distraught, he was extremely upset, it bubbled into his work, it bubbled into his life.
2:41
I'm sure if he had a girlfriend or maybe he doesn't ever go, I don't know.
Like, I'm sure it affected that relationship to and maybe, you know, she will then see him and say like man, you're not the way you used to be anymore, you're always - always down on yourself and then she breaks up with him and it's like, oh my God, this band up a couple weeks.
I had, you know, this horrible thing happened and I got fired from my job and then my Broke up with me.
3:00
But the reality is that they're all connected, right?
And so the saying like what doesn't kill you makes you stronger is not true because for most people what doesn't kill them, makes them weaker, right?
It just injures them even more and more and more.
And you look at the people who are at the end of their life versus the beginning of their life.
3:16
And what ends up happening is they just look beat up and used, right?
Because they didn't they let these situations that happened to them in their life beat the strength out of them rather than beat the strength into them.
Right?
And so I think that's the fundamental difference that happens between like champions.
He's right.
It's like do you let the world?
3:32
Do you let life be the strength out of you or beat it into you?
And for me, a lot of it is the story that we choose to tell ourselves and so like and I probably said this thick in this way but like, if something really bad happens, I get this weird amount of excitement because I am excited about the story that I'm going to be able to tell based on this low and how I overcame.
3:56
And so there are people who get broken up with and then games Three pounds and become, you know, Hermits and live inside, which is a completely reasonable human response, but it doesn't make you a champion.
It makes you reasonable.
Make sure you normally make sure like everyone else.
And so, if you want the things that everyone else doesn't have, you have to act in ways that everyone else doesn't actin, which means you have an unreasonable response to trauma and unreasonable response to pain.
4:19
And it's that not only are you as good as you were before but you're better you double down.
You say I'm not going to let this thing affect this and to go over and above.
I'm going to sink myself into this.
Thing and go all in on that to make it a positive instead of a negative.
And So within the psychology World they call it sublimating which means basically taking transferring energy from like a negative to a positive.
4:40
So that's where let's say, somebody was an addict, right?
Will quit their addiction but then they throw themselves into an addiction to Fitness, right?
Which if you're, if you're comparing cocaine or heroin addiction to working out a lot, it's a much better addiction, right?
4:55
And so it's called sublimating.
So they're taking their the thing that used to help them cope with stress.
That was a The tractor and then puts it into something that was positive because we all cope, right?
Like that happens.
No matter what independent who you are.
If you have a trauma, you will cope.
It's just how do you cope?
How do you cope with shit?
5:12
Like, do you let that become the impetus?
The story of how you're not going to lose, how you're going to win, no matter what the circumstances are, right?
If your partner leaves, you and takes 50% of the business, or are you going to let that be the story of why you failed, because then you can tell everyone when you fail.
5:29
Hey Hey, my partner took out my business and then my business failed and ball ball ball, right?
And everyone will be like, Aw poor you like and and they would be right in saying that and you would be reasonable and having that be a reason they went out of business, right?
But at the end of the day doesn't matter because what matters is who wins in the end, that's it, right?
5:47
And so one of the, this is what I'm going to circle to is what was going to be a commentary on a different video, but I think it wraps.
So well into this is that everyone perceives pain.
The same.
And what I mean by that is what one rich girl who gets brought up in a spoiled household when her dad doesn't show up to her brother, you know, her ballet performance.
6:13
It could be a 10/10 trauma for her, right?
And then on the flip side, you hear someone who was raised on the other side of the train tracks, who was just happy, that her dad, remembered her name, right?
Or was just happy that your dad showed up once every month, right?
And and you can see Juxtaposition and externally we want to give it absolute judgment on how much pain did they really experienced but humans don't work that way.
6:40
Hey, if you're a return listener and you have not rated or reviewed the show, I want you to know that you should feel absolutely terrible about yourself and everything else in the world kidding.
But it would mean the absolute world to me.
If you guys would go ahead and do that, you don't even have to pause the show, you keep listening and you can just do with your thumb right now.
It'll take you less than 60 seconds.
6:55
And like I said, the only way that podcast grows through word of mouth and this is you joining hands with me and helping as many isomers with possibly can because no one is coming to save us, it's just us.
All right, so please go do that now then let's get back to the show.
They don't work it, absolute sets in relative scales and for that person, the pain may have been the same.
7:17
It may have even been higher for the ballet, girl, because expectations are the things that yield pain when they're not met right.
If you look at suicide rates between ethnicities, there are a propensity of suicides among very high earning very what would be considered successful like white and Asian like ethnicities?
7:37
There's a higher suicide, right?
Higher SES higher socioeconomic.
It's does so to say that you like to trying to trying to track from someone's pain because of the absolute thing that happened to them is irrelevant and doesn't actually address the fact that pain is pain to everyone.
7:56
And so for you in your circumstance you are 10 out of 10.
Pain is the same as everyone else's.
And so the question is, how do you react to your 10 out of 10 pain?
And how you react is going to predicate, whether you become a champion or not.
8:12
And that's it.
And I think for me the biggest coping mechanism that has been, this has been useful in times that have been hard is What story do I want to tell?
What story do I want?
Told about me in these situations right?
8:28
When I was sleeping on the floor, the first gym it was really hard for me, right?
It was very hard, but I kept thinking, I'm going to be able to say it came from this, right?
I'm going to be able to say I came from this to go to where I wanted to go, right?
And so It's just like when you have the husband, who cheats on your the wife who cheats on you or the person who breaks up with you or whatever it is, there's there is the reasonable thing to do which is to fail, which is to suck and that's what most people do.
8:56
And that's why things happen that are bad in strings of things, right?
They get broken up with then they lose their job and then then then you know, all of these other things happen but because they let one thing affect everything rather than letting one thing make them stronger, right?
And so At the end of all of this, I guess I kind of just wanted to say that the market doesn't care, right?
9:17
Your, your coworker doesn't care.
Your, your lover, your boyfriend, your wife, on some level, doesn't care what I mean by that.
Is that like, it's not, it's not in a, like, Bosch Humanity way but like people are self-serving, the reason a lot of times people end up together is because the way that you make them feel about themselves, That's the difference.
9:40
Most people a lot of times feel like well I Unconditionally Love exercising a lot of parents like I Unconditionally Love my child like you say you but you really don't if they if they came and they burn down your house and started just going into all of the things that you hate in the world became a criminal record.
9:56
And basically, so far beyond that people would say it was reasonable for you to give up on them.
Most people would write most people would, you know, your child's a Serial murderer.
Whatever it is right, there are There's in my opinion, there's no such thing in the human world of unconditional.
10:13
There are conditions just were able to push further for family, but it doesn't mean it's unconditional and so do the same degree.
The people you work with your clients, your business partners, whatever it is have conditions.
And so, despite the fact that you might be right, and you can tell your friends, and you can tell your mom and you're like, you wouldn't believe all the stuff that happens.
10:33
And she's like, oh, honey, I'm so sorry for you.
No one gives a shit.
No one cares.
And so if you except that and realize that you were excuse of what happened is irrelevant to the outcome that you want, then you can kind of, in some way, get piece about the fact that cool, what story are people going to tell about this situation?
10:51
Because when you have that low you have the potential to have a higher high.
I'm going to say this in a different way.
When you have that horrible thing happened to you, there are two stories that can be told, right?
If there's the guy that nothing happens to and then he successful, the story is not nearly Compelling not nearly as, as inspiring, right?
11:13
As status producing as a story where someone lost it and then and then despite that succeeded any way through grit and tenacity, which big secret everyone was at the top succeeded despite that because bad shit happens to everyone, right?
11:28
It rains, don't loser like you know Fortune rains on the good in the bad.
Even totally butchering that.
But you get, you get what I'm saying here and so The question is once it happens, do you want the story to be a?
11:44
He succeeded, or she succeeded?
Despite those horrible things that happen to her, or him, or do you want the story to be sheer?
He failed and it's reasonable, like, oh poor them, I can't believe all that stuff happened to them boohoo and then they just move on with their day because no one cares, and the end of the day, the goal that you have is going to be the other side of the story that you were going to not only I have told about you but that you will be telling yourself and so that that story is going to be.
12:15
The thing that when you do achieve the Mountaintop, you will be able to look at people with certain conviction about not being concerned about the future because you know what you have gone through in the past and most people have gone through shit in their past.
We all have that should give you strength to face, what's coming and so use that.
12:34
When you have shit that happens to you, if you have the partner that leaves think yourself, was this harder than my My dad beating me every day, right?
I'm not saying my dad.
My dad ever touch me, but I'm saying, the point is everyone has that story, right?
And ask yourself.
Is it harder than that?
No, I overcame.
12:50
Anyways, right, so I can do this too.
And this is the story that I choose to tell and I'm going to double down harder than I ever did and use this as fuel to win harder and that is what separates the champions from the not.
And that's why most people aren't changing because they crack under pressure and then next thing that happens is bad.
13:07
Next thing that happens about and then everyone says poor You, it's so reasonable that.
You think so my the inspirational tone for the message is just that shit's going to happen and it's just a question of what story you want to tell about it.
13:23
And whether you're going to use that to make you stronger or let it make you bigger.
So hope you guys have an amazing Wednesday.
This was just spurred on by a couple of just like internal things that happened, you know.
It was just the one story, you know somebody in our company and I just I thought it'd be to be said and I Hope that maybe there's somebody here, who has gone through some things, or maybe, you know, someone else is going through things and you can relay that message to them so that they can make.
13:47
It make them stronger, beat the strength into them rather than beating the strength out of them.
So lots of love, keeping amazing photographer end, like all that kind of stuff and love you all amazing day.
If you soon,

What's going on, everybody?
I'm bringing some more books, but I wanted to say that, if you haven't checked out Hunter million-dollar offers, I would definitely suggest that you start there.
I've gotten some solid feedback and it couldn't be happier with its.
Number one ranking on Amazon for direct marketing and over 5,000, five star reviews.
So, thank you guys so much for that.

I really can help you out.

So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
Good morning, everyone.
Happy Sunday.
0:30
Hope you guys are rocking and rolling on your restful and of weekend.
Beginning of prep for the week.
I came off a really great week.
Got a lot of stuff done.
And I was among those was writing something that I'm calling the hybrid.
Manifesto, I'm playing around the title, but more or less kind of a very in-depth look at, you know, industry Trends where we're looking, what's going on now, that kind of thing and in writing the hybrid Manifesto.
1:00
It became clear when I got to the last section.
Just kind of like, what do you do now, right?
What is the path ahead?
One of the choices that you need to make given different scenarios Etc.
And so when I was looking at that, it became clear that there is really only one choice that needs to happen and then there's just two paths that split off of that.
1:18
And so it was good for me because I you know, when we first launched hybrid I was like there's five kind of different scenarios and then developing it more I was like well these two are kind of similar this just applied differently.
So there's really four and Then going from, for now, it really comes down to, like, one side for Choice and then, two paths, and so if you'll allow me, I'll show you share with you what those are.
1:38
And so, the single question that has to be answered at the beginning.
Before you go down the path of when you want to convert into a hybrid facility or not, it's simply Duval.
I want to have an engine training Community, that's it.
If you want to have an engine train Community, you want to keep, you know, keep the engine experience.
2:00
Cetera.
You love that.
And that's amazing.
That's awesome.
Then there's one really clear path that you need to go down right on the flip side.
If you say, you know what, I don't need that necessarily.
I just like getting clients results and I don't have an in-person requirement to actually watch them work out at my facility, then there's a second half and so I'll go down both so if you want to keep your facility and the community and the training that you have intact at your facility, then Then the only thing that you are going to do is simply add it as an additional level of service, which is what we call bolt on.
2:36
So, instead of or in lieu of having a semi-private training, which you might have, and that's what I espouse for really long time, instead of needing to spend the money on the equipment spent use the extra square, footage deal, with scheduling and Logistics around trainer for somewhere privates, you can have the same Revenue per customer except and the same profit profession because hcps.
2:58
Also, 20% goes Coach.
And so, both of them are actually the same in terms of profit, it's simply that with hybrid.
You don't have all of the constraints that are associated with it and so you would take your existing customer base, you'd add an additional level of service, which is bolt on.
And then from an acquisition standpoint, when someone comes in, all, you're simply doing is offering them a choice, right?
3:20
And this is the long-term sustainable way of doing this, because you say, you get to the end of the sale.
And you'd say, listen, you can do this at predefined times in a a group at our facility, or would you prefer to do this one-on-one with me at your own convenience, right?
3:36
And that's simply the question.
So you everything up to that point is the same, so it's the same external promotion.
You don't need to change anything there.
You don't need to change your landing pages.
When they come in, you don't need to change your pitch.
You literally just say at the end of this, which you prefer to do X, or prefer to do, why, right?
3:53
A be right in the nice thing is that it's in a be closed, it's an assumed sale and it's relatively prescriptive.
And so you simply Just say, do you want to do this as workouts in a group here at predefined, predefined times in the gym?
Or would you rather work out with me?
4:09
Individually 101 at your own expense outside of the gym at your own convenience.
Right?
And then from there a personal pick the thing that matches their there that suits their needs right.
And so that is the sustainable Way Forward for Jim's who want to keep their gym, keep the community, keep the in training workouts, all of that kind of stuff.
4:28
That means that all you're doing is Is you add the additional level to your existing members, which means you're ascending them.
So you add your profit per member, which will massively increase that made other videos about just adding that level of service to your existing membership base, makes you more money but then from an acquisition standpoint so that your gym does not die out because you're feeding only one thing.
4:47
When they come in, you give them the option, A, or B.
Which one would you prefer?
And then you move on your Merry way.
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
5:02
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
5:22
And with those situations, you can actually sell both to, you can sell them in the in-person workouts and then also attack on bolt on our hybrid, on top of that.
So you can actually get your EFT or of $400 a month for that client with really no additional costs.
5:38
So that is kind of like, after writing through the writing through this entire manifest, there's about 100 Pages.
Like that was kind of the distillation of like if you want to keep your gym, this is the best way to do it.
Now, the second scenario is you say, I don't need to keep my gym in person.
5:54
I'm not married to that.
I'm, I prefer the 101 or closer relationships, Etc.
I'm happy to cut my cover, my overhead etcetera.
Then really, if you there's like, in that one, there's two steps in areas.
And this is how you can see how I got multiple scenarios, but there's really just two sub scenarios.
6:10
If you are in favor of a long-term full hybrid model, then it's just, do you have a gym already or do you not have a gym if you have a gym already?
Then what you have to do is essentially started as a side business.
What I mean by that is that you're going to continue to Market and sell but you're not going to be feeding the in-person business.
6:30
You're sickling to be stacking up your hybrid or side business, right?
A side, hustle version.
And then the nice thing is because the profit is so high on this one, this will essentially cover the decrease that will happen in your main business because you're no longer feeding it.
Right.
And so as this one increases eventually, there will be a time or a moment where the revenue from this and the profit from this.
6:50
Far exceeds the profit-making from your main business and the fixed cost that you have associate with it.
And then at that point, you can make the transition from an in-person facility to a full hybrid facility.
And so that is where I'm in a lot of our gyms have gotten to that point already and they're making a tradition etcetera.
7:07
So you want to build this up if I want to give you like overarching numbers, I think you should shoot for 50 to 75 hybrid clients before making the full switch.
This is just having done this with a lot of gyms now and walks, plenty of them through that process.
SS 75 seems to pretty much cover you.
7:23
I said at a minimum 50 but the more the merrier, because if you're doing 75 clients were paying you, $400 a month, you're more than covered, and really the rest of that will now be pocket money, because you're eliminating, all the costs that were associated with the old business.
All right?
So if we have our original choice, do you want to keep the gym in the in-person training?
7:43
Do you want to not keep it?
We already covered.
If you want to keep the in-person training and then we entered into If you don't want to keep it and we just cover, if you have a job.
So what happens if you don't have a facility?
So this would be people who have like personal trainers or people were starting hybrid facilities.
So, this is you, it works the exact same way except you don't have to deal with the other business at the same time.
8:04
So in some sense is you have an advantage of not having to kind of deal with some of the mental attention split of having to keep this one kind of going.
While, you're really focusing, your attention on feeding this side business, right?
So for you, it wouldn't be a side business, it would be the main business and someone posted in here earlier, where they Just they started their gym as a full hybrid facility and that's the beauty of it.
8:24
There's not a lot of overhead.
And so all of the sales that come in are just pure profit which is fantastic.
And so that's kind of the way that I see this crystallizing out is that the existing gym becomes more profitable by adding?
The said no argument and it becomes logistically easier because there's no equipment.
8:41
Outlay, for micash standpoint, you don't have to put square footage and allocate that.
So you don't have to decrease your class sizes, and you don't have to deal with scheduling and coordinating.
Traders, right?
So which is all the downsides of semi-private right now summer privates great.
It's just that those are those are some of the costs associated with it.
8:58
And so hybrid gets you all the benefits of an HTP type setup.
Our high ticket program has set up for semis, except you don't have to deal with all the other stuff.
So pretty much any Group Training Facility can add this as an additional service, make more money, really not change anything, fundamental about the gym, even the acquisition just becomes an a be closed which direction they want to go and you feed both businesses simultaneously which allows you to keep above average, If it's by a long shot compared to facilities that are executing that and then the alternative is you want to go full hybrid.
9:27
You like that model of just having a very small fixed cost with the rent and then having twenty percent cost that's variable that goes up as you scale more clients and goes down if you have less and then in that case you either transition by building that up.
So that it can replace your existing revenue and then cutting that one off.
9:42
And then keeping this, or if you don't have one, just building it from the onset as a full hybrid facility with no in-person training.
So anywho.
I hope that clarifies it for anybody who is unclear.
I know that I've had multiple scenarios that I think some of the case studies that we have have five scenarios.
10:00
I think this kind of distills it down into really the one, the one decision that needs to be made, do I want to keep in-person training?
Do I not want to keep in-person training?
And then if you and then once you've made that decision, the path is fairly straightforward, Right?
Add additional level of service, a be closed on the front end and then or just feed 100 The new business, let that one cover the costs of the old business.
10:22
Until eventually you can shut down the cost of the old business and then reap all the rewards and profit of the new and that is all.
So I hope you guys have an amazing son dae-ho that answered some of the questions that you might have had surrounding hybrid.
I love the question.
So thank you.
Keep them coming.
I get, I get them all over the place, so I try to do my best to kind of consolidate them into simple framework.
10:41
So have an amazing day, keeping amazing.
And we say, amazing what times?
All right.
Fuck.
You see back?









0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
Good morning everyone.
Happy Tuesday.
I hope you have a terrific start to your Tuesday.
I wanted to make this video because I had a conversation with Layla for lovely, Leila about work today.
And we were talking about not work as in the work that we need to do but work as a concept in general in the things that we get done and it went in an interesting Direction so I won't thought I'd bring it up for everyone here and maybe tag somebody who potentially identifies with one stage of the work that will go through.
0:56
So we were talking about how Like could we have a single predictor that we could look at like one single stat?
We could look at that, would dictate How likely someone is to succeed with your lunch, over a long period of time, right?
And so it's kind of like to the a backup before I get into the four stages.
1:15
If you look at, let's say the financial planning industry, like if you want to become a financial planner to become a successful financial planner, they know the math, it takes $200 a day and that's what you need to do.
It takes three years for you to build up a book of business.
That after a point, you know, Years.
You could live off of the wealth management side that you would have built up.
1:34
During that first three years, you're selling insurance, and you're getting single pops off the insurance to carry you over, until that you're three Mark, most people fail.
It's like an 80% plus failure rate before the three-year Mark now is being a financial planner scam. 80% of people plus don't make it.
1:56
Is it a scam or do some people just not have what it takes to be successful.
It's a fair question, right?
So the question for us is like, how can how can we figure out who is going to have, what it takes to make it?
2:11
And one of the interesting things about Jim launch, is that and I've noticed this trend People will come in having owned a gym for six years, seven years, eight years, whatever it is.
And then within one year of working with us, at the end of that time, will either be successful or say they realized?
2:31
They're not sure they want to be in the gym business because what happens is up to that point the success is mysterious it's mystified it's it's you know, weird it's weird systems that you don't know about, right?
But with Jim launch the The success path is extremely.
2:49
Well defined like this is what you need to do, right?
And this is what you need to do, consistently in order to achieve X, right?
And what happens is, there's no longer a mystery of what it takes to win and then it forces people to confront whether or not they want to do that.
3:07
And so once they confront that it's either a yes or no.
And if it's a yes and they do it and then they succeed and then they have the business that they want, right?
Or it's a no and then They realize that, oh my gosh, it's not that.
I don't know what to do anymore.
I do know what to do.
I just I'm not sure if I want to do it.
3:23
And that's a totally different question.
But the nice thing is that I can promise you that.
By the time you're with us, you will know exactly what it takes to be successful in the gym business, and then it is up to you whether or not you want to do it.
And so the circle back to the original thing that I was starting with was, how do people work right?
3:40
What's that one step?
And Layla was bringing up that when she started working with me she said she was like I didn't really know.
Hard work.
Looks like like I worked a lot of hours but I didn't understand like hard work looks like and so we always tell the story about when she did her first.
3:56
Jim watch with me, she was supposed to shout at me and kind of see how it worked in went out before, she would do wrong.
And so, it was one of the first days of the launch.
And I was in the back.
I think I was telling someone was making calls are doing something right, and she was supposed to be working at least at that time.
And so she spent two hours straight calling all the leads, and I don't remember how many leaves me at that point.
4:17
And she came to the back and she was like, Hey, you know, I'm done call the Links and she was like, really proud of herself.
And, and I was like, she looked at me like, so I'm going to kind of like, chill or whatever.
I was like, great call them again and she was like, what I was like, start the top start over and she's just like, really, and you could see like the joy just drained from her face, because she was like, it became real for her in that moment.
4:45
The reason that we were averaging like the launches that she and I would do we have its 200 plus sales in 21 days, right?
Is because the level of effort that went into doing the repeatable, like the repeated tasks.
We just maxed out, right?
And so what I wanted to work through is just like what I think are kind of the four different, like levels of kind of work ethic, right in the beginning.
5:11
You don't even know how to work really.
Like your, you don't even understand the Concept of how to work, you may have employees.
Right now, there may be some people watching this, who literally don't even get what it means to work hard.
They think they work hard, right?
She said, when she started, she was working a lot of personal training hours and she thought she knew how to work hard, but just being somewhere and just existing is not hard, right?
5:37
You show up.
That's not difficult because you're forced to be there.
What's hard?
Work is where you don't have someone looking at?
At you and you have shit that needs to get done.
That is not pleasant.
And sometimes, as repeatable effort that you have to keep doing, right?
5:53
That is where it becomes harder.
That is where most people can't go from step.
One to step two.
I mean, I guess there's a step 0 of like, you can't even show up places on time, because you're just that irresponsible, and sure those people don't have jobs, right?
Or can't hold a job and can't do basic work, right?
6:10
But once you can be basic, basically effective and go from like I can not show up.
Can show up on time and do a reasonable level of effort on something.
Now, you're at like level one, right?
Level two is that you learn how to work like and how to do repeatable tasks that are not mentally stimulating all the time so that you can achieve the desired outcome of what you have for a longer-term standpoint.
6:34
Then once you learn how to do hard work, you then learn how to become more efficient with your hard work, right?
You learn that, you work better at certain times and you can chunk your workout.
So that you can work those harde repeatable tasks in chunked out windows, because, you know that when you get interrupted your efficiency on, both tasks goes down.
6:55
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, And so it's like level 0, you don't know how to do anything level 1.
7:19
You can hear a basically you know, contributing member of society who can hold down a job level 2.
You can you understand how to work hard, right?
But you're like you can do it in spurts but you can't do consistently right.
Level 3, you know how to chunk your time and work efficiently so that you can have these bursts multiple times per day, so that you can get a lot more done, right?
7:44
Once you reach level 3, 3, there's no longer a more is better trade-off.
Alright, once you resolve through, there's no longer more is better trade-off.
What happens then is, you have to reverse the character traits that you had to build to get there and then start learning what you're going to stop doing because you now have the ability to work hard.
8:06
You understand how to chunk your time and and do concentrated efforts in bursts throughout the day so that you can maximize your time.
But then the question is, what are the things I am doing?
What dominoes am I choosing to push down and are there dominoes Some else could you do and what one of the two things, can I put all my bursted effort towards that will yield me, the greatest returns, right?
8:28
And so, if you see people Advance faster than you in life, it's because they have moved through these series of work faster than you have, right?
Or if you have employees who were less effective or more effective, it's usually because they don't know how to work.
They literally don't know.
And so, working is a skill.
8:45
Like, a lot of people talk about work ethic, like it's a character trait when I think that almost everything is.
Skills that are required, right?
Because then it's something that's under your control, right?
I mean it is and like the more you work, the better you get at working like that's easy to become Workaholics because they get really good at it, right?
9:04
And you get better over time but what you want to stay away from is being a workaholic rather than a result a holic right?
Or performance aholic of what's my output, right?
What's my throughput of what's actually getting pushed all the way through to the end zone, right?
9:20
And so look at your team and it might be, it might be helpful for you to be able to identify these things.
Like right now, your category one worker, you went from zero to being able to show up on time and breathe.
Congratulations.
It's important.
Some people can't do that.
So like you deserve to be act like, you know, praised for that.
9:39
But for you to actually stay here, you need to go from Level 1 to level 2 and understand that you need to be able to do things repeatedly that suck, right?
It's not all fun and games making calls.
This isn't fun, right?
Waking up and doing all of your sessions with a smile and energy is not fun.
9:56
Being there is easy being there with intensity and intention is not right.
That's the difference.
And so that's level.
Two level three is you learn how to chunk the time so you can do multiple works like that throughout the day.
So you get lots of things done and then level for is learning which of those things to do to maximize your Effectiveness.
10:16
So goes from efficiency to Effectiveness going from Level 3 to level 4 and Way more learning, what not to do, choosing what you're you're most interested in and excluding everything else from that.
So that you could knock the big dominoes down, they give you disproportionate are Outsiders Returns on your effort.
10:33
So anyways, I hope that was helpful for you.
I hope maybe you have a trainer or somebody on your staff, that's been on your mind and you're like, why does this person bother me?
It's probably because they think their level 3 worker when they're really a level one worker, and for you.
10:50
You can either get upset with them or you can give them the path of what they need to do to learn to work.
Right.
And a lot of times, I don't know if any of you have kids are you?
Well you've probably met a child before.
It's how about that?
Or met a teenager maybe you remember yourself as a teenager or someone in college for most of us who are on here, right?
11:10
Your most people watching this for business owners, you probably remember a moment where you learned the difference of effort of the work that you needed to do to succeed.
Right.
Like there's probably a moment where you realize that and I think for me, it was when I was in college, I ended up having to pledge a fraternity and what they made me do was I had to do three hours of studying everyday and I hadn't done that in ice.
11:38
Why did really well and Ice looks.
I just I got by.
I'm just being quick enough but in college I couldn't get away with that.
And so they forced me to be in a library for three hours a day because they wanted to make sure all their pledges got good grades.
They wouldn't get in trouble with the school, but when I actually had to work for three hours, like it was time, I need to be there for three hours and I had to work.
11:58
They wouldn't let you not work.
I was like, holy crap and I started learning.
I could get a hit on my work.
I could read chapters ahead.
I could take notes ahead.
I can look at the next assignment.
So we're coming up and get on top of things and after I stopped the whole pledging process, I realized how much time I had in my day because I only had to work three hours a day for pledging and I got the best grades at ever gotten at that point in college.
12:20
So then I realized I was like, oh my God, there's nothing other hours during the day that I wasn't doing anything with before I was, like, I'll bet you if I work 12 hours a day, I would be unstoppable at school and that was my Epiphany.
That was when I got out I was like, I'm literally going to work and work out and that is it like that's all I'm going to do, right?
12:39
Besides my social life, the started at night but from 99 everyone knew where I was either at the gym after the cafeteria at the library, that was it.
And so there's probably a moment that happened to you.
You that, you know, that was when I learned how to work that was when I went from a level 1 to level 2 worker, I learned how to batch my work and and and push through it, right?
13:01
And so you may need to tell your story to the person who you were talking to or create an environment for them to have that kind of aha moment where they learn what hard work looks like.
So anyways, I hope you guys have an amazing day.
Perfect Tuesday.
Thanks for all the love.
13:18

That Joey, Rico Krista have an amazing day, guys.
Hope you guys are doing fantastic lost.
Love.
All right.0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review if it was a post if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
Hello everyone.
Hope you're having an amazing lunch on this thing.
Fantastic Thursday.
I I have had this one on my mind for a super long time and hopefully it comes out in a series of pyramid thoughts but I was sharing the greatest lessons and failures that I have had as Jim Welch CEO since we have started and I thought I would share them with you because I showed that I shared these at the coaches Mastermind and I thought that you might want to know what they were.
0:55
So maybe you cannot make the same mistakes that I did and potentially have the less instead of having the experience.
Universal.
So, the first mistake, well, I've made many many, many mistakes, but I'll just do the last 12 months, and I think a lot of times when people talk about their mistakes, it's like it's really easy to talk about mistakes that have happened like two years ago because then you can be like, look, I've see didn't and and come past them.
1:17
But I'ma tell you ones that I've made like two months ago.
A month ago, right?
Right.
And so, starting a year ago, one of the first mistakes that I made as a step too far away from Jim launch and so I I step too far above.
This is a mistake that I see a lot of gym owners making our community.
1:33
So I hope all of these lessons are entrepreneur lessons that you can apply to your own business.
It just happens at different levels but it's the same state and the thing is, is a lot of these mistakes are dichotomies.
Their mistakes of going too far in One Direction, which is why it's like, should I be to just?
Or should I be too?
Merciful, it's good to have both but you have to walk the middle path and sometimes you have to walk one way more or the other, right?
1:55
In this instance, I was too far away and I now know with The Tell-Tale Kind of that is.
And so, this is how I can identify if I'm too far away, if I think that everything is going really well in a department, which for you, may just be your business in general or one component of your business.
2:13
Then I'm too far away, because there are always problems.
There are always mistakes.
There are always things that can be improved.
And if you don't know where all the holes are where all the skeletons are, all the bodies are buried, if you don't know where those are, then you're too far away.
2:29
And so that has become my litmus test for understanding, where I'm getting too far away in the business is if I don't know what's wrong with it, then it means I'm too far.
And so that's the first mistake that I've made.
I mean, that's for something about made many, many mistakes, just in terms of the first one, I want to talk about that mistake led to us over hiring in January.
2:52
And so, I actually, we got our team up to 130 people in January, and we currently have 85 We cut them for no reason that had to do with Revenue, we were still doing great.
We had our best month ever and I ended up realizing that all these people just didn't have anything to do.
3:10
Like I hired all these people but they actually weren't doing and so that kind of leads to the second problem or mistake that I made was, I expected coal traffic to ask the same way as warm traffic with regards to an offer.
3:26
So when we rolled out supplements, it was Massive success for the gym which Community we did like 1.7 million the first month.
It was awesome.
This can pretty much say it's pretty much stayed there, but what my expectation was that was not met with reality was that cold traffic because I was like, dude, there's no ads, there's no ad spend like you've literally run one, internal play and you just make a ton of money.
3:49
Like it's really that easy.
This will be the ultimate offer.
What I didn't realize is that there was two beliefs that needed to be broken out one and so whenever you sell a new offer, you always want the opportunity to have one.
Belief that needs to be broken.
Ideally you have a tractors and beliefs that need to be broken, right?
4:05
Ideally, you have multiple tractors and only one belief.
This one had only, this one had multiple tractors, but multiple leasing to be broken.
That was ultimately, the recent didn't work and the two beliefs were you should sell supplements, you should sell Prestige.
4:20
And that's what I didn't understand.
I thought there was only one belief that I needed a break which is that you should sell supplements.
And there was actually in fact to and so that's where everyone gets stuck up in cold traffic.
So people who didn't know she didn't trust us, who didn't know who dr.
Kashi was that, he worked for the Olympic Committee and like, all this stuff, right?
4:38
They didn't know that.
And so there were two beliefs that need to be broken out one.
And that is what prevented it from being a smashing coal, traffic offer.
And so, I hire a sales team.
I hired customer service team to fulfill what I believed was going to be the increase in demand, and it didn't happen.
4:55
And so what Adam happenings.
I had to cut all these people because they didn't have anything to do, right?
And that took a cultural hit, right on those departments, they've since recovered, and the people who are there, now, the absolute best people which in some ways is kind of break, is you don't know who are going to be the total a players, but if you hire 20 people, you know, from 20, who the top five are and then you end up getting sometimes better staff, and that was a, that was a side benefit, but I would definitely not have the cost of having to hire the many people and then letting them go because of Man.
5:26
So the next lesson I had was that you only hire when it hurts, right?
You want to wait until the capacity exceeds your current ability to utilize and a lot of times you have more utilization faster than you think you do, everyone thinks that they are overworked, right?
Every employee in general think that they work really hard, because that's who we are as humans, right?
5:44
Everyone thinks that they work really hard but most people can work more, right?
And so the thing is is that your work will expand given the amount of time you have when we had 20 people for customer service on.
Just the prestige laps Tech team.
They all said they were busy, we now have a staff of five doing the exact same work five, right?
6:04
Do the same work and based on the calculations we have we still have 30 or 40% capacity, right with that team.
And so like that was a lesson for me, only higher when it hurts.
Don't hire before damn it, right?
And my thought was, as I want to have an amazing experience for everyone who comes in, so we can anticipate it.
6:20
Be ahead and give it a like, like I said, give an amazing experience and that wasn't the case.
We didn't need to Hey guys, real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
6:35
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype for under million-dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads its hope free in exchange for email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller, All Leads and so that you can not miss Miss out on it because last time I sold out for like eight straight weeks really fast.
6:58
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
The next mistake that I made was what was the next mistake?
I made.
I think that The next mistake that I made was actually, I was listening to a small base of customers that wanted more things.
7:22
And so this is something that I'd say is something overall that I think that I made a mistake as that I'm that I'm currently actively trying to rectify but people want new things, right?
And so I want to give those people new things.
But as our customer Avatar has changed, a lot of people come in now, just want things that are want things to be better.
7:43
The Things rather than more additional things.
And so I made lots of like internal plays and we made lots of training Zone management.
Lots of trains on leadership all the things that people need it, right?
But People wanted things that were wanted fewer things that were deeper, if that makes sense.
8:03
And so that was one of the lessons that I have learned in going through this process, one of the other lessons that I have now learned is About hybrid actually.
So here's one of the mistakes that I made with hybrid.
I failed to articulate it, well, to my existing Community, right?
8:25
Of Jim words.
And so when I marketed an externally, like I'm a marketer.
Like I need to make it half Pizzazz, it needs to look new and different.
Right?
That's the point and and it's been super successful right from from from that standpoint.
But I had so many gym owners freak out and think that I wasn't going to help.
8:44
Homeowners, despite the name of the fucking group, being Jim Lord's, right?
My mistake, because I gave them a scenario where they wouldn't need to necessarily have the gym that they have but the other scenarios that you keep your gym, right?
But I didn't articulate that well enough and the term hybrid is something that I've read and you can see it all over the internet.
9:04
Now, everyone's talking about how to write because we branded it so well.
But the problem was, if I had just said, hey guys, we're going to add another level of service, and we're going to call it.
Accountability.
That's it.
No one would have freaked out.
It's fucking kind of Bill.
That's all.
9:19
That's right.
Just put a different wrapper on it but I did not communicate that well to my existing try.
And so what I look at the take rates from our coaching group, it's only like 25 percent of the gyms in the gym would Community have even tried to do that, right?
9:35
Have even decided to try and those guys have done really well on have a shitload of testimonies.
I'm excited to launch it.
But the thing is, is that I did, I failed.
To communicate that.
Well, and I failed to explain to our gym owner community that like I am here to help gyms the point of hybrid.
9:51
The point of adding additional level of service that doesn't cost you money and Equipment doesn't cost you square footage.
And just adds more profit is to make two Motors more money, which is the point.
The next mistake that I think that I made is by opening it up to trainers.
10:11
I think that some of the donors we have felt disenfranchised, Even though it's literally the exact same model I think, I could have maybe communicated that better.
And so, with each of these things that happen, I feel like it's just there, just lessons, you know what I mean?
Like, so, the lessons that I learned when I was too far away, is that if I don't see anything negative about apartment, I'm too far.
10:30
The lesson I learned when we over hired was that I you need a higher what hurts like you got to really stretch capacity before you hire more people, right.
And usually people always have more capacity than you think they do and even then they they do, right?
And always having a team of a players which was an inadvertent benefit of having that large influx.
10:51
And then cut that, we have the next lesson that I learned was around bolts on was that you have to have one single belief that needs to be broken in a sale.
Right?
One single belief that needs to be broken, when there are multiple beliefs, the sale becomes significantly harder and the likely that it's going to be a grand slam offer the super law.
11:13
And so I learned that right and I actually just did, I thought there was only one belief but the ended up that there had, there were actually two.
And then the next one was messaging around hybrid.
If I had just said, hey guys, we're launching this new program.
All it is is an additional level of service on top of what you already do at your gym and we're calling it accountability, right?
11:33
So we're going to call it accountability and you're going to get a 30 or people paid extra dollars a month and you'll be able to or three extra profit, right?
If I just said that, I probably would had a way higher, take great internally.
And if I could have done it again, I would have released it that way and then said, hey guys, by the way, I'm going to call this hybrid.
11:50
So it sounds sexier but I'm not changing, still just accountability but I'm going to call it hybrid externally so that people get excited about, okay?
And that's what I would have done.
But these are, these are the mistakes that we make your.
I mean, there were, there were some gyms or who'd left.
We're like, we don't think Alex was to help Jim's anymore.
12:09
I don't know what I would need to do to someone.
Now look I'm not going to start like literally all I do is I'll Jim's, you know what I mean?
And like the lastly generalist was driving people into a gym, like it's all we do.
But the thing is, is when someone has that there's always truth.
12:24
You don't mean I could point fingers and be like how could you think that?
But it's like there's always going to be a mistake that I made and so I guess you know, the biggest lessons that I've learned from all of those things is that like you're always going to fuck up.
You know what I mean?
And the thing is, is that like, especially Have decisions to make.
You don't know what the right answer is and you never will know what would have happened if you had done it the other way and that's just part of the game, you know?
12:49
And so I share that with you because maybe you are too far away maybe you over higher.
Maybe when you articulated a change to your community, you could have like, we as not hers, love change, but I have realized now that humans hate change.
13:07
No matter how well I said.
L it ever in fucking hates change.
I maybe we on this.
Call are weirdos wheel of change.
We thrive in chaos, right?
I love the excitement of something new, but most people, your employees, your clients don't like change.
13:25
In fact, they hate change and so articulating change.
I think I could I could have been less.
Don't be an idiot.
Here's the fax follow the math, I could have been less around that.
I'm a little bit more empathetic with my communication.
13:41
So anyways we have some sick-ass stuff coming out next Friday.
I'm so pumped.
We have some really cool like the next to release calls are going to be fucking epic.
I'm so pumped.
I've been like waiting for a lot of these things but I always have an amazing day guys.
13:58
I hope this would be fun value in this in some way and maybe you, maybe you have one of these things that you have made.
Think about.
But anyways, thank you to all the hybrid Crushers.
I have seven should assist emotivism excited to launch.
For those of you who have been implementing it and it's have an amazing day.
14:17
Guys, keeping awesome.
I'll catch you guys soon.
Think about.
But anyways, thank you to all the hybrid Crushers.
I have seven should assist emotivism excited to launch.
For those of you who have been implementing it and it's have an amazing day.
Guys, keeping awesome.
I'll catch you guys soon.









0:00
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show morning everyone, happy Sunday.
0:20
I haven't talked about sales in a long time and sales is probably one of my favorite topics and it's one of the things that we were most known for at least.
Outside of this space.
And so I feel like I might get back to my roots, the next couple podcast, such videos.
0:37
And so I wanted to tell you a quick story about the gasp and so when you are training a new salesperson or even you know, one of your existing trainer to sell, one of the difficulties is selling higher ticket and that's because people sell out of their own wallet meaning.
0:54
If they believe that something costs a lot of money to them then they will be less likely to be able to Tell it to someone else because they think I could never afford this, I would never pay for this.
And therefore, this person won't make that, you know, they won't buy.
There's a couple of issues with that.
The first is that, and this is what you have to explain to an incoming sales person, or a sales person who is struggling is that we understand certain things that someone who's coming in does not.
1:19
And so, for example, a mechanic might be like, gosh, I could never like I can't believe I'm going to sell this guy like radiator and whatever and like an oil change from like I like, it takes two seconds.
Do we have trench knowledge that other people don't know that comes naturally to us because we've been doing this for such a long time and we and we underestimate how valuable the things that we understand art or people who do not know them, right?
1:44
Like I am useless at virtually everything that has to do with like fixing things and and household, chores and cars.
And like I'm useless at most of those things and so if someone were to come and sell me on something like I have no idea.
I just want them to take care.
2:00
Right?
And so if that person was like, you know, you can probably take care of this and you can probably take care of that they're down selling me on things that like I want.
I'm like no like I don't want that and so often I see this in Fitness sales as well with people who are inexperienced right and so I want to show you tell you this one story.
2:19
I got from Nick Eliot who's a phenomenal sales person.
He runs a 35 percent sales for Italy boss and phone sales.
Just selling cold people who opted into two thousand dollar packages.
Are they did An opt-in for a program, they literally call them up and sell them like real sales.
Okay.
2:34
And one of the one of the stories that he tells us about his time when he was at six pack shortcuts and what they would tell new people coming in, is that when you pitch the initial offer, the first thing that you're going to tell someone, right?
That is your pricing, correct.
You have to rip the Band-Aid off of How High this is going to go.
2:53
They would tell their new prospects in their new recruits.
If the person doesn't gasp on the phone at the price.
You did not go high enough.
I'll say it again.
They would tell the new people coming in the door.
When you pitch it pitch, the biggest package we have and go as hard and as long as you can in terms of length and duration and paid in full and you want that sticker to have a shock, you want the prospect on the other side of the phone to gasp, right?
3:21
And they would tell them them and so when people who were new came in it removed the fear of the shock because they made the shock, the Objective, it was fucking brilliant.
And so I am telling you, if you make that the objective, what happens is that you push the price barrier, right?
3:40
When you get someone to have shock and then their pricing is massively stretched from when their expectation.
All of a sudden you break into a new Stratosphere of bun in retail, if you're going to go buy a suit, right?
I did this recently actually not that recently, two years ago.
3:57
I went into a really high-end suit place right now.
It's like, I'm going to get a really sweet suit.
Like I said, I've never had one.
I really want.
And so, I went there and the first suit they had me try on looked great and there.
And then, I was like, well, how much is this thing?
And they're like, the jacket is 12,000, right?
4:13
And so they started me there, right?
And I was like, listen to him.
There's like no fucking stood in the world is worth that to me.
Like, I don't care as long as it's tailored.
Right, I'm good, right?
And so they then went to the next suit.
They try to copy, right track.
Other suits on and they were like this one I think is going to be really great for you.
4:30
So I tried on in the whole suit was like three or four brain or something like the whole thing.
Right.
And at that point I had been pricing heard at 12 and I literally felt like it was a good deal walking out for like thirty eight hundred bucks.
I was like great and only after the experience, I was like, man, I was like they rock that like he totally crushed me.
4:51
And what happened is after?
I started there that was the first purchase of the day.
I hired It seemed like professional shopper Russell, told me to do it, and it was actually a pretty good idea.
I've ended up getting some clothing, but anyways, from there, we went to like, you know, some places in the mall and got like some shoes to match and all that kind of shit, right?
5:12
But what happened is that after that first twelve thousand dollar price, point, anchor, everything else felt like a rounding error really like everything else felt like nothing and I think I spent total of like ten thousand dollars in the day between Layla and I going to like some of Nice to shops and Hugo Boss, and getting nice belts, all the sort of stuff, right to like redo, but it was all because that initial barrier was broken at the beginning of the day, right?
5:36
And then everything else is nothing.
And so to the same degree in Fitness, if you can make that big sale or at least get the gasp, go for the gasp upfront, then everything after that will seem significantly less expensive and you'll be able to collect more money up front.
5:52
You'll be able to get the person more invested and you'll ultimately be able to close more people at a higher.
ER, average price Hey, Moe is an Asian quick break, just to let you know.
We've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright so send me a connection request.
A note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
6:10
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or Layla's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
So the second piece to, this is a belief that you have to embed inside of your sales people or yourself.
6:27
That the more someone pays, the more, they pay attention.
You may have heard me say this before but it's super true.
If someone pays $21 to do something, they don't give a shit.
Right.
If someone pays twenty one hundred dollars to do something, they will probably care a lot more.
And so it is in our best interest and their best drink just for us to sell them at the highest possible personal investment.
6:49
Okay?
Don't think.
What is the price thing?
Think how much can I get this person to invest in themselves?
All right, so want you to take that as a pre frame, when you're talking to these people, when you walk in the door, you have to think, how can I get this person to invest the maximal amount of money in themselves?
7:06
And when you think that way you're thinking about it from the context of helping this person, right?
You're not like I need to close the sale because that never comes from the right angle.
Your energy will be off.
Your tonality will be off and what happens is when you get into an obstacle over Um, situation, you will start talking a combative tone, how, like, how could, you know, what do you have to think about?
7:26
Like, you start getting into that and you never win there.
If you're always selling from your back foot, with the intention of helping, the person make the investment in themselves and overcome, the fears of making the decision that most people have, then you will be able to win, right?
And you also may be able to help that person.
7:43
And so that's the angle that you have to come out when you're making these sales.
That being said, when someone walks in your door, Whether it's for a 21-day promotion, a six-week challenge, a 12-week trick.
It doesn't matter what they walk in the door for you can sell them to their goal, you do not need to sell these specific program that they came in.
8:04
For that program, may not be the solution to their problem.
In all likelihood, it isn't the solution to their problem because it's a short, duration thing.
When in fact, they probably want a bigger solution.
So, if you identify, when someone walks in the door, what their goal is over, the Long-term, you can sell to that goal rapid guarantee around it, make an irresistible offer, give them a same-day discount for making your pain.
8:30
Full for that duration of time in the beginning, and you may be able to get one, two out of five to take their thing that they came in for which is maybe a six hundred dollar front end program and actually upsell them to a two thousand three thousand dollar ticket, all right?
8:46
And if you come at it from that angle and you treat everyone the same when they walk in the door and you are equal.
To your salesperson.
You will also sell more people because when you actually sell them at the price point, which just by the way, in general, a six hundred dollar price point for impulse buy is typically the one that you can get everyone on but but you're underselling 20% of people who are saying yes, twenty to thirty percent, could go two to three times that price and so if you want to maximally extract the value from the people who are walking in the door, you need to match goal to the promotion to the prospect of the price that that person can for right in the I'm an investment that they're going to make.
9:22
I can tell you that a very rich person won't care about $600, right?
And so if you were trying to best serve them, then you need to make the investment.
An investment that is significant enough that they will care about the investment so that they will invest in themselves.
And when you're going through the sales process, you're seeing where that point is, for that person so that you can find the maximum investment Point.
9:42
Don't be afraid of having the person say no to the big one.
That's okay.
You ripped off the Band-Aid, you price position well and then you can down so to what their large sum.
Is that they're able to do for themselves, all right and when you do it this way, you can chew or 3x, the average front end ticket that you can have.
9:58
And so when you're teaching your salespeople, the to beliefs that you need to convince that love is one that when they present the price they should go for the gasp.
If they didn't get the gasp then they didn't go high enough.
All right.
Which means that if you're saying I'm selling you at $99 week for 33 weeks because that's how long it's going to take us to get there.
10:17
Then you're saying, 3,300 dollars up front is what you were going for.
For if they do not gasp you should have gone higher.
Does that make sense?
After that?
You have the you have the, you have to give them the conviction that this is helping this person invest more in themselves which will ultimately yield the best result for them in the long term, right?
10:35
We can all agree in.
This is part of that sale that the reason they came in if they're trying to lose 50 pounds, it's not going to happen in six weeks.
Unless we start lopping off body parts, right?
It's not going to happen, they know it, you know it.
So just solve their problem.
If someone then is like, I really can't afford it by blah blah blah.
10:50
Sure, shorten the duration of time with the coming in for and then you can also really down.
So the thing that they walked in the door for but with the understanding that you're still going to have the intention of solving the initial problem when they walk in.
And so I'm going to talk more about sales because I love sales but I haven't made one in a while if you like this comment and like it so that I know and I'll make more stuff like this but teaching the gasp and transferring the conviction that the more the higher, the investment, the individual makes in money, the more invested they will be and ultimately the more Successful.
11:21
They will likely have in terms of outcomes.
And if you can extend it over a period of time, you know, and I know that in 33 weeks in 36 weeks, we can genuinely change someone's life in six weeks.
In 8 weeks really fucking hard, right?
It's really hard to change someone's life in that period of time, but if you can get the commitment then you can massively impact this person and so that should be your belief going into it.
11:43
And that should be the belief that you convict your salespeople with so that they don't sell from their own wallet and they sell out of the wallet of the You're so that they can get the investment.
That is, that is Meaningful for that person and they don't let their own experience or their own knowledge.
Devalue, what you are, providing the person who's walking in the door.
12:00
So I hope that makes sense.
I've got was available for you.
In terms of breaking somebody's for your sales, people go for the gas transfer the conviction and then don't let them self from their own wallet.
You also be able to help more people and make way more money on the front end.
All right, have an amazing day guys.
Happy Sunday, I'm going to be digging super deep into our sales scripts and process.
12:19
I'm remaking a whole sales training and making really short in the deleting everything else into one Central sale.
So I'm pretty pumped and going through all my lifetime notes which is great.
So have an amazing day and I love couple like intact.
All right. whole sales training and making really short in the deleting everything else into one Central sale.
So I'm pretty pumped and going through all my lifetime notes which is great.
So have an amazing day and I love couple like intact.
All right.









0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually a pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
Happy Wednesday everybody.
Hope you guys are having a halfway awesome week or an amazing week but halfway through it.
So I was having a conversation with a dream owner OG gym, owner of ours, and he was saying that That he was struggling with some people problems.
0:33
And so I I've been putting some things, some thoughts together about people stuff in general and I thought this would be a great one to address.
And so how to never have a trainer still your clients.
So after you learn how to Market and sell the next bottleneck in your business is going to be your services, the thing that you are fulfilling.
0:55
And if you're doing a brick-and-mortar service business with just about everyone on here is the Is someone else, right?
Whereas, if you were selling Widgets or selling retail selling things Goods, whatever or something software, then you are selling a widget which is unchanged for, you know, for the large part and not really dependent on someone else, right?
1:17
Whereas service your training, someone to deliver a service and then you have given them the skill that they can now leave with because it's inside of them, right?
And then start doing that somewhere else on their own.
And so this is This is kind of the cost in the benefit of running a service business is that they're extremely easy to start?
1:34
There's a little barriers to entry, there are more difficult to scale and so this is kind of the Seesaw that goes into scaling, a business, especially service-based business.
And so, one of the things that I consistently see is everyone.
1:50
Consistently always wants to talk about acquisition and don't get me wrong.
That's exactly what I'm going to give because that's what everyone wants to talk about, but the wiser business owners will understand that.
Once you have acquired enough customers, the problem with your business is not acquisition, the problem is because you don't know how to service these people.
2:06
And you don't know how to scale a service business because the big secret is that people will always be your problem.
Say it again, people will always be your problem because the skillset around managing people consistently gets harder and harder, the more people you have, and in order to scale a business, any business you have people even if you're scaling software, even if you're scaling a retail product or good, you're still going to have people.
2:33
Now in those instances, it's just a ratio of how much revenue you can generate per employee, right.
And so that you know like a software business can usually generate more For employee, but no matter what, any of those business you have to scale people and that is why operations is the least sexy thing in the world.
2:49
But also the thing that is probably the bottleneck to getting you to where you want to go.
And so when I give you is kind of three things of why someone is not going to do what they're what they're doing or what you want them to do and then a three-fold model to get them to do what you want them to do.
3:05
And then hopefully I'll end off with the with the prompt of how to never have trainers to your clients again.
So I Actually reading this book, which is considered one of the best operations books of all time address Grove.
He's the one who was CEO of Intel.
It's amazing book.
You should definitely read it.
3:21
He's phenomenal.
He turned around and tell when Japan came in and undercut like he's amazing.
Anyways he said it's really simple.
There's only he said there's only two things and I'm adding one more even though he's probably smarter than me.
But he said there's only two reasons that someone is not going to do what you want them to do.
3:37
It's either because they don't know how they don't want to that's it.
And so your job is to Train and to motivate and that is all the only piece that I would add at the third piece is that someone doesn't know what you want them to do, which would be communication, right?
Because some people might have the skill and might want to do it, they just you're not communicating well and so they don't even know what you want.
3:58
Which happens far more often than you think way more often than you would take.
And so those are what I would say.
The three main reasons.
But based on the if you are assuming you're very clear on what you want that person to do and you don't think there's any way that they would not understand what you want them to do.
Neither don't know how to do it or they don't want to do it.
4:15
And so when you understand that, those are the fundamental shoes that is it is really that simple.
Then it's like okay then what are the action steps that we have to do in order to get someone to want to do it Beyond training?
So I'm going to assume that you're training.
Your staff on a regular basis.
That is why having one-on-one with your team or really important, that is why having group meetings with your team is important.
4:34
That is why having leadership trainings, having skill-based range with your team is important because you are selling their ability to service clients.
And so, would you not want your Oh, Ducks, if you consider your staff, if you're selling service to be a products to become more valuable.
But now that also feeds into the threefold model of keeping people.
4:52
Now, I've heard this first from Peter Parks marketer guy.
He's huge in the affiliate world but he had a three-fold model that you probably heard from somewhere else.
But anyways, it was really good and it's simply incentivize motivate Inspire and you incentivize with money, you motivate with opportunity.
5:12
And you inspire with recognition.
And so if you're if you're unpacking this and you're thinking about, how do I, how do I keep people, right?
You keep people with those three things, the incentive around money, the opportunity to grow, and the inspiration that once they've achieved something, you recognize them publicly.
And so if you think about it, this is kind of before during and after right you get them to come on board with the incentive of money.
5:33
You get them to reach for the opportunity when they see the future.
And once they've achieved what you want them to achieve you recognize them for Know which crazy about simple things is that they are the hard ones to do because they're so simple.
That you think there's something more complex, but the reality is that it is the boring shit that no one wants to do.
5:51
And that is why most people don't do it right, but it is the key, right?
And so, how to never have a trainer steal, your clients comes down to the ugly shit, that no one wants to talk about, which is your culture, and that is an Affliction of you of you of it as a business owner of how willing you are to sacrifice for your team, how how much they know that you are investing in.
6:11
In them, right?
How much opportunity?
And how much Vision you are?
Projecting.
If for those of you who, unfortunately, you guys aren't on the inside of our company, but what happens is, every, every gym owner, that we've had, who's come on as a coach or like really, it's mostly just the coaches.
And they've actually seen how we run the company on the inside there.
6:29
Like, this was almost more valuable than anything I could have gotten from you, to actually see you implementing all these things you tell us to do.
And so they see me every month going over the vision of the company.
What we're trying to accomplish who were trying Help how we're going to do it and what the plan Ford looks like, right?
And they see that every single month, they see every single month.
6:47
We talked about our values, what we stand for, who exemplify these values, our Employee of the Month, like, we have all of these things and we do them every month, right?
And on the weekly meetings, when ours, for ours is Department because we have too many people to do bigger ones, but inside of there, it's like, here's here's where we're going.
7:04
Here's the opportunity, right?
Here's the, like, recognition of who did an awesome job and so each department also says, like here's Our star of last week or last month based on x y z.
You know, Chelsea totally crush this build out for all the gym owners and she did it in like two days and she worked overtime and she crushed it, right?
7:23
These are the things that people live for, you know what I mean?
Like, no one.
Like most people, most humans think they want more money.
But the emotional increase that you get from having more money last, like, 14 days.
And after that, you don't feel it anymore, most Nation real quick, if you are A business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
7:46
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
And so, knowing that being smart individuals, as you are, who are listening to this, you can keep your profit the same.
8:08
You can keep your profit Higher by giving them.
The other things that people want.
The money is really there to to attract the right people because people have bear, you know, they have bars of what they're what they're willing to come in for right.
But after that, everything is going to be about the opportunity.
8:24
The future of how they're going to grow and the recognition that you give them for for accomplishing.
What you need.
Um to accomplish.
And if they are not accomplishing what you want them to accomplish, then you have to look at how am I motivating them?
How am I training?
Right, and how am I communicating to make sure that they know exactly what I want them to do?
8:42
And so if you look at that and you look at the team that you have and you're like, am I communicating in a way that they understand?
That they are duplicating, what I'm trying to say they understand fantastic.
Then there's only two things that are left to either don't know how to do it or they're not motivated to do it and then you have to figure out once they are trained then.
8:59
Not motivated.
And once you were there, then it becomes very clear of is this the right person or is this the wrong person for the team and then if they are the wrong person, get them out because there's nothing more demotivating for a team of a players than someone who isn't.
9:14
And one of the things I asked that our coaches Mastermind is if anyone on here has ever been on a winning team, right?
Many many of us.
I mean, we're mostly Fitness people who are listening to this.
Most of us played Sports at some time in our life, right?
And hopefully On multiple teams, if you played on a winning team with a great coach, you know, how different it felt how you practice, how you showed up to games, how prepared you were, right?
9:41
How you how you treated, everything, the details, how you set up your bag?
You like everything, like there was a process, there was a system, there was an expectation and there was a bar that was set by the coach and that was the culture of the team in your company.
Right now, you are a team and you are the coach.
9:59
Ouch.
And if your company does not feel like the winning team that you remember when you were playing ball, That is your fault.
You are the shitty coach.
And so those players are going to leave and go on their own.
10:15
Sit, it's orders.
And so if you're able to think about your company as a team and think about what it felt like to be on a team that wins right to be on a team that sets the bar high that expects more people, people play sports for free.
In fact, people pay to play sports so you can see that money is not the primary motivator.
10:35
People are there for recognition and because they feel like they have an opportunity to grow, right?
Most people aren't going to go play pro and a lot of people don't even have that feeling.
Thing that's going to happen.
And so understanding that, and I think that if you can put that lens in your eyes are like, how am I running my team, right?
10:53
How am I running my team?
When you had practice, how many times a week did you practice, right?
The more you practice the better, you got your practice are going to be the meetings, your skill development.
There's the one on ones that you're having these are the basics.
These are the things you have to do, and if you're not doing them, your company is not going to grow, right?
11:09
And then you're going to wonder when you check out because you have a modicum of success, you have a certain hour. - success that you deem does now I'm successful.
You check out you forgot, two things that got you there and then what happens your company slowly unwinds, right?
11:25
And then all of a sudden, you get, you get surprised when someone leaves with 70 clients, right?
But the indicators of that were from three or four months, prior, when you stopped giving a shit where they felt like, you stopped giving a shit.
And so, you have to paint the future of where the opportunities for them.
11:41
You have to train them.
You have to invest in them so that they feel like they are continuing to grow With you and you have to recognize them when they do the things that they're supposed to do and you have to do it regularly because people, forget people need to need to bathe daily.
They need to be motivated daily, right?
And so if you have Huddle's, like if like on our models that we have every morning we're like where the winds and so everyone just gets on and says they're wins.
12:02
It's a great way to start the date sets, the tone that like we're winning team we move forward and by no means is Jim not perfect.
There's many things that we could do better, but I'm just saying, if you have that much intention behind it, your team will grow and will be better.
Right and ultimately if you were sick scaling service, you're scaling people you were scaling people playing on a team together.
12:22
And so like scaling Services a lot like sports.
And so if you can take that mindset and you can apply it to your business, you will be one among among the winners because as soon as you know how to Market and sell, you will realize that that is no longer the bottleneck in your business and the bottleneck is you and that's what a lot of people don't want to face.
12:41
I don't mark it that because no one wants to admit on an ad that they suck, right?
I'm like yeah you need more clients.
That's what it is.
Any more clients you need hybrid.
You need a new way of running your business, right?
I'll mark it that because that's what people want to hear but the reality is they just don't know how to fucking service your clients, right?
12:57
You don't know how to more importantly serves your team who is then servicing your clients for you.
So anyways I hope that makes sense.
I hope you have an amazing landscape that was valuable if you did like this, I know this wasn't sales-oriented but please drop a comment, drop a tag jumbo.
Like if you feel like that if you're actually looking at podcast, if you can drop a review that be sweet to.
13:14
I've never I don't think I've You're one of those.
So if you could leave a review, that would be fantastic.
Otherwise, I'm having Mason, you guys.
I hope you guys keep crushing life and talk to you soon.
All right.
Back.0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else and everyone, happy Tuesday, hope You have had an amazing start to your week.
So due to the response that I got from last sales-oriented podcasts video that I made, I wanted to fog that.
0:43
Since you guys were like, hey we want more of that.
So like for I'll talk about cells.
And so what I want to do is basically break down the first thing that I see is a mistake.
When people are trying to sell Fitness, really what they're trying to sell anything and just to take a quick back step when we went our His major Cole who turned around 13. 24 Hour Fitness has.
1:02
So all he did was turn around Fitness sales teams.
All right, that's literally all he did.
And so before he started working with us and when he goes in, to give feedback to salespeople, all he does is follow the closer framework that we have in the book.
And he says, let me see where you clarified, where why they came in?
1:18
Let me see where you label the pain, let me see where you overview past experiences.
And so, like, there is no rocket science.
The only thing that you do when you scale is do more of the things that you did when you were one-on-one, right in your just do them on larger.
ER, on a larger scale, right?
You have systems in place to make sure that you're doing that so clarification, right, why, what are the objectives of this part of the sale?
1:39
And so when someone walks in the door, they are coming in taking all of the stuff they have from their, their husband, and their texts.
And there, you know, on the way here and traffic in the personal parking lot, whatever it is right there, bringing that into the door.
And so our goal everything before the sale and then up to that first point is to get them in the right State of Mind to be likely to buy.
2:00
So the way that we do that in the pre-sale, maybe I should probably do a separate video on the pre-sale.
You know, screw it.
I'll just make this video about the pre-sale.
So when that person walks in the door of the selling environment that you have set up is incredibly important because it can position the prospect to be more likely to buy.
Right?
And so when they walk in the first thing they should see are tons of testimonials floor-to-ceiling.
2:20
They should see tons of frame 5 Star reviews from your Yelp or Google or Facebook reviews, take screenshots of them print them out, put them on the wall if you walked in and just saw Walls of five-star reviews and then walls of before and afters, you probably be like immediately before anyone says, he's hit anything.
Wow.
2:35
These guys really care about results.
They really know what they're doing, right?
It's before any words, have been spoken because the sales started in the parking lot, the sales started when you set the appointment, right?
And so we're just walking through this process.
So now when they walk in the door they need to be greeted with in 10 seconds.
And that means.
And what's really great about this is that if someone's far away from the door and they Sprint over to say hello and greet them, it's even better because they're like, wow, these people really care and you're automatically.
3:00
That impression sitting that bar of how excellent you are, providing service one that person greets them.
If they were not, the person who's going to be selling them, they should all know that I need to sit you down and give you this pre-sell questionnaire for why do we do a pre-sale questionnaire?
Because we're going to remind them of the things of the reasons that they came in of the reasons of why it's important in the reasons of that.
3:20
They said like that they even walked in that day, right?
And so the whole point is to agitate is to identify the pain and then agitate that pain and what we're doing.
Is we're extending the amount of time that they're sitting in the pain and the reason that they walked in that day, right?
3:37
And so and if you like the details around, what makes this powerful is that if you are special like whether you the person is doing the sale, you're not doing persons during the sale, you should.
If you can walk them through the Sheep, read the questions to them, clarify it to them.
And if you can squat down to eye level, if you've ever had a waiter do this, or a waitress, when you squat down to eye level, people feel like you're leveling with them and your inconvenience.
4:00
Yourself to service them and so they're like wow, these people really care.
So imagine this person who walks in the door.
Sees all the testimonials.
See all the five star reviews someone walks over says.
Hi.
You're like you know, like hey I see that you're like if they know if they if the schedule is visible, like millio are you sharing or never?
4:16
It's like or hey, what's your name?
Are you here for what?
I like, how can I, you know, how can I help you?
Whatever it is and so they greet them within 10 seconds or say, hey, I think so something with Shawn, you're like, yes, he's will be right with you or you know what sharks were busy.
I can take you and I promise I'm twice as as good as Sean, right?
Hahaha great whatever.
4:32
And then you can transition the process, sit them down with the pre-sale questionnaire form.
You make some comments about the testimonials.
If you have a testimonial book, you can also give that to them while they wait.
If that person is not the person who's doing the sale and then you walk them through the pre-sale questionnaire, right?
Which is going to be like why did you come in today?
4:50
What is your primary goal?
Like what have you done in the past?
What do you think has been missing right?
All we're doing is taking you through the sale before we actually sell them again.
And the reason you do that is that when you Have a systematic process, you are more likely to have a consistent result, which means when you have consistent results, you have a scalable solution.
5:07
And also means that you're stacking, the chips are so the deck in the favor of poorer sales.
People people who are not as good as you are, you are the proprietor, you will always be better, or you should always be better at selling your own stuff that anyone elses, right?
Because you should be more convicted about it.
You also have the most to gain, right?
5:25
Hey guys.
Real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I've a book on Amazon Called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand, five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over 1,000 hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
5:41
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I push the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
So you probably don't want to sell the rest of your life.
5:58
Maybe, maybe you do.
I get it because I was awesome but like, on some level you probably do want to supplement your life.
And so what you have to do is how can I make it as easy as possible for someone who is not as good as me to sell?
And these are the steps that you put in the process like, when Layla, I used to saw we would sell out of a warehouse for the card table.
6:17
We're really good at sales.
We've done this a long time, right?
And so, we have people come in, there's no equipment.
It's literally an empty Warehouse with the car table and we're like, yeah, it's $600 there.
Like you guys, do you have a gym?
Like yeah, Jimmy results.
Like it'll be, it'll be great in three weeks.
6:33
Don't even worry about it.
Like we've done this many times, they're like, okay, so like if you are good enough you don't need any of this stuff.
But the point is that the more of this stuff you have, the more you can not be on a good day, you cannot have a lot of energy, the more you cannot have built, Rapport the fast, you can close the sale because you have all these things that have already carried the ball.
6:53
Halfway down the field, three-quarters the way down the field and then all you're trying to do is just push it over the end zone.
And so that's the idea if you have, you know, if you've got what is it?
Reggie Bush.
Okay, with a good anyways what is if you have a stud you know we can just run down the field no matter what, it doesn't matter.
7:10
But the more you can do that then more consistent, the process will be in the more likely.
You are to close a sale and at a higher price.
Ice.
So, if you don't have a pre selling Process that is set up at your gym and your trainers.
Do you not understand what is supposed to happen when someone walks in the door?
7:27
Right?
And your sales person doesn't consistently go out.
Give like greet them within 10 seconds.
Like give them the priesthood questionnaire, walk them through it if possible unless they're with a prospect, right?
And if they are with a prospect, see if someone else can do it, if they can't, then they're going to have to go through it themselves.
7:43
Then you have that, you also have the pre-sale questionnaire so that you can have some ammunition.
That's already been taken care of what bad habits, do you have?
How much do you spend per week on those bad habits, right?
And now all of a sudden we were like, well, they said, they can't afford it.
It's like, do they already said?
They got $600 a month and bad in bat shit that you can be able to cut out all these little things.
8:00
They just, if you close an extra 10%, 20% of people, walk in the door, it's a massive increase in the amount of sales that your gym is going to be able to make and it takes an afternoon or two of training and one afternoon of putting up all the pictures going to Kinko's to set this up at your gym.
8:18
All right, I talked about this.
Endless detail in the book if you want you can grab it.
Alex book.com.
I make my eight, my nine dollars on the book.
It cost me more to send you the book, but if you want there's details on how to sell this stuff out.
But I hope that just gives you an overt like big picture, how to clarify, how to how to increase the like that, someone is going to buy when they walk in your facility so that you can extract the most value.
8:40
Deliver the most value, give it an amazing experience and even if for some reason that person does not buy they have nothing but nice things to say about how Professional Service was.
All right to have an amazing day guys.
Happy Day.
Terrific, Tuesday, turnout Tuesday, tactical Tuesday and I'll catch you guys on.









0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect, and let's rock and roll.
0:17
Hello everyone and welcome to the gym.
Sugars podcast.
This is Alex, I will be your host and we will be talking about Customer service and fulfillment which is everyone's favorite topic.
What I want to talk about some little bit different and this was a thought process that I kind of came to me when I read 10 x which is great grandparents book, gosh a year or two ago and it was like what would you need to?
0:41
What kind of service would you need to deliver?
If you were to 10x your prices right now, sometimes 10x is a little bit much, but let's just say, maybe more reliably for extra prices, right?
Like what would you do, what would you need to deliver in order to feel justified in that?
And then like let your brain go wild like, man they'd have personalized, you know, grocery list, we check in with them every week.
1:03
You know?
Like we would, we'd have a monthly grocery trip.
We actually shot with them at the grocery store.
They would have someone online that, that would answer their questions at any time of day, we would make sure that we met with them in person.
At least 15 minutes once a week, just to talk to them about the gold, whatever it is, right like all that all those things, right?
1:22
Look at that list and then see which ones are low cost, which ones are things that you can actually Implement.
And a lot of times, there's a ton of things that, you know, you can Implement that don't cost a lot of money that you just don't do.
And the reality is that a lot of times people lose a ton of their business.
Like the biggest problem, most a small business that we, that we do with, especially obviously gyms, because that's what we specialize in is that they have so many holes in their bucket.
1:42
They're so focused on Legion because they're drowning because they just, they just not keep anyone.
And it's because their level of service is just not that good.
It's not that you're bad, okay?
So I'm not, I'm not saying that like is every most people are like listen argent's different.
We're a family.
We listen.
Just so, you know, every single time that I ever talked to you since that.
1:58
So that doesn't make you different makes you the same.
But what does make you different is if you have consistently amazing, customer service, okay?
So that's the one that I love taking because I think that if you communicate that to your team, you communicate that to your customers, your customers police your team because that's what you set, the standard as And you start breeding a culture of amazing customer service that in and of itself can start like you can start increasing your prices a b and you will retain people, see, you'll get more referrals, it's nuts.
2:26
It's crazy.
What actually happens when you try and go above and beyond for your customers rather than thinking, well, they only pay me X.
So they only get this right and and it kind of flips the whole equation from resenting people.
A lot of times with a lot of the Jammers, I talk to, you know, they got in business because they love helping people and then as time goes on, they make they are just not making the income.
2:45
They want to.
They Work 80 hours a week and I like, dude I'm like I'm so tired of this, right?
And so I know it's hard when you're in that spot but it's like you gotta try, you got like, you have to just dig real deep and it's if you just love and you fall in love with your customers and you figure out a way.
And like I said, a good exercise is taking that to the next principle and then seeing what else you could possibly do, right?
3:06
Possibly.
And a lot of these things aren't cost.
I could you write them a handwritten card every week doesn't cost you time, right?
I really probably doesn't write it maybe once a month, whatever it is.
Okay.
Like if you to write 200 cards a month and 50 cards a week, right?
It's like 10:00 today.
You can do that in 20 minutes every morning and I guarantee that those 20 minutes will be well, worth far more than you Netflix thing, or like hanging out on Facebook and liking someone's comment, right?
3:29
Like, those types of actions are things that people talk about.
Those are the type of service experiences that people go through there.
Like to these people are being a Cardinals, just City, appreciate me, right?
They've given me a personal letter about how like how I did a great job at that at that I mean leg workout yesterday, right?
Like that's the kind of thing that people tell their Friends about and then when their friends are that they're like I want to check out that place, they're doing something different.
3:51
All right, they're giving a crap about their customers and they're going above and beyond, not in above and beyond way where people are.
Like, I have a family at my gym, like we really care about it.
Like I get that.
I understand it.
Everyone says that.
So what are you really doing this tactically different?
And that's going to push you a buck, and most times you can get there just by working a little harder, just by doing things that people are other.
4:10
People aren't willing to do and by organizing your time because most people are wasting, and most business owners are talk to our lead to scattered.
Bring the script in there, trying to start a side business of food prep, to trying to start an online training business, on top of running the gym, and they're doing that because they're not making money in their gym.
When in fact, they're just shooting themselves in the foot because they're spreading their attention rather than saying, how can I absolutely amazed these customers like what would I want my parents to go through my grandparents, to go through like what what process would I be proud of that?
4:36
Could put my name on be like, that is an onboarding process.
As soon as someone signs up with me, they're going to get a swag bag.
They're gonna get ahead, written car.
You're going to get an email and a voicemail all from me.
Within the first four days after that they're getting a second hand written card, just to ask them.
Hey, we love you and we wanted to set the bar for amazing exceptional customer service if you feel anything.
4:54
But except for customer service, please, let us know.
Okay?
And calling people when they don't show up for a week because you have red flags that are clear indications of behavior that precede a cancellation.
So if you're tracking those things and you're not, you should be.
But if you're tracking those things, then you can start retaining customers better because most real, I don't know why they left, right?
5:12
You don't know why start asking them.
If you have people canceling, just be like I want to make an amazing business.
And the thing is that people won't even believe you don't look like you're making a baby.
Like, I genuinely want to make an amazing business.
What could I have done better?
What, like what it was, it just like, is it?
Just because it's mediocre, like tell me, it's okay, you know what I mean?
5:28
Like, whatever it is is like you were serving me better by being honest to me.
And rather than saying like, oh no, I just got busy because, like, you, like, you never, I never get too busy to watch Netflix, right?
Because the experience is great, right?
No one's too busy to watch Netflix.
No, I was too busy to always go to the movies or whatever it is, right?
5:45
Or go out to dinner, no one's too busy for that, right?
And so, it's like be honest with me.
And then you have to be honest with yourself and take that answer and then think, okay, how can I make this unfreaking believable?
Okay, so to the point that people are like, oh my God, I can't believe they did this, right?
When you get that reaction from a customer, you have them for Life.
6:03
Alright, so I hope that was useful for you just kind of going through that mental exercise, if like, what could I do to really improve my customer service.
Because that is the thing that gives a small business or a small gym business, a Advantage of in the marketplace because then you actually retain your customers rather than just having, you know, having a revolving door which is obviously not the goal.
6:24
Okay well that was useful, have an amazing day.
Hope you guys are having a rocking morning afternoon evening or whatever it is that you're listening.
This may be in the bathtub.

Good morning, had to choose a terrific Tuesday, tubular Tuesday.
I wanted to make a video about selling things to people so that you would be able to sell more things, more people.
And so, So I've been I've been working hammering away, chiseling away at this.
0:33
Nice script that we're going to diagnostic sale is going to be coming out for our gym Lords Community soon.
It's basically increasing the overall ticket average ticket on the front end by significant amount and close rates.
So that is exciting for us but it got me into sales mindset.
0:51
And so as I've been tinkering away, there's there's kind of one.
Aha moment that you're trying to reach in every sale, right?
And this is the part that But I think a lot of people Miss are people who are new to sales mess up, it's just that they don't know what the aha moment is supposed to be.
1:10
And so the aha moment that you're driving towards, right, everything in the beginning of the sale, when you're clarifying, whether they're right your that's just to establish that you're talking to the right person.
So they you know that your message is meant for that.
Then when you label them with the problem, it's just saying hey we're both saying that this is the goal, we're trying to go to it's literally just clear communication like that is with the beginning.
1:28
Parts of the Sailor meant to do.
The next piece is like, cool.
What have you done in the past?
As to accomplish that you know, to try and accomplish this right now.
You're getting them part of that as pain for sure.
You want to bring up, you want to add some of the pain of what they've done in the past, right?
And elevate it there in there in there awareness, but the next piece is the critical piece and it's the Gap.
1:46
All right?
And it's the question of what do you think was missing from those things?
And why don't you think they worked, right?
Because we have to get them to say, is why they failed, right?
Not just what they did because some people who are, who are selling who aren't experienced in our following a script might just say, well, tell me.
2:03
What you done in the past.
Okay, write it down.
Okay, write it down, write, but you have to figure out the one thing that you're driving towards and there's only two possible real answers to that question of why they failed in the past, that's it.
And you need to get them to say one.
The first, the second or both of them right, which is either they didn't know how or they didn't have the accountability to do it, which means either they did something and it didn't work, which means it was the wrong thing.
2:27
And you can see, it was the wrong thing because it either didn't work or is the wrong thing because it wasn't sustainable, either of those things would be the right.
Way.
But the Crux of the issues that they didn't know the right thing to do, right?
And mind you, this is selling in general, this doesn't have to do with Fitness, like I'm selling business stuff.
2:42
I'm going to say either you were, you did, if you, if you did it, then you're either doing the wrong thing or you doing something that wasn't sustained like the results were sustainable.
One of the other, right?
Thought it was.
The other one is that you didn't do it, which means it was accountability.
2:58
And so the objective in the sale when you're going through the Gap, right?
The aha moment.
You're trying to get them to Say is like, so I didn't like and you're probing, right?
You're acting with childlike curiosity like his, you've never had this conversation before in your life and you're like, huh?
So what do you think, you know, why don't you think that worked?
3:15
You know, and then you're going to continually guide them to say like so so you you think that that would work you just didn't you didn't stick stick with it is that kind of what it was?
Well how many times a day where they checking out with you?
Oh, they were huh?
Okay interesting.
So you know and then you start you start hammering and And layering in the things that you would be doing to make sure that they would be successful in accountability standpoint, right?
3:39
Or oh.
So they had you just eat chicken and broccoli every day.
Huh?
Okay interesting.
Did you enjoy that?
No.
Okay.
Do you think that you would be able to follow that for the rest of your life?
No.
Huh.
Huh, interesting.
Okay, cool.
Good point.
3:54
So like you're saying, you're like, you've never heard this, you've never had this conversation before in your entire life.
All right, childlike curiosity, when you're asking these questions.
All right, it allows people to be it puts them, relaxes that may be lower their guard.
They're like, oh, that's how she's trying to ask questions, right?
4:11
That's all you're trying to do.
But you're driving towards the one point, which is the gap, and the Gap.
In the bridge of where either, on this side of the river, instead of the side of the room, they want to be on as he did because they didn't do it, which means they need accountability or the thing they did didn't work, which means they didn't have the right thing.
4:31
Hey, if you're a return listener and you You have not rated or reviewed the show.
I want you to know that you should feel absolutely terrible about yourself and everything else in the world.
I'm kidding.
But it would mean the absolute world to me.
If you guys would go ahead and do that, you don't have to pause the show, you keep listening and you can just do it with your thumb right now will take you less than 60 seconds.
4:46
And like I said, the only way that podcast arose through word of mouth and this is you joining hands with me and helping as many isomers of possibly can because no one is coming to save us, it's just us.
All right, so please go do that now.
Then let's get back to the show.
Right in a B2B sale for us.
5:05
We usually typically have to focus more on the knowledge side, right?
I'm saying like you were doing the wrong thing because most business owners at least on their belief, they believed they were doing everything they possibly could.
And so I would never question a business owners work ethic, right?
And so if we're selling, we're going to stuff from the non standpoint for the most part in a weight loss sale.
5:24
Most women who are trying to lose weight aren't don't have nearly the prime of the ego that a business owner does.
And so for them you can very easily be like, so no one followed up, you know, I will Course not.
I mean the best people in the world have coaches.
You didn't have a coach, of course, you didn't follow through with your P90X program with no one checked in on you.
Like, that's not your fault boom.
5:40
Remove the responsibility where from them and now they don't feel bad about themselves, right?
And so, the whole aha moment that weird leading towards is that once you've set, hey, why'd you walk in today?
Cool.
So why do they not last month or last year, right?
5:55
Oh, okay, it's important.
Okay, cool.
So, what's your goal is X?
Got it?
Why is that important to you?
Okay, just so I'm I know why, like, the things that are driving that behind the number.
Okay.
Really cool.
Okay, so what have you done so far?
Right?
These are all things that are setting.
The stage for the elbow, drop on why they failed.
6:13
What the missing link was all of that is just to set the stage for this one pivot point.
And it's the point that a people who are new to sales miss, its that pivot point of got it, you didn't have the accountability.
If you had the accountability you think you would have stuck with it?
Boom.
And as soon as you have that, you broke their belief right now, they understand why they failed and now Things seem simple because they understand what they what they messed up last time and then at that point you're miss a awesome Julie you know I think I think you're really gonna like this program.
6:41
I think will be very you know we'll be able to get you here.
You're going since now that I know what you've done, what was missing, it makes sense.
Cool.
So and then you just go right into it, right?
And then you go into the pitch, but you have to get to that point where they admit what the Gap was and why they didn't think they were successful right now.
6:58
You can sprinkle in some more, some more daggers, right?
Little little pain points, if things that should have happened, that would have made him successful them successful the last time, but they have to be the ones who say.
And that's why the childlike curiosity so important.
Because they don't feel like you're pushing them in one direction or another, you're just guiding them along the natural conclusion that they should have already made, but didn't think about it, long enough, right?
7:23
So, so, would it be safe to say that this wasn't a sustainable diet, sometimes the laughs the more where people will laugh and be like, yeah, it wasn't a sustainable that like, Okay, so the goal is just so I'm clear to lose the weight and keep it off, right?
Yes.
7:39
Okay.
So do you think if we did the chicken broccoli thing forever?
That would be a good plan like no, like, okay cool.
Just so, just, so we're both click, right?
And so, you stabbed said, you have I'm building Rapport, right?
As I'm saying this, but I'm also proving the point that the things that them in the past and really makes sense, right?
7:55
So it's like, boom, you're following the wrong plan.
And then it's like, listen, I don't think if you had the most accountability, the world you would have enjoyed life.
You probably wouldn't.
Just stop doing this right, right?
Okay.
So the plan was wrong and sometimes they can both be wrong.
You had a horrible plan and you had no one followed with you.
Of course you failed, right?
8:12
And so once you have those two points, you build rapport because you make them feel better about themselves, but then you prove very clearly why they were why they fail, why they didn't achieve what you're looking to achieve.
And so when you were teaching your sales, people, they have to have the objective of saying of getting the person to the point where they either say they didn't have the right.
8:32
And they didn't have the accountability and virtually, every single sale will lead to one of those two points.
And if you're not driving, that that is why you'll miss the sale later.
And be like I couldn't overcome the obstacles, it's because they didn't, they didn't understand why you were going to solve the problem, right?
And so drive, towards that point, the plane was wrong or you didn't have the accountability as soon as you get them to say, you can go into your pitching, your clothes, your clothes, way more easily.
8:56
Just by making sure that you've broken the belief that they came in for because they don't know why they're not losing weight.
And you're now showing them why and then you're showing them the new way.
Alright, so anyways, hope you guys have a terrific Tuesday closing closing, like mofos, the diagnostic script is going to be coming out soon.
9:13
Right now we're getting people close in two thousand, three thousand dollar tickets on the front end from 28 day from 6 week challenge orientation.
So, just by doing that, we're increasing the average ticket 3 for X, which is pretty fucking awesome.
Okay.
Have an amazing day, guys.
9:29
Keeping awesome, and I'll catch you guys soon.

What's going on, everybody?
I'm bringing some more books, but I wanted to say that, if you haven't checked out Hunter million-dollar offers, I would definitely suggest that you start there.
I've gotten some solid feedback and it couldn't be happier with its.
Number one ranking on Amazon for direct marketing and over 5,000, five star reviews.
So, thank you guys so much for that.
0:15
It's 164 pages.
I really can help you out.
It takes about four hours to get through, check it out.
On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
The audiobook is Lowe's, they'll let me put it on for it, so I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
What's going on?
We won.
0:30
I wanted to make this actually my accidentally hit the button to start recording.
While I was writing some most, I wanted to cover, but I'm going to take this as a sign that I'm actually going to make this.
So I'm calling this for now.
Can you deal with high altitude?
And what I mean by altitude is not like high altitude training, you know, training the mountains and whatnot, where it's harder to breathe because there's thinner, but the altitude of growing your gym, right of growing your business.
0:54
And the reason I wanted to bring it up is because the amount of times that I get asked About bottlenecks in scaling a business or the difficulty of scaling, a business, or the trials personally, professionally of scaling a business, it's almost every single day.
1:11
And like today, I had two conversations one with a woman who's doing about six million a year has four kids.
And she was talking to me about the, the struggle she's having in terms of balancing her priorities and I had another call with a small business owner, who was doing, you know, probably half a million a year.
1:29
And the thing that was interesting is that the way that they were talking to me, was exactly the same and to begin with you.
It's the same way that I would talk to you, is that the air only gets thinner the higher you go.
And so if you're constantly reaching for growth, you will always be out of breath.
1:50
And, like, I just want that to sink in because like people look to me so many times for the answers and this woman who is doing six million year was like, I just want to talk to you about this.
And I want to know, like the solution and I was just like, you will literally never stop feeling this way, as long as you want to grow and the things that like, well then the questions like, how do I stop feeling overwhelmed?
2:09
As I continue to grow the business, right?
So if you're feeling overwhelmed, we do and the actions around that for me, and this is what I took, both of the people that I was talking to both.
Feeling overwhelmed, very different parts of their business, right?
Is first understanding what your plan B is.
2:25
And so, as I have grown in business and skill sets, my plan B has changed the base floor of my building has elevated, right?
And the reason for that is because, like, in the beginning, I had no real skills, right?
And so my base floor, like, I was like, if my gym fails, I'm going to drive, Uber, and strip.
2:43
This was genuinely my plan B.
And I knew I could do, I could make a hundred grand a year doing that, and I could start doing something else after I save the money that was Annually, my plan B.
Once I learned how to make the gyms and I know how to sell, I knew that selling was going to be my plan B Because I had learned the skill of sales and so I was like I can go to a car dealership and I can make a quarter million a year doing sales just hustling.
3:04
I know I can do that and so that became my new base of the building and as you continue to grow, it goes higher and higher and higher, right?
And so now I can vary, I can very comfortably say that like will be fine because of the skills that we've acquired.
3:19
Now, what's interesting about that is that if you think, right now to yourself what like, think, right now, those of you who are gym owners, right?
Maybe multiplication, whatever it is, how difficult would it be for you to go back in time with the skills that you have now and manage a personal training business like for yourself?
3:36
Like just be a personal trainer, right?
Probably won't be that hard, right?
You feel like I could do that against a walk in the park right?
Because you've developed the lungs right and I bet you that when you started that business you felt like you were hustling and Dying.
Right?
Because it was difficult for you at that time because the skill set that you have was not good enough, right?
3:55
If I like a stretch to get to where you are now, but now you have, the you have the lung capacity to breathe cleaner air and so when you go back down to Baseline, there's thick you could run for miles and you don't get tired, right?
And so as you continue to go up the mountain, the are only gets thinner and the competition gets fiercer.
4:14
The problems you have get harder the decisions that I make when I make mistakes are bigger.
Remember when I made my first fifty thousand dollar mistake?
And I was like, wow, that was expensive.
I can tell you two mistakes this year.
That now, at this level in business, have cost me over a million and a half dollars each real mistakes, right?
4:35
The game just elevates the poker chips, just become different colors that you're playing with.
So like the pressure doesn't go away and so if you feel overwhelmed, understand one, what's your plan B 1, you know that you can always liked knowing what your plan B is with the base of your building is can always give you peace.
4:54
Because you're like, I'm okay, all of this is a game.
I choose to play.
I'm choosing to climb this mountain, which is one of the discussions I had with the mother was at who's doing six million years.
I was like you're choosing to climb this mountain.
Like this is your choice you don't have to make it this hard.
5:12
You can go down to three million a year and it'll feel like a walk in the park which is like I want to grow that's like I get that but understand that that's your choice.
All right, and so for everyone who's listening, you have a choice, you don't have to grow.
If you don't want to, if the trade-off that you're not willing to make, that's fine, but just be okay with that and be okay with the fact that like your stretch isn't going to be in this area of your life.
5:35
The next part about going up in the elevation, in terms of dealing with high altitude, is like, can your spouse or partner do with the altitude?
Can they come with you?
The air gets thinner or they going to pull you down.
Are they someone who's helping you are?
They neutral?
Or are they hurting, right?
5:52
A lot of times like the things that are stopping people in their business, have nothing to do with their business.
Most times, in fact, it has nothing to do with their business.
Most business problems are straightforward, right?
It's the personal shit that gets in the way, which is, probably why the number one like most watch or download a podcast, is the entrepreneurial go-to resource which is attention, right?
6:13
Is that they have other things?
They're bringing to the table.
The the smaller business woman that I talk to you.
She had all of these other things that happen in our life.
Well, no wonder the business was stressful because she had no intention left over for it.
And so small tasks seem insurmountable, right?
It takes more effort for them to happen.
6:30
The mother of four, she has an entire family, she's got to do all this stuff for and she's got another site, another business that she's running.
Like, it's unbelievable and I'm and I'm impressed, but when I see someone who's operating at that level, All I can think of is, man.
If you just had one business, you do so much better, right?
6:48
Because like, it's just the attention, right?
You got your splitting your attention.
You're still able to operate at this level mean if you just had one thing to focus on you, crush it.
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
7:04
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
7:26
And so that was ultimately kind of the last thing that I wanted to leave you with was so when you're feeling these these these moments of overwhelm first understand that it's your choice to climb this mountain.
We choose to be in the arena.
We choose to play the game.
We choose to get bloodied up and we choose to keep going because that's who we choose to be right and the game never ends, right?
7:45
Everyone think they're going to win.
There is no winning, I'm telling you there is no winning.
I have more money that I will need for the rest of my life.
There is no winning right?
The game is infinite.
The point of the game is To keep playing.
And so if you understand that that's the point, then you need to recalibrate how you view the game because there is no winning, you're going to keep playing.
8:05
And so you have to think about is how do you want to play, right?
If you're going to stay in writing to not get beat out.
And the only way you get out is by choosing out most gyms don't fail because in fact, most businesses don't fail because they run out of money.
8:23
Most businesses fail, because the entrepreneur gives up, they say, this is too hard.
There's too much shit.
This isn't worth it.
I just don't feel like making this sacrifice for this outcome anymore.
8:39
And that's the point where the business fails most times.
And so, if you're in that Vise, right, you feel the pressure What can you do, right?
What can you do?
First?
Is understand your plan, B.
Second stop doing everything that doesn't make you money.
8:58
Everything that you feel that you have to do.
Stop the easiest way to do this is list out all of the stuff that you have in your brain.
If you feel overwhelmed it's because you have lots of variables in your head and you have onion of decisions that have not been made and they're partially decided and you keep changing them because variables change, right?
9:19
And that's what you can't have clear outcomes.
Put all of them on the piece of like on a piece of paper on a whiteboard or whatever, right?
And then arrange them in organize them into categories.
And then once you see them all of a sudden, the problems and the noise in your life will start going down.
And I do this regularly, I download stuff on my whiteboard and that's what you usually see in the background is I have I start getting stressed and I'm mind up, right then Circle, only the things that actually make you money, not what you think that makes you money.
9:45
That things that's good for you.
That's good for the blah blah, blah, blah, and branding whatever the stuff that feeds you.
And then erase everything else.
And give yourself permission to just do that.
That's it, nothing else.
10:00
Because when the air gets thinner you have left your vision gets foggy and you have to focus on fewer things.
And what I can tell you is that the higher up I go in the more guys, I talked to who are higher up in the mountain.
What you can see across the board is singular, focus is they know exactly what they're doing in the one thing they're focused on from a strategic perspective, as a An individual as a company is to focus on one thing, we're not going to beat them in XY and Z, but we're gonna be the best at this.
10:32
That's what we're going to focus on.
And so one of the signs of a new entrepreneur is because they have a million ideas, they just want to vomit their ideas on you, right?
Zillion things that they want to do all of this potential great, you have Vision.
So does everyone ideas are easy.
10:50
Implementation is hard and so what you have to do is develop the discipline to say no.
And that is what allows you to climb the mountain and be able to breathe and not suffocate, because it gets thinner and harder the higher up, you go.
And so all that to say, if it feels hard, it's okay.
11:11
It doesn't mean you're not succeeding.
In fact, it might mean you are succeeding because it feels hard for me all the time, right?
It feels hard every day and that's okay because that's part of the game and we choose to plot.
And so if you are not Not sure what's going to happen.
11:26
You're stressed.
No, your plan B know what it is so that you can believe that you're going to be okay, no matter what and then look at all the shit that you have to do, cut out everything that doesn't make you money.
And just focus on that and then be abundantly clear with the spouse or partner that you have that this is what you were going to do in.
11:48
These are the trade-offs that you're willing to make and make sure that they are aligned with that.
And if you could do that, you will be able to breathe more easily and adapt to that new level.
And that is how you are able to get to that level and a point where then you start getting bored there and then your lungs your.
12:03
Like, I can keep running here for a while.
This isn't really stimulating anymore.
And then what do you do?
Inflict more pain, upon yourself, and try and grow.
We do this over and over again because we're entrepreneurs because we're addicted to it.
We're addicted to the pain.
We're due to the struggle and maybe you aren't but I am.
12:19
And so anyways, that's for you and so I guess the question I would leave you with is.
Can you deal with high altitude?
Lots of love.
Have an amazing one day.
I'll catch you guys soon.
All right, for all my people be on Thursday, emergency webinar, diagnostic sale sick.
It's awesome Beyond it so you like leave a comment









0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
And this day, everyone.
You guys are having a wonderful wacky.
When tastic Wednesday.
And so what I want to cover today was I was calling cash, flows oxygen, how to get some, but this is actually part of a larger discussion that I'm half targeting towards my coaches and half.
0:47
Y'all can just join in on what I would be talking to him about.
And so, one of the skills that a coach has to have, and if you are coaching yourself, you were the coach, you're the master of your own domain, you're the coach of your own business, right?
And you have to coach you better than anyone else.
Can't write that.
1:03
Have outside counsel that we have judging this.
Well, I get coaching, but you have to be your own coach because you're the one who's going to be making the decisions for your business more than anyone else.
Right?
And so, often times when I am on the phone with a business owner, I am listening for the majority of the time of that call and I'm looking for certain things.
1:21
And so, some of you may have heard of a SWOT analysis, right?
Strengths weaknesses opportunities, and threats more commonly.
Now, an MBA schools, they've actually reversed that, and they called a Natsu, and what that means, Is opportunities.
Threats are disproportionately weighted as far more important and then then you have strengths and weaknesses.
1:43
And so, the reason that I'm saying this is that most times when I'm listening to a client who's saying I'm struggling, I'm having an issue or I'm at a bottleneck doesn't necessarily need to be that they're losing money but just like I can't get past this point.
What's the issue?
I'm going to be looking for cash flow opportunities that are sitting on the ground and massive threats.
2:03
Those are the two things I'm looking for in the beginning.
Once those boxes check off, then we go down to strengths and weaknesses.
For example, if someone is bleeding cash, I'm not going to tell them to to fix their culture, right?
Fixing their culture is something that they absolutely need to do but it's not going to be the thing that's going to save their business tomorrow.
2:23
Right, they need money and so like it's one of the things that drives me nuts because it's not prioritizing the actions according to the, how important they are, right?
And so So an example of this, I mean I just use the culture example but let me look at another one.
Here's a more relevant one.
Retention.
2:39
Right.
And believe me, I'm like the king of making sure that you're doing a good job your customers, right?
But, if your retention is shit, right?
It's absolute shit.
That's an, if you need to make payroll in the next 30 days, implementing retention system is not going to solve your problem.
It's going to take 12 weeks for that, sit, for that to pan out.
2:56
Now this is something you should do.
Absolutely.
After you have milked out all the big opportunities that sit in front of you and ensured that you're not going to kill yourself with rest employee.
Now if you are, if your attention is You're turning 30 percent with one that becomes a threat of saving a weakness.
3:11
It's a threat itself to your business.
Now the number one thing that I see and this is like when I'm getting on the phone now and then like I occasionally take calls which one was to kind of like just poke and listen and I try to advertise because I couldn't hit like I actually thought about this yesterday laws.
3:28
I wonder if I could take one call with everyone.
If I did 30 minutes for every person once a month and I was like, oh no, it's so take me three months so I can't do it.
I tried and I thought about it can't work.
So, he was give you the lessons that I have learned from the people that have spoken with.
And so if, for example, you don't have a one-on-one attrition accountability program that you have plugged into your facility on top of your group training, that is the biggest opportunity that sits on top of your business right now.
3:54
Would you like to have an extra fifteen thousand dollars a month?
Spent zero dollars in ad spend, and get it in 28 days, and you have literally no risk.
And it's only profit that you add on top of your business.
Basically, no cost.
You don't have that cool.
Nothing else that you were going to do is going to matter.
4:10
And so this is called opportunity cost of all of the things that we can do doing this alternative.
What other things are we doing that?
We're saying no tip, right?
Picking out which of the opportunities to focus on is usually.
4:29
The focus of a good coach.
And this is where experience of a coach matters because they have more plays in their Arsenal, they have more cards up their sleeve that they have seen be executed with Precision over a short period of time.
4:44
And so to a new coach, they may only have okay, we need to run more ads, we need to work our lives harder, we need to sell better.
Those are all very true things, those, in my opinion, with sit within the strengths and weaknesses area, right?
But if you are Bleeding cash and you need to make money fast right.
5:02
There are three things that will make you money fast.
One is if like all three of them, by the way, includes selling shit to your existing customers.
That is it, you don't have enough time to start a campaign.
Bring people in Mark, get set, like that takes time.
And if you don't have it, then there's only three ways to make money.
5:20
All three are selling shoes, just in customer base.
All right.
In a gym, the first, and easiest and least amount of anything effort is 22.
Three people run a reason why Campaign which is like a hey I just turned 30 and because of 30, I'm going to take three people with me on a 1-year transformation to me.
5:38
Awesome.
And I'm only, like I said, I'm only Takin three people on this me, three thousand dollars, you know.
Text me.
If you want it just like that, you make nine grand.
All right.
You have 100 people.
You have three, take the offer.
All right, if you need money, that's number one.
Easiest thing to do you want to sell all of those limit?
5:56
It limit yourself, but those cash pops help.
Right?
Cash is oxygen.
So you can buy yourself time to have more perspective to make better judgments about the business.
Next play is you run an internal plate, your existing customers right now.
I guess this would technically be like subset a and subset B, which would be the final two.
6:15
If you have like in a normal gym, if you just want to run like a big booty boot camp or an ABS challenge or whatever, right?
Doesn't really matter, right buns.
And got any of those things, you can Market to your existing customer base and you have to think You can do from there.
One is, you can actually sell the thing itself, which normally you'll get about 20, 25 %, eighth grade of your entire customer base.
6:36
If you saw between 100 and 200 dollars, right?
And so, if you have 150 people, 25%, would be whatever that is, I don't know, like 35-ish 4th whatever somewhere in there, right?
And so you have 35 people who sign up at.
6:51
Let's say 150, okay, well made five grand but then you have some more fulfillments of baby.
The painful thing that the three people might be a better.
A for that.
So we'll see which one if you did the other one recently, then that would probably be the played in Hey guys, love that you're listening to the podcast.
7:08
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects more visuals, more graphs, you don't drawn out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, Now, if you wanted to make even more money, right, then you should make the thing free that you're giving away and then upsell them into food and supplements, right?
7:36
Upsell them additional Services once they start because you'll get an 85 percent a crate and you'll close 8090 percent on the upsell, right?
So it's more work but it again in a short period of time.
You can sell people other stuff that's ancillary services and that's all free money.
7:52
There's no, there's no fulfillment that really has to happen, right?
So like you bye.
Something.
Or in our case, you don't buy something, you just go and Prestige labs, and you click, Send and then they never have to touch him Atari.
But point is, is like you're taking something for $5.
You're selling it for 20 and then you just take the in between and that's it, the extractions you keep the money great, right?
8:13
So that's another easy way of making ten fifteen twenty thousand dollars in a month.
The third thing and this is the one that I'm going to drill home for everyone is that you have the same amount of effort that is going to go into to dealing with any kind of internal plot.
8:29
So beyond the first thing which is like quick text blast limited spaces make 10 grand tomorrow but that's like cool mix and rain tomorrow.
But if you want to make like if you want to start having established recurring Revenue, Right?
Add an additional level of service, right?
8:45
Simply giving people one-on-one nutrition, 101 accountability, that's it.
A lot of people struggle with getting the gym.
A lot of people would love someone to tax them every morning.
Ask them what their weight is how they're doing, make sure they show up at the gym.
What this also does is your turn goes to the floor as in like your attention goes up, people start turning out because they've a regular communication hits.
9:05
Now, if I had 150 customers, what would I do?
I would being the enterprising mofo that I am.
Give everyone at my gym. 28 days, free or 21 days or 14 days free.
Depending on how much work ethic.
I have right now, for me, if I get everyone in my gym, all 150 people and amazing one-on-one experience It's that they've never had before and after this 28 days, you can keep doing this for 49 bucks extra week, right?
9:34
And that's half what I'm going to sell new people into it.
So they're getting a great deal, right?
What percentage of people do you think would say you have one-on-one contact with him for a whole month lease?
A half being a third would say probably harder than the third being half would say.
I think it's higher than half but let's just say half right?
9:52
Half stay now you're not going to get 100% a great because you never got hundred percent.
Take right?
On these types of things where you get an 85 percent, let's say you get 120 people to take the offer or you can have to stay.
So you got 60 and you got 60 at $200, a month extra that are paying for one attrition accountability, what's the cost of fulfillment?
10:10
They're very low, right?
20% goes to a coach cool.
So you pay 2400 out of your out of your 12, right?
So you're at 96 and now every single month from this month, going forward, you make your 10 grand a month and that is profit.
10:26
That is in your pocket that you can do tomorrow, right?
So if you're if you need more profit, if you need more cash, there's a million ways to do it.
And a lot of times like and this is me somebody who's a long-term player.
Sometimes, if you need it fast fixing, your culture is not going to do it, you need cash today.
10:45
And so once you can have that and you can plug the hole, you can plug a thread, or whatever it is, right?
Then you can start fixing the processes that got you into this pickle to begin with, but sometimes you need cash tomorrow.
And so those are the three easiest ways that you can get cash.
Tomorrow, the last one, 10 one attrition accountability by my friend because of marketing.
11:06
So don't get scared away.
A nutrition accountability kind of part of the game in your gym owner, that being Said it's free money and so if I'm going to a gym owner, I'm going to check off the boxes of which of these things they have done.
And most times when I look at all the opportunities they haven't, Floor in front of them, asking them to take it.
11:27
And so right now, if you're looking at your business there's probably a million things that you could do and where arguably should do.
But which one thing given the same amount of time is going to make you the most money.
Forget about everything else and just do that and most times you're going to make the right call and what a good coach is supposed to do is figure out of all the plays that they know in their Arsenal, right?
11:49
All the cards that they have to play, which one is best suited to you right now that can have high impact and, and and require low resources, right?
Those are the best high impact High resources, like, yes.
It's gonna take a lot, but it's gonna, it's gonna cost a lot, right?
12:06
Whereas, here, you actually get the benefit of having a prophet without the risk, right?
I'm not saying front ad spend.
I'm not saying, you know, like there's literally nothing that needs to get added to your business, besides one person, with 60 clients, one person can handle that.
And that can be you.
If you want to, you can keep the extra 20 for dollars a month.
12:21
Sure call.
But all that to say, if you're looking at your business, It is your job to be able to weigh which of the things that are in front of you.
Because there's a million plays that are out there, that's where people get overwhelmed.
They're like, I don't know, should I run a 28-day transformation?
12:37
Should I run an internal play?
Should I run a painting fool?
Should I run a year of change?
Your title run, a like dry, run, hybrid who when I want to kind of building nutrition, right?
What should I do?
Look at which one makes you the most money.
It takes the least amount of resources.
Depends on how quickly you need money.
12:52
The money tomorrow you got to do.
Paid in full.
It's give me a text blast to make the money if you can, if you can wait, two weeks to Make the money.
You're gonna do an internal play.
If you can wait a month, to make the money, Then you should probably do hybrid.
Give everyone the free play.
Now you just add in 120 Grand a month to your facility Top Line, right?
13:10
And then bottom line, you add actually sorry you would add more than that top, like, 144,000 top-line, 120 bottom.
All Right, One play.
Is it worth it arguably?
Well, most people do not that and that's why they struggle.
So don't be one of them cash flows, oxygen.
13:27
Make sure that you prioritize, the opportunities that are bigger.
And once you do that, Lets you execute those things, then?
Yes, you have cash flow to breathe and then you can invest in things that will actually solve your problem.
Then you can pay someone to start helping retain your customer so that you don't have the term problem and you can wait 12 weeks.
13:43
And now you have cash flow from the recurring Revenue stream that you took a month to build.
Alright.
So I hope that makes sense.
Drop a like drop a comment tag.
Someone if you feel like it three ways to make cash in the next month.
Lots of love.
Keeping amazing.
Have a wacky.
Wonderful Wednesday.
13:58
All right, be cool.
Lets you execute those things, then?
Yes, you have cash flow to breathe and then you can invest in things that will actually solve your problem.
Then you can pay someone to start helping retain your customer so that you don't have the term problem and you can wait 12 weeks.
And now you have cash flow from the recurring Revenue stream that you took a month to build.
Alright.
So I hope that makes sense.
Drop a like drop a comment tag.
Someone if you feel like it three ways to make cash in the next month.
Lots of love.
Keeping amazing.
Have a wacky.
Wonderful Wednesday.
All right, be cool.









0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review if it was a post if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur agents.
Whenever one of you guys are having an awesome start to your Thursday Day, I'm here at the proposal.
Are taking a quick morning dip to clear my head because that is what I've been trying to work on is show up at her as leader.
0:40
So anyways, I was feeling this.
I wanted to bring it up to you guys, so I wanted to talk about good advice from good invention, people and bad advice from good people.
And I think it's one of the hardest things that you struggle with is and entrepreneurs.
Who do you listen to, right?
Where do you get your information from?
And how can you test, whether or not that information is valid or good for you to act on?
0:59
And so I was talking Into a friend earlier this morning who's got six locations and they're trying to you know, they're thinking about going into licensing and he's kind of go back and forth between selling his six locations, keeping them, keeping one of them etcetera and so he was like what do you do when you sold your sticks?
1:15
And what I want to tell you is I actually did what most people would consider and a non ideal outcome.
And so what I mean by that is that I got advice from most people to not do a lot of the things that I've done in my life and these were people who had very good intentions, and so parents.
Parents friends, you know, mentors things like that.
1:32
And so but the decisions that we ended up making ended up being the right decision for us and so like, for example, when I had the gyms that I had actually sold five of them and close down one of them, right?
And I could have sold all of them and I could have probably bundle them together and I could have gotten a broker and probably sold for probably three or four times the amount that I did, but I'm a big believer in.
1:55
So, I talked yesterday about opportunities and threats and when you have an opportunity, To you or you have made the decision to capitalize on a new thing that you're going to do to go all in on that thing.
And so for me, the added benefit of waiting a year to get the ideal outcome was not as good as taking a non ideal outcome, but taking a bigger win, overall in the macro picture of life.
2:17
And so I think a lot of times people with good intentions will give you advice with a micro perspective.
And so it's kind of like the advice, like, save your way to being a million, you know, Be A Millionaire, right, like, never gets Starbucks never go out to eat like all that kind of stuff.
But like and the thing is, is like for somebody who's going to be an employee, who's going to be on a fixed income?
2:38
That's kind of the only way to do it unless you want to start making more money on the side which then means you're entering into like the entrepreneurial route, right?
And then again, that advice, no longer is valid.
And so, there's like it's that's why it's so hard having this big bucket of like what is good advice vs.
Bad advice because like there's really just contextual.
2:55
Is this good advice for me right now and so the The way that I've always navigated this is looking at it in math, terms of opportunity cost of how much and this is really, really like.
This is this is 100% hide how I weigh out these value equations.
3:11
And honestly, how I can drown out the noise of like my parents saying, this is stupid and how Mentor saying I shouldn't make this call.
But just simply saying, how much will I make?
If I were to start fresh on this new opportunity where this new thing compared to the current opportunity vehicle that I'm in right now?
3:27
And so for them they were like, you spent the last you No, three and a half years.
Four years pouring your soul into building these gyms and making them profitable and all the hardships and blah blah blah there.
Like, how can you just walk away from that?
How you can just, you know, in their minds throw it away because I was just basically selling it for like one or one and a half times earnings and I was just like because the thing that I'm going to do next is going to be so much bigger and me waiting a year to do that is going to lose me what I would have made in the first year of that business and lo and behold when we you know, when I sold all the gyms the very next month I did to over And my first month.
4:01
And so I was able to replace, you know, majority of the income that I had in the first month of switching to a superior opportunity vehicle.
And so to take this back to like, okay Alex, what is this mean for me?
A lot of times people have really good intentions and they're not bad people and they give good advice for most people.
4:21
It just may not be the right advice for you right now.
And so, I guess what I want to say is like I want to encourage any of you who are like Like if you're done with something, then be all in about being done with it and that's that, that advice is really never Disturbed me and I do want to make sure that when you're making that kind of decision, you're not making a permanent decision based on a momentary emotion, for sure.
4:45
Like that needs to be logical decision that you've come to.
But once you've made the decision in a non-emotional neutral place where you've looked at the math purely, not not looked at the math with an emotional perspective of like, this could be amazing.
You know what I mean?
But like really, What is realistic?
What are some other people who have done the same path?
5:00
You know, what are expected, earnings things like that.
When you when you make that decision, then go all in.
I sold all of my gems from beginning to end in 120 days, like from beginning to end, all of them were closed.
I was out of the leases I had cash in hand or payments at started, coming for the ones that I did payment payment, plans for and so, and I sold five of them to five different owners, actually.
5:25
That's not true.
I sold.
Three, two, one owner.
I sold one too.
A competitor I sort of 12 client and then I closed one down and so but I mean, I had a very deep, you know what I mean?
Like I basically was just like, I'm getting I'm moving on with this.
This is a this is a essentially, a fire sale, you know, I mean like I'm moving on to the next step for me and so if, if you get to that and it doesn't have to be with like at the macro level of your gym, but it can be with any decision.
5:50
Like if you're done with something, be done with it trying to then go from like I'm done to.
Let's get ideal.
Outcome are two very Contradictory feelings, and they're very two, very different action sets that you take based on that decision.
And usually, if you're looking at the opportunity cost of the time, it's going to take you between fire-sale to Ideal outcome.
6:10
And then you measure how much more you would make in the new thing that you want to do or the, you know, whatever the Endeavor that you're trying to take on is if you can measure that difference and the differential is greater to doing the thing that you want to do.
Then it makes math sense to do that and cut ties with the other one as fast as As possible so that you can move in that direction.
6:32
Hey guys real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 million dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
6:51
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
Its fo free in exchange for your email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller, All Leads and so that you can not miss out on it because last time I sold out for like eight straight weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
7:09
And so, I just want to give you advice that I didn't get when it comes to, like, making big moves.
I've always always moved in the direction of, like, making big moves, making the decision and executing, and I'll take time to make the decision.
7:25
But when the decision is made, it's made and every day that I don't act on that decision.
As a day that I become weaker, and I become less certain of myself.
So it's like, once you have made it, then prove to yourself that you're you have balls.
And I say that with love two women, you know?
A big ovaries whatever and that you make the call and you move forward.
7:42
And a lot of people who are non entrepreneurial who were you know, more security driven, things like that will be like you shouldn't move this fast.
It's not good to do things quickly, you know, it's, you know, you should take more time.
You should.
You should like really think about this more.
It's like, well, that's just because your security driven and you sit in your car and your blanket of comfort.
8:00
And you don't realize that there's still an entrepreneur above you who's worried every day about the business that you're getting paid, for still being there tomorrow, you know what I mean?
And so that's just Just because they live in a false sense of security but and so they play off of rules that don't actually exist.
But for you, and I, for those of us who are entrepreneurs, for those people who are taking the risks, then way your decisions, make the decision in a non-emotional place, and then we make the decision, go all fucking in, and be done with it, so that you can look at the opportunity cost.
8:29
Now that being said, if you have a business where I'm just giving you an example, this may or may not be relevant to some people listening, but like, let's see if a business that can sell today.
Three million dollars.
And, you know, with a proper process can sell for ten, right?
And the proper process would take an extra, let's say nine months.
8:48
Well, then the equation would be, will I be able to make an extra seven million dollars in profit from a new Endeavor in that period of time?
And if it doesn't look like that's the case, then you should wait and do the right process.
But basically what I'm saying is, you need to look at the the Delta between what you can get in.
9:08
In a, in a in a short period of time, if I'm not saying this is necessarily for an exit, I'm just using this as an example, it could be anything but what you can get in a short period of time compared to what you could get over a longer period of time and then what the opportunity cost of doing, the other thing that you would do in that meantime and whichever one is greater is the one that you should do and you should act on that in the moment and fuck everyone.
9:28
Also tells you otherwise, that being said, the last words of it last words of advice.
Sorry.
For all the advices this morning, but don't listen to me.
You want to make more than me.
Like what?
9:44
I think one of the most dangerous things in the world is listening to people who make more than you rather than listening to people who make what you want to make.
And that's something that I think I've learned as well because like, when I was starting out, there are plenty of people who made a lot more than I did.
But when I look now back on the advice that they gave me, it was based on their view of the world in the lens that they how they saw things.
10:04
And it wasn't really the best advice, it was just the advice.
Us from their perspective.
And so I think that like, listen to Titans, you know what I mean?
Listen to listen to the Billionaire's, listen to those podcasts watch those guys talk because they will be able to give you perspective from, you know, 10,000 foot view of the things that are really going to drive the outcomes that you're looking for.
10:26
And so, like, don't be afraid to not, listen to people if it doesn't feel right for you, you know, and a lot of times they're just giving you based on the experience that they have and they're projecting it onto you.
And I do the same thing to everyone.
Talking, you know, it's everyone who's on here right now.
Like I I'm just giving you my experiences and how that's worked for me.
10:44
There might be another guy who's made, 20,000 times more than me, who's like, never do that.
But that's just, that's just my, my two cents in my angle.
That has served me, well, you know, with our businesses and whatnot.
So make sure that the people that you're listening to have achieved what you want to achieve, not just more and I know that's a little bit counter to some of the internet marketing culture of, like, you just need to be one step ahead of the people that you're trying.
11:08
To serve.
I think you need to be 20 steps ahead of the people that you want to serve, so you can actually see the Battlefield 4.
Not like, just the next step because if you only see the next step, then you might not know that they would have to back step that one step two steps from now.
And so that's where that's where that's where this is kind of coming from.
11:25
As if you can see what ten steps ahead, look like then you can actually figure out how to get there in six rather than being one step ahead.
Like I think it maybe works from a from a selling someone stuff standpoint but it doesn't really work from a long-term serving that person standpoint.
So Anyways, I hope you all have an amazing Thursday, twelve.
11:42
My jewelry getting on for the diagnostic.
So this afternoon, I'm so pumped right now.
The highest person is getting twenty seven hundred dollar average ticket on the front.
End for people walking in from normal promotions, which is really cool with 100% of people going into recurring at higher average prices, with no abandoned hope sales it.
11:58
So it's really, really game-changing.
Very excited about it.
And yeah, so I'll see you guys on the call.
Otherwise lots of love.
Drop a comment.
Drop a like if you thought it was viable, otherwise you can tell me to go fuck myself.
Right.
Lots of be awesome.
Right.
Lots of be awesome.









0:00
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into.
0:16
And if not keep enjoying the show when everyone happy Saturday I am here at Pirate's Cove in Nevada.
And it's sweet.
Anyways, what I wanted to talk to you today was I have the tiger so I just had our like a 3-day Mastermind type thing with the top seller.
0:35
So, two to three gyms you came here were over seven figures and the other one is kind of probably hit it within the next three months.
So it's really, it was great because it's really higher level conversation.
But I might typically have with a much worse, which is fun and what we talked about was kind of more amorphous, but I think it's incredibly valuable and I think it's probably the one.
0:55
Thing, that sets apart, the guys who are really winners / gals, who are really winners and the ones who aren't and so it's really just around hunger.
And what I mean by that, is we like if recently I had some of our, some of our older OG gym or it's been a while, you know, I mean, they, they turn their dream around the throne there, you know, you know, close to seven figures or right around there.
1:19
And they've been doing it for a while and they were complaining about show really.
Hey, our show Rachel up and You know, you go through the sand while you're doing the reminders.
Are you doing all this above?
Yeah, we're doing all this up.
Okay, cool.
And I did a little bit deeper and I look and it turns out that they're only open one hour per day.
1:38
At 7:15, a.m. for their availability.
Availability for new clients.
And I'm like, how the fuck do you think that you're going to grow your business?
If the only time that you can take new customers is that 7:15 a.m. like in what world does that make sense, right?
1:56
Like imagine a grocery store that's only open from 7:00 to 7:30 because that's when it's convenient for the owner.
Like what chance do you think that that that grocery store has at succeeding virtually none.
And so what happens is people have success.
2:12
They implement Tactics.
They use Jim watch and then they make money, right?
And then what happens, they get comfortable, they get complacent, right?
And they lose their hunger.
And so, all that's like, after that point everything, like, it's almost like I was mostly like, after you after you've liked quote, made it in your mind.
2:30
And that's what's funny, is that making in some people's mind is like having ten Grand in the bank account.
So, like, it's scary in terms of what level of making it is.
But like, once people have made it, I almost want to say, like, none of these tactics matter, because you're just not hungry, like it is.
Outer like the obvious shit you aren't doing, you know what I mean?
2:47
Like, Like I'm trying to like wrap my head around it.
Like if you were if your child was going to die or your spouse or your significant other, your family member, whatever it was right, who's was going to die unless you succeeded, unless you've got more clients unless you made more money with your gym.
3:06
How would you approach it right?
Would you only be available for one hour a day?
Would you only be available from 7 to 8 a.m. right?
Would you?
Would you would you only set aside an hour a day to prospect for you?
Customers would you only reach out to your customers if they hadn't shown up for a month?
3:25
Like Like sometimes people ask questions that they already know the answer to, it's like duh no shit, right?
And and, and it goes back to the, the main thing, which is like, what drives you, I think, what drives you what drives you to be better, what drives you to continue to want to win.
3:43
And it'll, I was asked that question yesterday by the gym owners that were here, and I think, honestly, it comes from a dark place.
And I think I've said this before, but, like, I'm saying it again, because I think people need to hear it, like, Sometimes you have to wonder like why is it that only when someone else's life is on the line, right?
4:06
Do you then actually try right?
Like why is it only then you actually cut all the noise out of your life and then it would go laser focused on actually succeed.
Like why can't we do that all the time, really?
Why can't we do that?
Because it's a world that I wouldn't be happy whatever, right?
4:23
And like, whatever happiness means.
Right.
And so like the people who are the most successful, What in the world are driven by something that is deep inside of them.
That is normally it insecurity or fear of some sort.
If you are only trying to make enough to live on, you will always only make enough to live on and you will slack the moment you get comfortable and you will wonder why is it that?
4:49
As soon as I start making money, I stopped because you actually don't want to make for.
That's why you actually don't want to make.
And so you're in, Colonel motivation is not there, they because you've accomplished what you set out to accomplish.
And so the real question is do you actually want what you claim to want right?
5:09
Do you actually want because if you did, you'd already have it, you'd already you'd already be willing to sacrifice other things in order to achieve it.
And that might mean like maybe waking up earlier, maybe you like working for to 8 p.m. to take sales appointments or whatever that thing is right.
5:25
But like it's just the obvious shit.
Like, if If you were coaching you, what would you recommend you to do, right?
Like, a lot of times if you think about it, like, You most of the time, know what to do like you do on some level.
5:41
Like like you probably know that you're like, man, I do stupid shit sometimes, right?
You probably think that on some level sometimes, right?
Then you like men, if I were, if you could step out of yourself and say I need to coach myself, you probably have the answer, right?
5:57
And it's just that you don't do it for some reason.
And so, all of your attention should be on that reason.
Why is it that this thing?
Preventing me from doing the things that I already know I should do.
Right?
Most like this last Master my that I had sort of the, for the top sellers was really interesting for me, because it was the first time that had no one who had extra shit.
6:15
I didn't have any, like everyone.
There had really like clean lives outside like really focused and just focused on doing the things that we're going to run the business.
And so the conversations are actually really easy and very direct most times.
It's like, okay well here's the obvious hole in your business.
6:35
Yes, but you're not doing anything about it.
So let's attack why you're not doing anything about right?
And so then I have to spend the next hour and a half digging into why they're not doing anything about it.
Which has much more to do with, how they manage their head space and how they manage their relationships and how they manage their, you know, because what ends up happening, is they start focusing on the business, the personal life goes to shambles and then they then are like, oh my gosh, my personal life is going to shambles, I need to stop paying attention.
7:01
My, my business, they go to pay attention their personal life and their gym explodes.
Right?
It's just this this consistent cycle because they just don't know how to just do both right or they don't know how to prioritize.
And so all this to say like, Hey Mose, an Asian quick break.
7:21
Just to let you know.
We've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright so send me a connection request.
A note.
Let him know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or Layla's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
7:40
It's just like how hungry are you like how willing are you to put in what you need to achieve like and if you're not, then that's cool.
Then just to stop stop saying you won, you know, I mean, just be like, I only want to make ten thousand dollars a month.
That's it.
It's like cool.
Then just say that and be good with it rather than constantly complaining about how you're not.
7:58
Because you're not even willing to do the things that that you already know you should do.
They're like, like, right now I get on the phone with Jim wanted to like I know I should work my leaves harder.
I know, I know I should go through the sales training.
More like I know, I should, you know, go through the portal.
I know I should, I know I should meet with my team or I know I should form a like, then why aren't you Why aren't you at Y at y?
8:21
Like I know like I know you have time because other people have time and had the same business as you so you have time.
So why aren't you right?
And it's like what?
Like because once you have the tactics, right?
And this is one of the biggest, the freeing and also most soul-crushing parts of Jim launch is that, once once, once a geometer joins Jim launch, you know how to make a seven-figure jet.
8:43
You know how to do it and so, then it reflects back onto you, it's like, oh shit.
I'm the reason that we're not there and you have to swallow that red because up until they go to gym, lot of people been doing it for five years or seven years, eight years.
8:58
And they're like, I don't know how and then once they see how then the oh shit, I'm not sure if I'm willing to do that.
It's like cool now but what if they know that there is no secret, there is no hack.
It's literally like microphone was, he uses the term chopping wood?
Like I call doing the boring work is like chopping wood.
9:14
It's reps is day in day out, you got to reach out to people, right?
You got to give great service.
Right?
The handwritten cards like remind people to weigh in.
You have to work the leads.
When the person comes in the door, you have to be enthusiastic, got a green with a smile.
You have to ask the same questions over and over and over again because to that person is the first time they've ever heard right?
9:35
And it doesn't matter if it's the hundredth time that month, you asked the same questions to that person to that person, stay warm.
And so, if you were trying to be successful, do you think that only having availability for sales appointments, at 7:15 to 7:45 in the morning one?
A day is going to get you the optimal outcome.
9:54
Do you need a coach to tell you that?
Really, you know what I mean?
Like really and and so like or there was another one that I saw that was like between 9 a.m. and 11:00 a.m. that was their availability like, hmm.
Good luck with that.
10:10
That's when that's when the people who have the most money are available, right?
I do during the week.
So like we know what to do, right?
Anyone who's in our world, like, you know what to do?
It's just, you have to figure out why you're not doing it, right?
And then attacked That because the tactics aren't the thing, right?
10:28
The tactics are there you can read a book and give it away for free, right?
Like you can do that.
But like, figure out why you're not hungry, figure out why you're not true, like why you're not trying?
They just figure it out.
Like there might be something inside meeting, don't want more and like, you need to discover that, it's okay.
10:44
Then like now, you know, but like if you claim to want more and yet you can't do what's necessary to get more.
Then that's where your attention should go.
And you should figure that out because otherwise it doesn't matter what tactics there are you're just not going to do them anyways.
11:00
So what's the point right?
So anyways it was incredibly refreshing to have the three guys who are out here.
We had tourney microphone so both of those guys have been over you know some figures roommates for a while and doing really really well and and Aaron Aaron Stafford just started inside of three, hundreds of people as for six weeks.
11:22
It like 80,000 dollars and something sales and six weeks which prequel.
So any of those guys were just like what do I need to do?
Like that because they're like they're clear ice, you know, toes forward know exactly what to do.
And I was like, why is it that these meetings are so much easier than some of the other meanings I had?
11:38
And so, we've probably spent a little bit of the day kind of digging into that, and it's just a question.
How about you want it?
I really think that's it and, like, figuring out why you're not doing, what you already know, you should do.
In order to achieve it like do you need to go pay someone?
11:56
A bunch of money in order to then get motivated.
I don't know.
Like, hopefully your kid doesn't need to be kidnapped in order for you to get motivated about your business, hopefully, right.
And so it's like, what, what is that thing for me?
It's just fear.
It's just fear and insecurity fear failing, fear of, not being good enough, fear of people, who hated to be right.
12:14
You know what I mean?
That's what my fear and so I did just like that's what drives me.
It's not about money.
It seems like it's it couldn't have been about money because I don't need any more for the rest of my life, like at all.
So I guess it can't be about that.
If it is like about that for you and you feel like when you make your first twenty thousand dollars take home with your first 40,000 or take a month or first 50,000 100,000 or take a month.
12:32
But first time you hit that, like if that's where you're like, oh, you feel this, big sigh of relief, then your motivation is not coming from the right place.
I'm time, I'm telling you straight up.
If you feel relief when you make a lot of money, one month, your motivation is not coming from the place of a champion. if you want to be the best in the world at something, that's not going to do anything for you.
12:54
You shouldn't feel anything from them.
And so, What do you feel to feel nothing?
Really because it's not about that.
That's just that's just an output.
That's an output from internal efforts and should be focused more on the internal efforts and all of the deficiencies that you probably had in still hitting 100K.
13:15
It's like, oh my gosh, if we hadn't done this, this, and this, we would have been less, right?
And if we had done this in, this would have been more like, that's what you're focusing on, and you're only focusing on those things.
And if you can do that, then you'll be able to unlock something inside of you.
That's much stronger than what might currently be driving.
13:34
So anyways guys, hope you have an amazing Saturday.
Drop a like if you feel like this is cool, drop a comment.
If you like it was cool if you don't, then that's cool too.
So anyways guys have an amazing day and I will catch you guys soon.
Hopefully, that was viable for somebody who is on the fence, who's like not sure about why they can't achieve what they want, why they can't be consistent because your motivation is not coming from the right place, right?
13:56
You're just trying to make enough money to live on and the moment you make enough money. you stop working and then you wait for things to blow up again until you try her again and it's like it's like it's not How many times?
All right, I'm going on.
S little ramp.
14:11
How many times have you needed to make money?
And then immediately made the amount of money that you need it in like a day in like a week, right?
Need to make payroll and I make 10 grand next three days.
Howdy, how many times has that happened to you and you always make it work?
Why?
14:27
Because you already know what the fuck to do, right?
You just choose not to do it.
You choose not to do it.
You choose not to make money when, you know, how to make money because whenever you need to make money, you make it.
And so that's What you have to attack, you have to figure out why when you already know how to make money, you don't do it.
14:44
That's the that is the that is the the summary of this entire this entire talk, that was trying to get out of myself.
As like you already know how to do it.
When you need to do it, you do do it.
So why aren't you doing it?
That is what you need to focus on.
And if you can conquer that piece, no amount of money in the world will satisfy you.
15:03
And that is what's going to unlock, your ability to become greater, and for you to build your business to something.
Is much greater than yourself because if the only thing that you want to satisfy is you you're going to see this wall.
That's it.
See this big because the satisfy a single person or a single family doesn't mean a lot, right?
15:21
But if you want to satisfy Community, you want to satisfy statement satisfy Nation.
You want to satisfy entire group of people?
It has to be bigger than you and so yeah.
Anyways, hopefully that my resonated with somebody.
If it didn't, then I apologize for the agree extra aggressiveness on this Saturday morning.
15:37
But anyway, Stop like Drive, comment.
And I'll ask love, I'll catch you guys on the flip side.
Alright.









0:00
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show and coming back from a beautiful weekend in Vegas, Pirate's Cove.
0:24
And I wanted to talk about proper color and I want to talk about it because it is that we as entrepreneurs do all the time and a lot of us don't do it very well.
And I think that the number one thing that I get pulled on the phone for and I get comment.
You know I get tagged in and I get DM did is because people have problems and they don't know the answers, right?
0:44
And so one of the biggest lessons that Leyland I have learned as we've grown our business is kind of the the unsexy truth about problems and the it's that it's usually the really shitty obvious answer.
And so what I mean by that Is that for example, if you were trying to you know get leads in the door and you're like, man if Ike this campaign isn't working it's usually not because of your Facebook bidding or because of the you know, our audience that you're doing or the demographics or like crazy Facebook algorithm whatever it's usually because the ad sucks, right?
1:19
It's usually because the crate is not compelling, it's usually because the offer is not very good and the messaging isn't clear.
As in people, just don't even know what to do next, right?
Like one of the biggest things I guess.
Like the biggest advice that I can give for like copy and creative and marketing, it's like just be ridiculously clear and assume you're talking to someone who's in the third grade or less like why is the big like why does every single like the presidential candidate that speaks to the lowest dialects in terms of reading level?
1:44
Always wins is because most people just don't give a lot of attention to when they're listening to and doing things.
And so the clearest simplest way of communicating typically works and so it's like, man, my Legion is working.
I should probably go through this Advanced Facebook course, probably not.
2:00
Right.
Probably just need to make the ad better because it probably just sucks, right?
It's like man my pages in converting like what are the what are the hacks to get the the pages to work better at, right?
It's like you know, I got to do load times, I get it and sure it's tough stuff works to boarding a fast load times important to have all that stuff but usually it's because the headline doesn't make any sense and it's not connected to the ad that they clicked on writer looks and feels different than the advertisement or it's connecting to something that's not congruent.
2:27
And so like Simple shit, right?
It's the big obvious shitty truth, okay?
And then let's say, for example, that this person magically makes it past the ad magically opposite and then they're, they're scheduling my schedule right sucks.
People aren't scheduling up my thank you page.
Well, it's probably not because the load times are because you have some fancy schedule is probably because the availability that you have is shitty Right?
2:50
You get horrible times and it's unlikely that the person can make those times because you're only doing it to the 30 minutes that you can do every other day and that's not convenient, right?
If, for example, you suck at sales or your sales, numbers are terrible right here.
Like man, I've got to, I've got to learn some super, super secret selling stuff.
3:06
Not really, it's probably because you're not going through the basics of like labeling, the pain, asking them why they even came in today, like, figuring out what's been missing in their life and why the solutions they've done in the past didn't work, right?
And then making him an offer.
That's relatively compelling giving him a guarantee things like that.
3:23
That would actually get someone who's normal to say.
You know what?
I'm going to forego the fact that I just met you and I'm going to sign up, right?
And then you're like man, like my retention is horrible.
I why are why are people leaving?
It must be because the Facebook algorithm is attracting weird humans into my gym.
3:39
It's like Warrior classes suck in remain or rather.
They probably don't suck.
They're probably just mediocre right?
And maybe everything's mediocre and what I mean by that that might be Hard to hear.
But the reality is that the people can hear that naturally do something about her than what you're going to be with.
And so like when Layla and I look at the problems that we have in our business, because believe me, the problems don't stop, they just get bigger and hair, because there's just more stuff on the line.
4:02
When we look at the problems that we have were usually like, what's the big obvious thing?
Like, what's the really obvious shit?
Because entrepreneurs, a lot of times we don't want to face the fact, right?
We we don't want to say what a my trainers.
Aren't that good, right?
One of my sessions do just average right?
4:18
Because like you're seeing people were Cops.
You're like it's a success but on average it just might be average.
And if your average, it's really hard to win, right?
It's just, you're going to compete in the middle, that's where everyone else is and everyone else's problem.
So you want to be like them, right?
And so, then you're like, man, no one's ascending, right?
4:34
No one's taking our upsells.
No one's, no one's.
No one's buying semi-private knows where I repeat Enos.
Driving nutrition accountability, which we branded as hybrid, but is actually just attrition accountability.
No one's buying it.
Well, it's probably because the first thing they got wasn't that good and they were like I don't want to risk something else because this one I'm not really already that satisfied with either, right?
4:54
And so, one of the hardest things in the world is just looking and being like, huh, why what would somebody much dumber than me?
Think if they looked at this, right?
If I were to ask somebody off the street.
Hey, no.
It's coming to my gym.
Why do you think they might be?
Like maybe you're just not that good, right?
5:11
But like we're like no it can't be that.
It can't be that it must be something really Advanced and Technical in it and have all these hairs on its like know.
It might just be that And it's usually because simple problems have complex answers, right?
And that's, and that's one of the, like I think Trevor catchy, says, while he's like, short questions, have long answers, like, what is the meaning of life?
5:29
Very long answer, right?
What is the calorie very long, you know?
Like it's like there's there's long answers, sometimes two short questions and so it's like, why are people leaving, right?
There's a lot of facets to it.
It's usually because once you face the reality of the music and you just accept responsibility for the fact that maybe just maybe the food at your restaurant.
5:48
Isn't that good?
Then you have to go through.
The really hard work of examine each piece.
One of the first things that we do, especially if we had something that worked and then stopped working as we examine the people.
So we look at the people, we pull them out, were like, huh, what was it like before?
6:03
When did this person start and did it start sucking afterwards?
If it's a yes then it's usually that person.
So even if I'm like, hey are you working late?
Hey, are you following the script?
The way you're supposed to, when you're selling people.
Hey are you greeting people with a smile right there?
Like yes, of course I am because I'm Those to say that but like are they really right?
6:22
Are they really well if you're looking at the data you're like, okay, everything's going fine and then on Wednesday last week.
So and so starts, then all of a sudden, our showrooms tank.
Hmm, right.
We try to be reasonable and and listen to people.
But a lot of times they're just not executing the process that already worked, right?
6:39
Like for example, if you were like, you were doing great with lead gen for a while.
Right.
And then the big c, word comes along complacency because you're like, you know what?
I got this on.
Block, I'm going to move on to another part of my business to start focusing their cool but then you forget to keep doing the things that got your legion.
6:56
So good.
Maybe you've you're not making 10 ads a week anymore, you're making five.
You're making through.
You're making every other week, right?
And all of a sudden, the actions that got you there stop happening and so the results, they got you there stuff happening.
This shoe is that with business.
A lot of times, the delayed feedback loop, right?
7:13
So you might stop doing some of your attention stuff that you were doing that.
You're doing well, you were talking to members you're reaching out to And then all of a sudden, your gym grows and you stop doing those small touch points and all of a sudden, your attrition goes up and you're like, what happened, right.
I mean, people came in our term was fined and then a couple months later started going up and then the thing is, is that you had Goodwill, you were depositing into the relationship bank and then that Goodwill started getting extracted out.
7:38
And then as soon as there's no Goodwill left nutrition starts biking, right?
And so, when you're looking at problems in the business, start with the big obvious Harry one, which is probably the one you don't want to look at, Then look at, see if there's people who have gone into that process and changed it since like, since stats either went up or down and like she had such a good one.
8:03
Something about the final piece of this, maybe I'll come back to me, but the hardest part is, is letting go of your emotion when you're looking in, appraising your business.
And I think one of the biggest insights that Layla has given me.
Is she asking the question?
8:19
All the time.
She's like, if you were your business coach, what would you tell you?
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to fifteen hundred dollars.
8:34
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
I'm like I've said this before and I'll ask you to say it again, for yourself.
8:51
If you were your own coach, a lot of times you actually have pretty good insight into what like the nice thing is that you're like, subconscious mind, knows everything that's going on in your business.
But when you take the perspective, right?
You say like, well, if I were getting coached, I be like, here's my issues, right?
And if I is, the coach were hearing these things, this is what I would tell back.
9:07
A lot of times is different than what you're actually doing.
And honestly, I can't tell you.
I like sometimes I feel like I coach other people's business better than I coach my own, and sometimes I break my own rules.
Owls.
And then I go ahead and I'm like, wow, that was dumb even coach people not to do this and I make this a freaking mistake.
9:22
And so when you're looking at the overarching process first, look at the big hairy problem and except that it probably is the big obvious one that you don't want to confront and nothing advance.
So you don't need to read another Advanced copy writing Workshop or you don't know.
9:38
Need to go to a seminar on funnels or you don't need to, you know, become a super hardcore closer.
Like you might just not be doing the basics.
Or the person that you put in isn't doing the basics anymore.
And that's one of the hardest parts.
9:53
Because like the thing that gets you to the next level is that you solve the problem.
And then when you move on to the next thing that thing keeps going and that's why sometimes owning a business can feel like spinning plates, right?
It's like oh my gosh as soon as I let this one down the next are like I get this from spinning, the next one breaks or whatever it is, right?
10:13
And the hardest part, if you think about business is a pipeline which I did Encourage you to do.
You have to make it all the way through to the end without anything dipping before you can come back to the beginning.
So what I mean by that is that you have to have lead generation on lock, you have to have nurture on lock, I mean, meaning the schedule and they show you have to have sales on locks, your closing.
10:34
It a high percentage at a high average ticket, right?
You have to have your retention.
Unlock people are staying.
Turn is going down or staying the same, right?
And the Ascension, when you make internal plays and when you have up sells for nutrition, for accountability for Or semi-private, training, whatever it is that people at a, at a fixed percentage, continue to take them right?
10:52
And then once you get all the way to the end and nothing else is Fallen.
That is how you scale.
Because then at that point you go all the way back to the beginning, you say, alright.
I work my way all the way through this pipeline, right?
And nothing broke with 10 leads a day with 15 leads a day, whatever it is, right?
11:12
I wonder if we can do the same thing at 50 leads a day.
And then everything fucking breaks again.
And I promise you that this cycle literally never ends and so if you're wondering like if the business problems that you have and they never will so we just like get you out of that mindset but you have to take them one at a time and you have to usually confront the big obvious thing which is that the fundamentals usually just aren't being done.
11:37
It's really it.
Like when I look at other people's businesses It's usually the fundamentals.
And I'm not even talking, like maybe just talking gems, I'm sorry.
Like I could some other other other business owners Owners who are 10 20, 30, whatever million and they'll ask me, advice on whatever.
And I'm like, are you doing this?
And they're like, I'm not sure like you should probably check because this probably not happening and then they call me back there, like, dude.
11:58
Oh my God, it was a mess.
I went in there.
They were doing any of the stuff that we had that I taught them.
What it's like it's usually that it's usually the big obvious thing and it sucks it like really sucks but This is what we signed up for, you know, what I mean is that were trying to get this machine to work and work, consistently, right?
12:17
And so first, part of the problem then, go to the person and then then only those things, if you really feel like you've done all of those things and you have people consistently executing, then you can look at the process and see if you want to redefine it but only do that once you've been able to consistently get all of the other pieces in place and usually you need to do that first and those little processes that you like, tweaking because you're not have preferred me like fucking with things actually do.
12:41
To be changed.
I can't tell you the amount of times that like I can usually tell, if someone's like, more success for Alexis house, we'll just from like an initial conversation because of how willing they are to break shit, right?
Like the people who are more consistent, make more money, they continue to rinse and repeat until they are bored to death.
13:02
And then they keep going and doing it again.
Because honestly, that's what it is.
Like, marketing is new businesses better, right?
You want to mark it better?
Because better doesn't sound very good.
New sounds good.
New and different is what brings people in, but the same and getting better at doing.
The same thing is what make business is better.
And so it's one of those hard dichotomies as an entrepreneur because you want to because we are usually promoters.
13:23
Like we making like making big white things attracting attention etcetera.
But like the thing that you're usually selling just needs to improve and that's it.
And that's Not sexy and that takes one percent Improvement that takes looking through recordings of sales, people and listening to whether their labeling, the pain, listening to whether they're asking for the sale listening to whether they overcame obstacles and actually tried, right?
13:45
It's like, are they actually making the calls is looking through their phone records?
To see how many calls a day they were making, right?
It's looking inside of your training.
If you have a platform for the trainer to text or the right-hand ring are, so make sure that they're actually doing right looking to make sure that the phone that you have at the gym where you Portal under ads on a regular basis is actually full and being done, right?
14:05
It's just looking and most people don't do that because they're too busy being, you know, lifestyle entrepreneurs and taking pictures on Instagram about how successful they are.
So don't be those people and I hope that makes sense, in terms of problem solving from an approach.
It's usually the big ugly one and it's usually the one you need to tackle.
14:22
Look at the person.
If you're 100% positive other person, then, look at the process.
Usually, don't need to do that.
And then the thing that gets you to scale is to do each of those five things and do them and maintain them.
So that you can go right back to the beginning and break it all over again as you scale.
So there's hope.
Hope you guys have an amazing Monday.
14:38
That was something else on my mind that I figured I would share because it's the number one thing that I get messages about is the little problems that are obvious, that no one wants to look at and so just be your own coach.
Tell yourself what you would tell someone else you told you that's pretend another gym owner.
I see the same questions.
14:54
Usually you'll have the right answer but anyways drop a like drop a comment drop a if you're in the podcast and you're listening, please.
Drop review.
We always appreciate reviews and have an amazing day.
Keeping awesome and keep your hand, because we're all in it together.
15:09
So, let's love and I can assure you,









0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
What's going on over and happy Friday?
Day hope you guys are having a fantastic Friday.
I wanted to make this because I literally just got off the phone with my marketing team and I just gave you two analogies.
I thought they were really good about how to consistently market and always know that your ads are going to convert.
0:45
And so one of the issues that we ran into with our team is that, you know, they get tired of making ads all the time.
They get bored of making ass a man's over, right?
And so they want to flex their creative muscles right?
And we do the same thing as effort.
We want to flex Curry, mussels and think of new hip, you know, new hooks, new new things, right?
1:04
And so, there were some ads, I started seeing from Jim Wallis that were like, you know, how to build a great culture, how to retain people, how to, you know, how is your gym, ready for 2020?
I'm like to no one gives a shit about that, right?
Because the desires of your avatar, don't change the desires, don't change, right?
1:22
And the messaging shouldn't change either.
And so the two analogies I gave for this are that one is a Henry Ford Store in the other is Is a news story.
I think you'll like both things.
I think it really drives the point home.
So Henry, Ford was like going passes marketing department over and over and over again for months or four months, or look at these markings, blah, blah, blah blah, right.
1:40
And so, finally, five months in, he looks at a CMO and he's got this, you know, this Banner this ad of like a Ford car.
Whatever.
He's like, hey man, like when we stopped running that I'm really getting tired of that ad and the CMO was like, we haven't run it yet.
And so the stories illustrates that like just because we think about something and we've run so many advertisements, ourselves, you are avatars.
2:00
They are not sick of it, yet.
We have just seen it 100 zillion times and so you have to always remember that it's their first time seeing it's the same thing.
When someone walks in the door, it might be the fifth person or tenth person.
You've seen that day, you still need to be as chipper as a beet.
Still follow the process with that person because it's their first time seeing you, right?
2:18
And so that's the Ford story, right?
Like we get tired as entrepreneurs because we get bored, we get a TD.
It doesn't mean that the market needs to change story to the easiest way that you can see.
This is with news, right?
So think about the news right there.
Are there kings and queens of capturing attention.
That is what they have done, right?
2:34
They they literally, let's all they did, is they capture attention, they sell at.
That's how the news networks work, right?
That's their programming is news.
But what's interesting and I love this saying is that news does not change only the people as in only the people in the story is change, right?
2:51
I'm going to, I'm going to be a little bit - here just in terms of the way that it's portrayed by like rape murder violence storm destroys area.
Because most news is - because Cuz that's what they know, gets attention because - sells more than positive.
Right IPO of big company.
All that stuff is news.
3:06
The only thing that changes is the characters is the people inside.
And so, you need to see your marketing the same way.
The messaging is going to be the same, the core desires of your avatar.
Do not change, the things they want to hear the promises that are going to be made the results.
3:23
They want to see are not going to change and so you do not need to become more creative.
The biggest and hardest part about business is being boring and consistent because it's hard because humans get bored.
But as you grow and the avatars and the amount of people that you reach grow still, most people have never heard of you.
3:40
I don't really get stopped in the street that much.
I don't, I mean, I do occasionally.
But not really right?
And in your area, you probably don't get stopped in the street all the time.
Your marketing doesn't reach nearly as many people as you think it does.
And so you may be tired of seeing the marketing the way it is, you may be tired of showing great workouts.
3:57
Good food like people getting like weight loss results and you might want to start talking about sustainable sustainable, something in like whatever random ideas come into your head, none of it matters because it's not going to drive the engagement of your avatar because it's you getting bored, not them.
4:14
Ward.
All right.
And so the secret to making great ads, consistently is to bucket out the messaging that works the best.
And so for us it Jim launch we have core messages that we hit them, right?
That we know these seven buckets of things that we talked about or things that generate interest in generate applications, right?
4:33
When I show a gym owner who had seven figures, right?
That is something that people click on.
And so, what we need to do is think how many of these stories can we capture?
Can we do it, as Has can we do it as video?
Can we do it in a short clips?
Can we do as long Clips but all of them fall into that message bucket, right?
4:50
And so that would be a testimonial bucket.
The next tool might be a video of a filled gym, right?
So we know that video is until Jim's work.
Cool.
So we're going to use videos of Phil, Jim's people working out together.
We're going to use videos of Jewelers talking about that.
We're going to images of that.
Those are messaging buckets.
5:07
That do not change and so if you want to make advertising that is great.
Consistently, what you need to do is act like a And go out and find the story.
You gotta find the stories that fit into the buckets that are the messaging that your avatar response to.
5:24
I hope this makes sense, like, this is big and this is how this works.
Like this is how you become a great marketer, you know, the buckets that people respond to how do, you know, go back into your history of your ads?
This is literally, when I was running all over Market, I don't anymore.
Like, I don't do any of that, but when I was, I would go through my publishing tools, I would Look at all of the past ads, and they're all right, there.
5:46
You can see the route.
You can see the clips, you can see everything.
And I would look at the top ten, the top 20, and I would say, okay, these five are all around this core message.
These five around this core message and I pull them up, I pull three or four adso and I'd see the copy and see the image, and I be like, cool, what's another story?
6:03
That does the exact same thing.
And so, I grabbed the story, I grabbed the copy, I put the new image, therefore, the new creative.
And I'm like, okay here.
I've got the new numbers.
Great.
And then there's some flavor text, which might just be the uniqueness of the story, right?
It could be like, with Jimbo number one, their kid was you know, diabetic and they couldn't afford the medicine or whatever it was and that was the problem before.
6:25
The problem afterwards is that now they got the full treatment and they have the pump and they they're good, they don't need any more.
Right?
So there's the before, and after that, it's flavorful that adds this the personal element, to the story, think about it like news, right?
That's how they capture the story.
They have to add the personal element.
Hey guys, real quick.
6:42
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect for you can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I push the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
7:10
So you need to do, all you gotta do is update the numbers of the results of the person.
That's the Tactical stuff that the external stuff that everyone else sees but then the internal stuff is all the stuff the person feels and then went through because that's the human side and that's what matters more most.
But you need to have the other stuff to make sure that you're going to fulfill the promise that you're actually getting something for, but you stopped at a human component to make it relatable, right?
7:32
The make it real and make it believable that that person.
And the thing is, is the pain that you outlined in the story will bring About people who resonate with that pain.
So for example, everyone wants to make more money, everyone would like to work less, everyone wants to scale a business.
7:52
Get, you know, being love.
Like, everyone wants.
Everyone has these core desires.
Everyone wants to have more status.
The question is, whether they believe you or not, and the things that makes your story believable is the personal elements of the individual story that you're capturing that fall within the larger buckets of messaging, okay?
8:10
And messaging is what drives everything like that is.
What?
Like when people are off message, that's when you're at tanks.
That's when it's like, this isn't relevant, right?
This isn't important to me because the message isn't like the promises even, right?
Once you have the promise, right?
The thing that separates a mediocre ad from a home run.
8:28
Grand Slam ad is the personal element that makes it relatable.
The more widely, relatable, the pain and subsequent transformation is the more likely that ad is going to be a grand slam.
Alright, so I hope That makes sense.
That I literally just broke this down for my marketing team and so I just figured I would jump on and hop on with you guys as well.
8:48
But this is how you consistently leads and this is how you want to channel your add into capturing stories that fit within the buckets that you already know work.
And when you want to get inspired to write copy, read copy that has already converted Gary helper which is one of the best all-time copywriters ever his way of training copywriters was to have them hand right. 100 of the Best sales letters of all time because after you've seen enough, what happens?
9:14
Is it starts to become pattern recognition?
You feel like, you know what should come next in the copy because you've seen it so many times, right?
And so like, my team gets on me because they're like, man, feel like you hop on these calls.
You're like change this move this bubble bubble-butt, right?
Like and I'm struggling right now to try and teach the.
9:29
So right now, like the mode that I'm in the skill that I need to learn to move.
My company forward right now is that I want I need to go from being able to double check to having someone else.
Through the same lens has me and so it can be fun for me because I'm going to share this journey with you because I already know how to get, you know, sales teams consistent.
9:47
I've done that here.
I mean we know how to sell and how to teach people to.
So I know how to manage so like I know all that stuff but I know how to Market, I know how to teach people to Market, but I right now I'm at the level have to teach someone to teach people to Market.
That's kind of where I'm at right now.
And so I'm going to be sharing all of the little tidbits that I have right now as I'm going through this.
10:05
But the difference between sales and marketing is that sales is formulaic pretty much every Sales and singing like almost all cells are the same, right?
Why are you here?
Why is this important to you?
It's called label the pain over the past, probably like same thing.
Read the fucking questions marking is a little more nuanced, right?
10:22
Sometimes you have short copy, sometimes you have one copy.
Sometimes you have story based stuff.
Sometimes you have Interruption, but like there's, there's different feelings and that's why I think it's important to make buckets are templates around the different styles of messaging that have converted and worked.
And the reason they're different buckets of because they attract different avatars, right?
10:38
I'm sure within your gym right now.
There's probably Some women who fall within this type of bucket might be a busy Mom, right?
It might be a stay-at-home mom, you might have a non mom who's a, you know, in the workforce.
You might have a sump, semi wealthy single income, Millennial who's 29.
10:56
You might have a empty nester right there different buckets and the messaging attracts different ones of these avatars and I can guarantee you the different message.
Now, some avatars are attracted more than one.
That's fine.
That's great.
And that's when you have the real home runs this.
You have A pain point that can hit on two or three different avatars.
11:14
Salient pain that they have experienced that the story that you are showing experiences that is when things go viral and the News tries to do the same thing.
When they, when they try and find a news that like a story that has has legs, right?
That that starts getting massive amount of reach, it's because the story that's relatable, that's just like you and me and experience a result that everyone wants.
11:34
So, if that was viable, you know, maybe tag somebody who makes your ads, if it's like in your gym.
Jim managers like catching videos and we're not poor like it.
Or if you're listening on the podcast leader of you always appreciate it.
Otherwise, hope you guys have an amazing day.
Fantastic friday, keep crushing your goals.









0:00
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
0:17
First off, I just want to say I'm extremely humbled to be here.
Honestly just hearing the few conversations Audi's.
I was able to have with the people who were here honestly didn't think anyone really knew who we were.
It's not necessarily a bad thing.
We keep very much to ourselves.
0:34
I probably don't leave the house for, like four or five days at a time.
So it's a little bit different than I think.
Maybe most people is entrepreneurial Journey.
But Nolan.
Am I good to rock?
Can't see him.
I'm good to rock.
Okay, cool.
So kind of what David was saying.
0:50
I like to understand who I'm talking to you, so I can try and cater this a little bit more to your desires.
Is that cool?
Okay.
So first thing.
Well, without it It Pretend This is anonymous and no one else knows you're here.
Who here is still working a full-time job?
1:06
Can you raise your hand?
And for like the one moment of the night, this I'd ask you to just not do the like, hey, I'm going to be too cool to raise my hand because then it like it's to your detriment.
So the second thing who here is a full-time entrepreneur, who's doing a hundred thousand dollars or less per year, Okay, cool.
1:28
Who's due to doing between 100 and a million a year.
Okay, who's doing a million plus?
Okay, cool.
A nice smattering fantastic.
All right, so one of the concepts are one of the things that I get asked a lot.
1:45
When I go well, on the rare occasions that I go out in public, is, you know, how do I make more money?
How did you get started?
What should I be investing in?
And I think that it's really important to understand that if someone is able to achieve something faster than you, they're using the same resources that you have from a Time standpoint.
2:06
And so just means that they're allocating their attention in places that they're getting disproportionate Returns on it, right?
And so the objective is, how can we find the biggest Roi?
Buckets that we can put our time into so that we can extract as much value as humanly possible as fast as possible.
2:26
And so, my belief in this is that Information is the single best investment that you can have.
Because information is the only thing that buys you time That makes sense.
A lot of people want to go faster but then they don't want to spend money on learning how to go faster.
2:44
And that is the only thing that gets you from point A to point B in a shorter period of time.
And so we're it gets really interesting is how do you acquire those skills and so I'll give you can.
I give you two like habits that I think have done really well for me in terms of acquiring skills.
3:02
So the first thing is like I was up today at 3:00 in the morning.
I'm usually Only in bed right now.
So this is my amped voice.
But I say that because I also know, so I have a few, billionaire, friends, who are, who are night owls.
3:18
And so, I don't think it's a morning thing.
Specifically, I think it's more important that you can always have four to five hours a day of uninterrupted.
Time to yourself, the biggest breakthrough that I was able to have in my own life from a business standpoint came.
When I was able to move the big pieces forward every single day because I started my day that way and for me, that's what I'm the most creative is in the morning.
3:40
And so that's where I invest all of my time and getting and acquiring skills.
Just so I have an idea.
Does anyone like an early bird here?
Early, birds.
Okay, what is early before six?
Before 5:00.
Before for okay, well it's really big in our community because like so does anyone know what Jim launch does?
4:05
Okay, a couple people.
All right.
Can I give you 60 second picture what we do?
Okay, so we own a company called Jim launch.
We help small business owners that are specifically gym owner.
So, crossfit's boot camp, semi private facilities MMA BJJ type facilities that are service based facilities on average.
4:23
Increase their top line revenue by 240 thousand dollars a year.
They decrease their turn from 10.4% to six point eight percent month-over-month, which is awesome.
They tripled their profit on average and that's in their first 11 months.
Working with us.
Every nine days.
We create another million dollar facility so we're pretty good at it and that has been the focus of pretty much my entire adult life.
4:46
It started when I had my chain of gyms and tell her California, I was able to open up a new facility every six months as a 23 year old off of cash flow.
So I pre-sold every facility so that I can open them at full capacity on the first day, I thought everyone was doing that.
I didn't know that, that was something that was different and so I had my six, I sold them when I was 26 and then I started flying out with my lovely wife, who was my girlfriend?
5:10
That I met on Bumble at the time that I got to quit her job and join me.
Her parents were very stoked.
That she left her job for some Bumble.
Dude on the internet to go launch.
Jim's it.
So she so we would actually fly out to these gyms and do basically like Bar Rescue.
5:27
We do Jim rescue and I did that for six months and then we had an eight-man team and then we did that for another six months.
So every Month.
We'd go out to eight gyms and launch them.
And we'd go from zero to full capacity in 21 days.
And we did that over and over and over and over again, that short period of time that I was referencing.
5:47
The beginning when I was when I had my own six facilities during that period of time, I look back at our CRM and I had done over 4,000 101 sales in that three-year period and so I had my and that was actually closes because I couldn't count consultations You said, no.
6:06
So I did a lot of sales and I'm telling you this because a lot of people ask, like, how did you get here without knowing, how, how to replicate what happened.
And so despite the fact that Jim launched in March of 2017 is when we transition to the model that we have now, which is an information based model we consult and we help them implement the systems to acquire customers, send them increase the value of the services and then keep them longer. but, It's understanding the things that got you there because for us we were able to go from 0 to 50 million dollar a year run rate within 20 months.
6:46
And so a lot of people think that that comes from nothing but a lot of its the eating shit period.
Hopefully the profanities.
Okay, and so when I had my conversation with David and some like my sales guys come up to me and they're like dude I got 25 Grand, you know, I'm feeling pretty good.
7:03
So I'm just like, Curious, you know what kind of Investments should I?
I be getting into, you know, like kryptos looking pretty good right now and and it drives me nuts because I'm pretty sure I didn't have any money in my bank account at any time until I had a million dollars in my bank account within a couple months.
7:24
And the reason for that was because my belief is that you should spend all of the money that you have to acquire skills until you can't spend money on acquiring skills anymore and you can pretty much always Money on to acquire skills.
Its users do it differently and so like the higher up, you go.
7:42
Now, I have to make donations to charities in hundreds and millions of dollars in order to get access to the boards of these Charities, who are other dudes who can donate hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars to those Charities so that I can then see what they know so that I can learn faster.
And so I'm going to give you an example of what this whole concept of talent stacking is.
8:02
So let's say you're good at math, right?
So that's where you're starting your like, I'm good at math.
Cool.
That's a skill, not very monetizable but it's a skill.
And then you're like, okay, well, I could kind of do credits and debits keep someone's books.
Great.
8:18
That's a level one skill.
You've now put two skills together and now you have something that is actually monetizable and you're like, you know what?
I'm going to learn accounting.
All right, so I'm gonna get my degree in accounting so might become a CPA.
All right, now this is something that is becoming more valuable and then you learn about Tax Strategies, right?
8:35
And then all of a sudden you're able to work with a business and save them hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars a year because of your understanding of the tax code.
And then you learn how to decrease liability with insurance because you continue down this path of stacking your skills.
8:51
And then if I'm if you're if you're following along and then like the next round to be like and then I understood how to talk to bankers and financiers and raise funding and do do exits and Equity deals, Etc.
Same person, Stacks, one Talent on top of the other, and each Talent becomes, disproportionately more valuable than the talents of all before them.
9:16
Does that make sense?
And so it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a hockey stick, right?
And so, in the beginning, you don't make anything for a very long time.
And so if you're in the crowd right now and you have not been able to increase your income for an extended period of time, which I would Define, as probably a year if your income is not had a significant Increase in that period of time.
9:37
It's because you've chosen to not look or understand what the next skill that you need to stack on top of your prior skill is in the entrepreneur World, usually who would consider themselves.
Pretty decent at sales.
Most entrepreneurs, right?
We're more promoter type people, and so.
9:58
I hear the stuff all the time.
There's no good salespeople.
I can't get anyone to sell like I can sell.
What's the skill that that person Lacks?
They lack the ability to hire find recruit train and manage a sales person.
10:17
That's lots of skills but that's the essence of what they're missing.
Then they have one or two sales people or three sales people and they're like, man, we have good months and then we have bad months and then we have good ones.
I can't keep it solid.
Like, why isn't it?
It's always variable.
Right?
10:32
What's the skill?
They lack.
They don't know how to manage a sales team and so the biggest piece of advice that I can say is that it's a it's a frameshift that everything is 100% your fault.
And at the same time, there are self-made, Millionaires and self-made billionaires.
10:48
But there are so self made 50,000 a dollar a year errs.
They just don't claim it because they don't want to be responsible, right?
And so you're 100% responsible for the income level that you have, and if you're dissatisfied with, it's because you're just not that valuable And so you have to learn how to become more valuable.
11:05
And the first way to do that is to admit that you have a deficit.
And so if you have an ego about it, you'll be incapable of becoming better than you are.
Does that make sense?
The people who you see, who are really talented, and then cap is because they can't admit that they're not good.
Or they could be better.
11:23
I want to give you a different example of the talent stacking because I want to show that like the math, one's pretty simple because everyone understands it.
So let's say Jay-Z, when he started his career, he understood he had a rhythm, right?
He was naturally pretty good with beets.
Okay, got it.
11:39
Then all of a sudden, he learned how to perform another skill.
So he took his sensitivity to music Etc.
And then he learned how to perform?
Okay, great.
Once he learned how to perform, then he I learned how to sell and Market his own materials, another big skill, then after that, he learned how to create a label, a more, leverage skill, then he learned how to attract and find other skilled performers and bring them into his label and promote them.
12:07
All he did was stack one Talent on top of the other and for every additional Talent he had, he got exponential Returns on the stack.
That was underneath of it.
Does everyone here understand what the next skill that you lack is.
Is there any reason why you're not aggressively pursuing it if you claim to not have what you want?
12:29
If you don't wake up at 3:00 or 4:00 in the morning and you are dissatisfied, I don't get you.
Because for me to satisfaction is so soul-crushing that like I will do anything to not feel that way.
And so might not be in the morning, it might be after you put your kids to bed, but like there has to be that time where you can invest in learning those skills so that you can stack the next thing.
12:53
So, one of the issues with being newer in The Entrepreneur Space is that you see a course that's marketed, you're like copywriting, right?
If I buy this, copywriting course it says I'm going to make money right?
If I By this traffic course.
It says that I'm going to make money.
13:09
If I buy this phone, of course, money sales course money.
Right.
The reality is that it's all yeses and all knows.
It just depends which is the weak Link in the bridge.
That's going to get you from the bank to your first dollar going over.
Once the first dollar comes over, the second dollar comes immediately, right?
13:25
But the thing is, is that you're like, I need to learn how to mark it.
What does that mean?
Okay, I need to learn how to write copy.
I need to learn how to write headlines.
I need to learn how to create creative that.
Attention.
I need to learn how to place advertisements on media platforms.
13:41
I need to be able to analyze the data to know how it's actually doing and know how to adjust it based on the performance.
I need to know how to create landing pages that convert traffic.
Once I have a lead, holy shit, I have a lead.
Once I have a lead, I have to know how to get that person nurtured in such a way that they will eventually convert, and whether that's a phone sale or that's going towards a nurture sequence.
14:05
There's are two different paths, those are different conversion mechanisms, but the point is, you see how each of these is a skill that you have to acquire, right?
And so whenever you see these courses don't get butt hurt that, you didn't make a million dollars after buying one course.
14:22
You're not supposed to And so the goal is to get as many of them as you possibly can.
The key is having the discernment to know which is the one that you're missing right now.
Right.
And so like the only thing that I'm not sure how to teach is discernment because it's the only thing that allows you to prioritize.
14:44
And so if you see people who are like I said, earlier are moving faster than other people.
It just means that given the resources they have that we all have or equal, which is time.
They're able to with discernment allocate that to the highest skill.
That would be next in the in the stack of skills that they need to learn.
15:00
So my opinion is that if you have twenty five thousand dollars, if you have fifty thousand dollars, if you have a quarter million dollars, if you have 500 thousand dollars in your bank account, I genuinely believe that there is no point to trying to save money.
15:16
If your income is less than two, three, five hundred thousand dollars a year.
I don't think there's a point in, I mean that genuinely and that's not a definitive way.
It's just that saving not going to Starbucks.
To become a millionaire.
Congrats.
You made 40 years and you enjoyed Nothing in life.
15:33
Like now you have a million dollars.
I feel like that's not the I mean is that a life that anyone wanted, right?
Fuck that.
So Hey, if you're a return listener and you have not rated or reviewed the show, I want you to know that you should feel absolutely terrible about yourself and everything else in the world.
15:51
I'm kidding.
But it would mean the absolute world to me.
If you guys would go ahead and do that, you don't have to pause the show, you keep listening and you can just do with your thumb right now will take you less than 60 seconds.
And like I said, the only way that podcast arose through word of mouth and this is you joining hands with me and helping as many isomers with possibly can because no one is coming to save us, it's just us.
16:08
All right, so please go do that now then let's get back to the show.
Thank you.
I'll be here all night until 9:15 where I go to bed.
I'm kidding.
Sorry entrepreneur, add totally, where was I?
16:31
Yeah, so, so exactly.
So my objective for when you should actually consider looking at Investments is when you have so much money coming in that even when you're aggressively searching to find a way to allocate the money to acquire the next skill, there still an excess in abundance that is coming on top of it.
16:53
That is the state that you need to get to went in my opinion.
You have like the Alex stamp of approval.
Not that.
I'm some whatever but I'm just saying like that in my opinion is where It actually starts to make sense.
The next piece of it is that once you have that abundant flow of money, that's coming towards you.
17:13
You also probably have a lot of skills.
And so then looking at investment vehicles of like Bitcoin, the stock market, real estate, you have to also understand because all the things that got you to where you are like I'm petrified of going into real estate because I know that there's guys like me willing to crush me.
17:32
The moment I go in there because No, the game.
And I don't know the rules yet.
And so there is a person in every one of your spaces, who has a talent stack that far surpasses you, and when you need to figure out his deconstruct, look at their path.
So you can figure out what talents they were able to stack together so that they can.
17:48
So they're able to continue to crush you so that eventually you can get strong enough to crush them, right?
And so, It takes so long to get good at the game and the amount of effort.
This is really okay.
I'm trying.
18:04
I wish.
Okay, first off, I did not know that we can have presentation PowerPoints.
I'm a big visual person, so I apologize.
But the amount of effort, the amount of return that you get from learning a new skill.
Goes down with time.
Write your first 20 hours of reading, about sales, your first, 20 hours of sales.
18:24
In general, your first 20 sales consults, you will learn more from zero to then than you ever will in the rest of the career of sales.
But Despite the fact that you have marginal Returns the absolute incremental return, at the end goes up.
18:42
So an example of that would be an Olympic runner, In the beginning and get much faster, much faster, right?
And then as they get better and more advanced and more advanced, they're trying to shave off quarter.
You know, quarter s from their time.
And so, they put months and years to save a half a second on their hundred meter, right?
19:05
Right here, right at the very end.
But what's the difference between first and second, and third?
So the absolute return you get on, the very small incremental return.
You get at the very end, is where all the juices when you're just this much better than everyone else at marketing.
19:24
When you're just this much better than everyone else, that's sales.
When you're just this much better at messaging and strategy, then that's when you go like this.
And so that's why the have these overnight successes and it's usually because they stacked 20 skills, and it was on the 21st skill that the bridge was finally completed, and then it popped up.
19:44
Has anyone heard the story of the bamboo tree?
Okay, one person, fantastic.
So you all be punished for not responding, so So I'm pretty sure there's a Chinese proverb.
Hopefully I'm not butchering it but essentially a bamboo tree so if you if you plant a bamboo tree and you keep it under ground and you look and you wait a whole season and it doesn't seem like it's growing.
20:09
The stubborn farmer will go and dig it up and try and plant it again.
Be like I must have been a bad seed, right?
And the stubborn farmer goes back a year, later must have been a bad seed changes.
The area changes the sunlight changes, the watering changes all of these things constantly, right?
Right.
But the wise farmer knows that he plants it and it takes five years for the the sapling to break the ground.
20:30
And then within the first three months, it's like, 60 feet tall because it's spending the whole time digging down rather than digging up, so that it can have the root system to support the growth and talent.
Stacking works the exact same way.
So I want to make sure that I Is there a direction that you'd want me to take this at all?
20:52
Or is that good?
Or is there a is there like, hey, I'd like to know more about selling shit or like, hey, Yes.
Perfect.
21:10
Yep.
Love it, love it.
Yep, I will.
So he asked an awesome question.
Thank you.
He said, could you give Revenue guidelines for what skills?
You need to acquire a different Revenue levels?
That's a great question.
I wish I had a graph and I could have pondered it more.
But if you're under a hundred thousand dollars a year in your business, I'm assuming you're self-employed, you probably don't have anyone else who's working for you.
21:32
It's probably just you at that point.
Everything is going to be about promotion, right?
You're going to have to know how to Market know how to sell.
So I highly highly highly highly recommend never Outsourcing anything for as long as you possibly can so that you can like I still think I'm probably the best marketer in my business even though I have a whole department and I know how to make adjustments on what they're doing and I also know who's trying to bullshit me.
21:56
Right, I know what ad costs are supposed to be, and the only way that, you know, that is having done it.
The same thing with sales, don't try and hire a sales guy because you're like, well, I'm not good at sales.
Well, then that's always going to be a weak link for you and you're never going to have a good sales.
Team because you don't have the confidence to be able to look back at them in the eye and say like this is wrong, you're not doing it right.
22:15
They're gonna be like well how do you know and you're not going to be able to have the confidence to look back and have an answer and so in the beginning it's all about.
Okay I'm going to pause that.
Does anyone want to have like a hundred million dollar blueprint.
Okay, great.
22:32
So if you want to get to 100 million dollar valuation type company, In my opinion, the way that you have to do it is get really fucking good at one thing.
And this is what David was talking about earlier.
So I wanted to make sure I brought it up.
22:49
And I mean, so good that people start coming to you because of how good you are because our people talk about you, if you don't have that happen, that is the quota for not being good enough.
It means you need to keep doing that thing until you have passed the incremental return, where it starts going like this.
23:08
And in some businesses, that means referrals.
And that's usually what it starts with until you were so good.
At that thing, you do nothing else and it's countered, or your entrepreneurial character to stay disciplined enough.
On this one track because you want to be scatterbrained and Chase the next opportunity and dig up your seed, and start another one, and dig up your seed.
23:26
And start another one.
I'm going to do Fitness for a while.
Actually, I want to be a marketing agency.
Actually, I want to sell a course, actually, I want to do a webinar, you know, affiliate marketing.
Sounds cool sound familiar anyone, right?
If you get so fucking good at any of those things, any one of them you can get 200 million.
23:47
I had a friend who called me.
I'm going to complete that I had a friend who called me from high school and he's got a roofing company.
He was like, yeah you know, we we buy these homes and then we fix them and we flip them.
And I was like, that's awesome, man.
He's like we also do windows.
24:04
I was like, okay, it's like we also do roofs though and that's like really our bread and butter.
And I was like, okay He's like so like you know so this is what I'm thinking we got out and I was like, great so pick one he's like what do you mean?
I was like pick one, like any one of them can be a hundred million dollar business.
24:22
The biggest fallacy that you have is an entrepreneur is that you need more things to make more money when it's the opposite and you less things to make more money and it's the only way you'll make more money when you do less so that you can get better and dig deeper because that's how you're going to be better than everyone else, because the other guys you're competing against are also scatterbrained as fuck right.
24:42
So you can out discipline them by knowing that you're going to dig deep and deep and deep and deep, I can say with a lot of confidence that there aren't too many people who know how to make a gym as profitable as me.
It's been really boring for me for a very long time.
I really understand how to make Jim's profitable, but we stay here and we still keep innovating and figuring out new things because we try and put blinders on.
25:04
So that I don't look at the other opportunities so that we can keep getting better and better and better.
Once you have your one skill, so I'm coming back. once you have your one skill, you can then monetize teaching that skill.
Now, you have a high margin business, that has high value because you really are good at that thing.
25:25
Now, remember it takes years to become good enough.
That people talk about how good you are before you enter the room.
And when you leave people like, dude, that guy's fucking legit.
That's what you want.
If you don't have that, you're not good enough.
In my opinion, everyone wants to start preemptively, but their product isn't strong enough, and then they fizzle because they can't hit the next level because they're actual product isn't strong enough.
25:48
So thanks man, appreciate it.
I thought it was the music.
I was like, I should.
Okay, so you have your first skill.
So you've got your years, right?
We're talking about what Revenue levels.
If you're doing a revenue level, it's awesome.
26:04
That you're like that.
Making money, but you have to just keep doing that thing until you get so good at it that your stock full.
Like, you can't take any more clients and then you raise your prices and then you do it again and then you raise your prices and then you do it again and then you raise your prices and you do it again and you keep doing that until you're the most sought-after.
26:23
At that point, you can then sell that skill that you have acquired, whether you're a videographer, whether you're a graphic designer, whether you're a A salesperson, whether you're a marketer, any of those skills are skills that other people value.
And you can teach people how to do it in a very high margin environment.
26:39
Now, when you have your high margin environment business, it is not a business that has Enterprise Value because it's you, you've just productized, your skill.
Does that make sense?
Which means that after you've taken out the profits from that business and that was should 100% be your objective in that first phase first is skill.
26:59
Acquisition second is Monetization of that skill.
Third is reinvesting, the profits from that high-margin business into a business that does have Enterprise value that does not require you so that could be software.
That could be product, that could be anything.
27:16
Once you have that you use the talent stack, they've acquired up to this point to grow that business, to the point.
That you can then flip it and sell it.
Does that make sense?
That's the hundred million dollar plan or billion, depends how big you play, but that's exactly how you do it.
27:32
If you have no money, which is how I did it.
Well, hold on.
Not that I did it, but I'm saying is like, that's who here has funding, like, for my outside vendor, okay?
Three people.
So, for everybody else who's bootstrapping that was for you, if you have outside money, you can start in different ways, and I think that there's some disadvantages to that as well, because then, there's some talents tax that you skip over that, then you don't know.
27:56
No, you got this jetpack and then you don't know what the missing link is when you get there.
So if you hit a plateau who here has been at a plateau for over a year, Okay, awesome.
28:11
Great.
This is for you right now.
You're not good enough.
You're not good enough and if you can accept that and internalized it, then you can create actions around the thing that you need to do and do over and over and over again.
The actions that you need to take has to be in terms of number of volume and so what I mean by that is if you're like I'm just not that good at sales cool.
28:35
How many consultations can you get into per day?
I'm not that good at marketing.
One of the best things I was ever given was from Ezra Firestone.
If you've ever heard of him, he was at a small event, a private event with me and some other guys.
And he said, I take a percentage a fixed percentage every month of my marketing spend.
28:54
And I spend it on crazy ideas that I have with zero intention of making an Roi.
And he did that, because there was no point in him, trying to learn from other marketers, at that point, because he was above most of the marketers courses that were out there.
It's so the only way that he could learn was by learning in the real world.
29:15
And so each of the skills that you're lacking has a way to do that.
It can be taking more sales.
It can be saying I'm going to always create.
So where's my videographer?
First Nolan somewhere, if I'm Nolan I'm going to thank every single day.
I'm going to make two commercials every day.
29:31
I'm going to make two commercials and every day we're going to run them and I'm going to see which one's did better and what to do, I'm going to deconstruct the ones that did well.
And then I'm gonna try and do more of those until I get so fucking good at it, that every single video that I make is a winner.
And I'm going to keep doing that and it doesn't take a week or a month.
29:49
It usually takes years, right?
That's how it works.
I was on a podcast not that long ago and the host has a slightly younger male audience and he was like, you know, man, I know you always talk about doing the boring work and just like eating shit and like waking up at, you know, midnight.
30:07
He's like and, you know, you totally suffered and we love that.
It's great.
But So for anybody who like, wants that success and wants to just shortcut that, Like what's your advice to them?
And I was like you're not going to like you're you're not going to because you're not going to be good enough.
30:27
Because the guy who did do that and took 4000 101, sales is going to be better.
And one question that Layla and I got at this event a while back was a leading.
The audience said, How are you guys so certain like when you guys talk about your gyms or when you talk about your business, how are you?
30:46
So certain And I think that level of certainty just comes from being, like, I did it for thousand fucking times, like, it's not a lie.
It's not like, I wake up.
I say my affirmations, like I'm a, I'm a gym Guru.
I'm a gym Guru, I'm amazing.
31:01
I'm an expert, you know?
I mean, I'm an expert like I just it kills me.
Because it gets to a point where you've done it so many times that it's not amazing.
It's not fantastic.
You're just stating observations of History.
And when you get to that point, that's when you've probably acquired the level of Mastery, that is required to be able to monetize that skill.
31:27
Does that make sense?
Okay, cool.
So I think I went probably way over.
So anyways, thank you guys.
I'm very honored to be here.
I appreciate you.
Thank you.0:00
What's going on, everybody?
I'm bringing some more books, but I wanted to say that, if you haven't checked out Hunter million-dollar offers, I would definitely suggest that you start there.
I've gotten some solid feedback and it couldn't be happier with its.
Number one ranking on Amazon for direct marketing and over 5,000, five star reviews.
So, thank you guys so much for that.
0:15
It's 164 pages.
I really can help you out.
It takes about four hours to get through, check it out.
On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
The audiobook is Lowe's, they'll let me put it on for it, so I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
Maybe was going everyone.
Had to Sunday.
0:30
Hope you guys are rocking and rolling on your Sunday, morning, evening afternoon, whatever time zone, you are watching or listening to this in.
I recently have been doing a deep dive into funnel world and ads for both B2B and b2c.
I've been kind of like taking a more friends here approached lately.
0:48
And so I wanted to make this because I recently had a gym owner sending some of their ads, and I was like, oh crap, these are deaf and I can convert.
And so I wanted to just give basic headline stuff that will Please just make you more money.
And so the formula that I've used for all of the fitness ads that we ran in that Iran, in my gems that we continue to run is a simple formula is three parts to it.
1:13
All right, the first part is duration, all right, because virtually, every Fitness based promotion that you're gonna run, is going to be x amount of weeks, x, amount of days, whatever, right?
So it's like 21 de 42 day, six week, 28 day. 30 day, one month, whatever that is, that's the first piece of your headline, okay?
1:36
Second piece of the headline.
And this is what I see people mess up is the kind of the benefit or the result.
Okay.
So it'd be like six week, six pack.
If it was four guys, right?
28-day bikini, six-week booty, 42 day detox, like shit, and try to think you can.
1:59
I mean, if you want to even get a The more creative with it, you could say like 28-day skinny friend, right?
So now you're like, then the copy is going to reel it in and talk about how is it, wouldn't it be nice to always be the skinny front, right?
Because now, you're talking about status within the context of other people.
So, you're looking at the prospect within the eyes are from the perspective of the front, right?
2:18
And so you have duration first, okay, in the headline and the second piece that headline is going to be the benefit, all right?
It could be leaning down.
Slim down thin waist.
You know, small dress like that's where like the a lot of really popular.
One was a little black dress, right?
2:35
Because that was the result that was the benefit, right?
And so like like loosen a belt loop like two notches down on the belt loop.
So, try and demonstrate what the result is going to be with the second piece and that's where just being creative as a marketer comes in.
All right, so duration is simple.
Make sure you have a duration first because that's what we wanted to see, what kind of commitment or implied when they're going to achieve the result, right?
2:58
So it's like if you have a 28-day dropped you back, Our dropped your belt notches like cool.
I get it drops you about matches in 28 days.
Cool.
You're not making a guarantee.
That's just the title of the advertisement.
Okay, the third piece to, this is a power word, all right?
3:13
And so a powered could be challenged.
It could be blue print.
It could be accelerator.
It could be intensive.
It could be.
Of course I'll be like, well, in life but it's words like that that are like program.
You don't have mean transformation.
All of those are going to be Be like the the period at the end of the sentence.
3:33
And so when you're making your ads, this is the headline that would go in the banner, all right?
This is the headline that goes in the banner.
Once you've done that, like, if your ad doesn't have that the likely that it's going to convert as much lower period.
It's just like these are.
And what's interesting is they like that sounds so basic.
3:49
Alex, I see ads, all the time from gym owners, you can in our community that don't obey this and then they're surprised that they're not getting results.
Like I made a video a couple days ago about like it's like the news Like, if you look at the way, the headlines, look on the news, they're still the same and they all they do is, they just change the characters.
4:05
And your job is the reporters to go and grab the story and capture it, right?
So duration, 28 day, Benefit, you know, 6.66 duration, 28-day benefit six-pack or, you know, skinny waist, or smaller jean size, or whatever, right?
4:27
And then, blueprint challenge transformation, whatever it is, is the third word.
All right?
And so that is how you go one, two, three.
And that is your formula for headlines.
Now, once you have that, The next piece is going to be the creative.
4:42
I'm not going to get into the creative too much as I've made other videos about that but using the legion scrambler for whatever you want to put in your video or your image is going to work.
Well, right?
So that's going to be group workouts, a pitch, if you explaining what it is going to be any images of people sweating together in the group.
4:59
Together, testimonials work, all of that stuff is creative and you can still use the same headline.
Write the headline doesn't have to be specific to the creative.
So it's like one of the biggest things that I've learned as a marketer, is that you don't need them.
Those two don't actually need to be connected, okay?
I'll tell you where it does need to be connected in a second.
5:15
The next piece that you're going to have to.
This is when you actually go to the copy, some only specifically talked about Facebook ads, if you're marketing, a like gdn or other things in like those, our banners and you have to have more steps to it.
But if you're just talking about Facebook then what you're looking at, then is the first line of the copy is going to be calling it who you want and who you don't want, right?
5:34
Like residents that are in this area, right?
That's what you're like.
There's obviously a compliance guidelines and making sure that you can't.
Say you, when you can't say like you ladies because you can't identify the prospects as face wasn't like that, right?
And you're going to do your best, describe it without calling out the person individually, who's reading, okay.
5:53
So who we're looking for and if not more importantly, who we are not looking for, okay, that can be the first two lines and then you have your subhead right?
Which is going to be tied back to the headline that we said, so it's like if we set the 28-day skinny friends, you know, transformation, Skinny friend, accelerator program.
6:13
Doesn't matter right?
You go there.
It's like wouldn't it be nice to be the skinny friend for once we all have those friends, right?
And that's the lead in, that's the lead into the as like we all have those friends and seems like the guinea whatever they want and they never gain weight.
Would it be nice to know that it's not their genetic to?
It's actually their habits?
6:29
And those habits are programmable and teachable right now I'm like oh this is an interesting ad.
I want to read more.
It's like an over the last X years, implied Authority.
Like we've done this with over 1000 people in this local area alone.
And right now we're opening up our spot or 28-day blah blah blah accelerator.
6:45
And so if you want to be the skinny friend Then click over right and said then call to action.
And so like this is a Formula like, like hopefully just from the way.
I'm describing this.
You can understand how this works.
So when you're making ads and this is what a lot of people are making ads is on Sundays right?
7:03
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads.
I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue.
Tin you to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however, you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
7:22
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
You're making the ads start with the headlines for the actual Banner on the ad itself.
All right, duration benefit, / results, power word, then you have your creative that's going to plug in.
7:42
That's really there just to get attention and make sure that they're like the pause and stop.
All right, a fun side note is make sure that the color makes sense colors and fonts matter, sometimes even more than the words.
So if you're doing a meme Banner or a banner on the ad, you want to make sure that you're not doing Black and Yellow, Yellow or black and red for women, right?
8:02
We're going to be like that looks hardcore, right?
Same thing you don't like stenciled spray lettering which is like kind of like hardcore g.i., Joe lettering for women, right?
It's not going to work as well as a different feel, all right?
To the same extent.
If you're new doing a guys based, add the doing black and green black and blue, like sort of male based colors is going to work fine.
8:22
You shouldn't make sure that your matching those two to the prospect, you're trying to attract.
All right.
And the next thing is like I said is the font, right?
Some fonts work either way.
Like permanent marker is a font on Google fonts works for guys or girls, right?
So you can have white and pink in part in permanent marker, font or you can have black and yellow or black and red or blue and black, whatever it is right.
8:43
Obviously, you can be in the middle and just do blue and white or blue green and red or blue and white or green and white or black, stencil whatever all that stuff's fine, right?
But make sure that you're matching that and these like these are definitely like the fundamentals.
Like these are the basics, but if you're not doing these and you'd be surprised how many people don't Maybe the fundamentals like the advanced people just never don't do them and that's all it is.
9:03
Okay, so we're going back to the edge.
So we've got our headline.
It's in the right font that matches the Prospect and it's in the right colors.
Cool.
We can have our creative, which we know converts it to me.
People working out together, food pictures, you know.
Images of like sweaty selfies.
9:21
I based images were someone's staring at the camera.
Selfie pitch videos.
All of those stipend videos work right for Creative.
Then you have your who you're calling out to to make sure that you both attract the right people.
But Ward away the ones, you don't the not the who it's not for is just as if not more powerful than who it is for, all right?
9:43
Because it shows that you're selected and you're going to be more magnetic and repulsive when you make that, right?
Like, if you notice recently, a lot of the gym watch ads, come out and been like, no personal trainers.
Like we only want gym owners who have over 25 fights or full-time have a signed lease.
And XYZ in the reason for that is because we just did a data analysis on the clients that make the most money with us and stay the longest and guess what?
10:05
It's fucking gym owners, right?
And so, so we're just making sure that we are 100% clear, that that's who we work with.
Now you, if you want to look at your own clients and find out which clients are actually worth the most to you and then put it in your car.
Copy ward off, the people who aren't good and the people who do read that or like, wow, that's really me, right?
10:24
Then they're going to be way more likely to click in the the quality of the click that you get is gonna be much higher.
All right?
And the next thing, finally is the subhead is the lead in, right?
And that's usually going to be tied to the benefit / result, the middle word of your of your, of your headline, right?
10:41
And so if you did, the 28-day lose, two notches, whatever transformation, right?
And this is where you have.
Little image of jeans and a belt or something on the banner, right?
Would make sense.
And then when you're with the lead in is going to tie it back to that because like how is this connected?
10:57
And so you're going to connect that to like, hey have you ever have you ever have you noticed recently that you keep going up and notches every six months or so?
Well, good news is it's not permanent and we know how to fix it, right?
And then you're like boom then you can go to your normal copy, okay?
So if you are making your ads, make sure to use those headlines, make sure that the Banners are set that way.
11:18
Three pieces, duration benefits, election results, and then power word, make sure that if the images flash copy our attention, grabbing usually like the legion Scrambler, like just use that.
And then when you are doing the copy on the top, make sure you're attracting and repulsing the right people and then do your lead in your sub headline, or what would be your sub headline, because you don't want that.
11:41
Actually actual better.
It's too many words, but you want that subhead?
Because if they read that, then they're going to want to find out more.
They find out more than it's going to.
Hide what they just read and it's going to be relevant.
All right?
Once they click from there to the page, you want it to be congruent, all right?
11:57
So if you're having a 28-day, blah, blah, blah, and this is where it's like, this is where it takes work.
This is where like good marketers.
Be mediocre marketers just by not being lazy and so then they make sure the page matches the offer and the benefits and the results that we're talking on the ad because people clicked, it's exactly what they want.
12:14
All right, and so that's what we're doing here, you can have two is that are running for the same campaign, just once for men and one for women.
That's a basic split, right?
If you want to get more granular, you can have older women and younger women.
I would imagine that you probably talked to a 55 year old women differently.
Talk to a 25 year old girl, right.
12:30
Of course you would write the messaging changes the way that the page probably looks different etcetera and so that's where you become a better marketer.
So anyways I hope that just gives you just like a quick overview in terms of gloss if you're making your acid aches that Sunday which is what a lot of our gym owners do make their ads.
Follow those guidelines, you'll get more clicks.
12:48
She'll get more leads.
And if you found this valuable tag, somebody drop a, like, or comment.
And if you're listening on the podcast, please leave.
All right.
Keep being awesome.
Lots of love you guys.0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
Friday, I'm giving you Friday.
Day night, content, P section.
We'll go back in here since connections better.
Anyways, I want I called this get over it, but it was, because Leo and I were having this conversation and it was basically that all of the gyms that, you know, we've seen and we've worked with over a long time and not even just gyms, just people who've been Marketing Online for awhile.
0:50
Complain about the same thing, right?
They complain about the same things, like, man, Facebook's not as cheap as it used to be.
And I wanted to make this one video because I think it's incredibly important.
Like you just need to get over it.
You just need to get over it.
Like it's never going to be as cheap as it was and guess what?
1:07
It's never going to be as cheap as it is today because tomorrow it's going to be more expensive.
And so like you can either continually whine and complain about things that you cannot control.
Or you can accept the fact that it's a Marketplace, it's an auction and it will continue to rise.
And if you look at Google and you look at history whenever new platforms open up their widely.
1:26
Underpriced attention in eyeballs and so you can make a massive killing Even if you suck it business and the reality is that a lot of people who got in on this game, early sucked it business, but they just happen to be in on it early and so they could make money on Penny clicks because it's not hard to make money on Penny clicks, right?
1:44
But when you have ten dollar clicks, all of a sudden the game changes because you have to make a hundred times more money, right?
Or whatever.
The math is a thousand times, whatever it is, right?
And so right now, if you're like man, I wish I wish Facebook ads were cheaper.
Man I wish leads were cheaper what you need to focus?
2:00
On is what you can actually control, which is the monetization of the customer, right?
We've been able to continually spend four years for six straight years.
I've tried to outspend everyone in every Market I've ever been in.
Whether it was an intellectual space or was a local geography.
And the reason we've been able to do is because we focus on how much the lifetime value of the customer was because that was under our control.
2:20
And so right now, if at your gym, you're only selling workouts and you have no other ways of monetizing a customer then you are losing out.
Because the thing is, is that the water is going to rise, right?
Your ability to see spend money and capture leads and by attention.
And by eyeballs is going to continually go down, so get the fuck over it right?
2:37
Stop whining.
It's not going to get better, right?
And so like it's like, I just I'm being purposely harsh because it's you just need to accept that.
That's the reality that we live in.
And if you want things to improve, like, if you want things to improve, like, you're just, what is it Wishing on a Star or whatever it is.
2:55
And what I will say is, if you can remind yourself right now.
The feeling that you have of like me I wish I had spent more when it was cheap, right?
Remember that because that is when the next thing that comes along, you need to double down and believe it or not.
You still need a double down on Facebook ads.
3:11
Why?
Because it's still cheaper today than it's going to be tomorrow and it's still the best price stuff.
Best priced attention, that's out there from a targeted standpoint, right?
So like if you think about a big picture, like if I can get a five, to one return on something today and I could get a 20 to 1 return on that.
3:28
Same thing, two years ago.
Is it still a good investment today?
Yes.
Is it as good?
No.
What's my alternative shrugging?
Right and so what your focus on is a business should be always improving your mouse trap.
Should always be improving the actual business so that you can buy and afford eyeballs on any platform independent of the maturity level.
3:47
If the only game that you can play is for Penny clicks.
It means you're going to be a penny stock type business owner, right?
You're not going to be able to play with the big boys.
You can't play with the beaut blue-chip, guys.
Most of those guys wait for.
Ideas for ten years before platform even matures before.
4:02
They're like, okay, we're going to get into this, because they're in boardrooms, and they're like, we're not sure if it's worth putting the attention towards opening this new platform.
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
4:21
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, Right?
And so, like, so like right now, if you could only survive in that environment, it's because your business sucked, right?
4:39
If you could only do lbos and only afford getting leads 43 dollars and if it was more than $3, you only have ten dollar leads and at $10, you priced out, you have Shady business or you don't know how to do math.
It's one of the two, right?
And so you have to be less emotional, you have to be able to let your math do the dictation, right?
4:55
Like, this isn't me soft toss and you know what we have?
But like, if you have a diagnostic selling process and you're selling, what kind of buildings On top of it, you can sell your membership for $425 a month.
How do I know that?
Because we're all doing it.
And Jim lunch, can you get a thousand dollars up front on average, upfront ticket.
5:11
Yes.
Do you think that would help you in your acquisition costs?
Probably if your business isn't doing that?
Is that going to be?
Are you going to be beat down by someone else who can yes?
Why math, right?
Because they can continue to play right?
And so when the sandbox are you know, gets filled or when the level of the water rises and only the best players stay because they can keep swimming because they spent the time to build the mouse trap that built the highwomen Highest lifetime value per customer because they were in the end providing the most value.
5:37
Those are the guys that are continuing to stay and continue to play and so if the objective of the game is to keep playing the game is to stay in the game and not quit.
Then you need to look at your business and think, how can I make these customers more valuable me and by extension, what do I need to do for them in order to make them more valuable?
5:55
All right, and that's where you need to add the intangibles because if you're only selling workouts, you're only selling your quote Community.
Guess what?
Take a ticket.
So is everybody else?
Right?
So if you want to stand out so that you can provide more value.
Look at the things that like, I mean, look at what we're doing.
You know what I mean?
Like, this is free content, you know, I mean, look at what we're doing.
6:13
So what I want to kind of build e, so what I want to trician, sell it in a duration based play.
So some on two goals on for 40 weeks, upfront paid in full, right?
That's how you're gonna sell big ticket and that's how if one out of five people who walks in your door is going to buy a three thousand dollar thing.
For me, that means that per show up you're making $500 per show, right?
6:30
And if you know that you're getting one out of three, Eads in the door to show, that means you can spend 150 $200 a lead and still break even on the acquisition and still have the lifetime value of the customer to collect.
And so, if you don't have that, you're just going to get beat by someone who does because they're going to be able to continue to stay in play and then you're going to be looking around be like whoa, whoa, Facebook us don't work anymore.
6:50
All the out platform doesn't work anymore.
Believe it or not.
This story has already happened, right?
Like before this, it was direct mail before that.
Sorry, before this was Google before, that was direct mail before that was newspaper ads.
Like it just kidding before.
That was Logs like it just kept going back and back and back.
And so if you just a student history when one of these things open up, pound it drive it.
7:10
As hard as you possibly can ride that thing, right?
And you honestly should still write it and if you can't right now because your business sucks, all right, it's because you haven't figured out a way to monetize your customers, probably, right.
It means you're not providing enough value.
So instead of lamenting instead of complaining, instead of being upset, instead of stopping your feet and pouting and be like, what it does work anymore, Do what you can control figure out, how you can find more value, your customers, figure out how you can make more money, more money up front from the people who walk in your door so you can liquidate acquisition costs so that you can continue to stay and pay.
7:44
And hopefully, if your goal is to help people over a long period of time to build something that lasts, it's a game you're going to have to conquer anyways, and the platform doesn't matter where you buy eyeballs, doesn't matter, whether it's Facebook, whether it's Google, whether it's YouTube, whether it's whatever, it doesn't matter.
The only thing that matters is your mouse trap and if the mousetrap is right, right?
8:02
You can buy whatever you want for as long as you want.
So, anyways, hope you guys have an amazing Friday and this was a late night, post if you can drop it, like, drop a comment, try the smiley face, drop an emoji.
And if you're listening at home, or in the car on podcast, proper review, always appreciate those.
Anyways, have an amazing day and hope you guys crush your dreams.
8:17
All right, ah,0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the gym.
His Secrets podcast, my name is Alex and I will be your host on this awesome Journey.
So today we're going to be talking about something that I like to call affection, leave him and the garlic, which is a story and the sold me.
0:41
My business Mentor that really impacted how I saw client Ascension and how you create the customers that you want.
So, a lot of times I'll talk to you personal trainers and gym owners and they're like, you know what?
I just I just want to be able to have, you know, 10 people a month that sign up for my Thousand dollar month, personal training program, and the reality is that there aren't that many of those people and what it takes to get them is not you need to create those types of customers rather than try and find them.
1:17
It's much easier to make them.
And so the easiest example is even like our highest and coaching program is over six figures, right?
And so in order for I can't go up to somebody on the street.
Peter knock on a gym or assembly.
Hey, give me 100 Grand, right?
1:33
I can't do that.
But in time people learn to trust us.
Trust us enough.
That they're like, I want to do that, right?
And so we've created that customer and so you have to do the same thing with your business.
Now, here's the explanation.
1:50
Was how the ham and the garlic plays into this.
So a little boy, Was was, you know, playing with the dog.
And he realized that there was all these ticks on the dog, dog at all.
These takes on it.
So he goes to his grandmother, he's like, everyone, there's all these texts.
2:06
He's like, if I keep taking the takes off, he's like, but they keep coming back on and so, they're almost like you have to, you have to give the dogs and garlic, and then it will sweat it out.
And of course, the dog tries to consider the kid tries to give the dog garlic and I was like, nah, I don't want to go, right?
2:26
And she was like, Mijo.
This is Hispanic story.
Like wrap it in some ham and then give it to the dog.
So you're upsetting him and the dog eats it.
And then the next day you see, is that all the ticks are crawling up the wall because you know, the dog sweating out the garlic and it takes the whole don't like it.
2:43
Now the point of that story is not the like feature clients hands.
Eames and sandwiches with garlic in them, but it's to wrap what they need, which is the garlic with what they want, which is the ham and so this kind of feet a little bit into.
2:59
I'm trying to make this full circle, but when you're attracting customers, a lot of times you're like, I just want someone who's going to be a powerlifter who we just wants to follow, macros and follow pure dies plan or whatever you want to say, right?
But that's not where most people are because the widest base where most people are, is the beginners, right?
3:17
And then after that, Much much smaller piece of meteor, intermediates and then beyond that, I'm much much, much more peace are Advanced, and it's much easier to take a beginner and have a systematic process of a sending them up an awareness.
So that they understand, they learned the educate.
3:34
They will also value you a lot more and what your services because they will see the process.
They've gone from beginning, all the way to end where you are, right?
The question is, how can you do that?
And that's where the ham and the garlic comes into play.
3:50
If you see the ham ass, A weight loss challenge or flat buns or, you know, our flat abs and buns and guns, whatever.
Like the little, The Hokey names that, that we know that convert and some gym owners are like, I can't believe.
I would never say that.
4:05
They're like purist but the same times they didn't see bank accounts.
And so, I would say, give the people what they want because, you know, for us, we had, we had a booty program, right?
We got a big booty boot camp.
What was it, really?
It was a six-week Squat and deadlift seminar and that's all we did.
4:22
Was we would do.
Every single variation squats and Ellis you can possibly imagine, right?
So the training was on point but if I had marketed it as a squat and deadlift seminar, ain't nobody gonna buy it, right?
But when I did a big booty boot camp, I had 40% of my customer, take me up on it and so the reality is that you need to wrap.
4:43
The garlic in this case, you know, lifting or following macros or whatever, with the ham, which is a really, you know, commercial, you know, whatever whatever you want to call it, name to get them in the door and it's weird to get them to buy it.
5:00
And the same thing with your front and offers, some people like don't like saying, they want to run a weight loss challenge.
Well, I don't believe in weight loss term so what your prospects do and What you need to do is get them in the door, so that over time you can explain to them the difference.
5:18
But a lot of us take this like, pridefully ghost dancers are, well, they don't know the difference and I don't want.
Yes, there was a time when you didn't know the difference either, right?
And so we have to let our pride get out of it.
Meet people where they're at and then systematically, educate them and a send them in their awareness level such that they Now understand and can actually even laugh and look back at how they used to think about exercise and Fitness.
5:44
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
5:59
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I push the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
And I'm saying this works in all businesses, not just gyms, but even like within my business because I'm actually not in the weight loss business, I'm in the business coaching business, right?
6:22
And so for me, I we get we get all of our clients in with Jim hunt which is just it makes them a bunch of cash really quickly, right?
But the reality is that what they really need is they need to actually improve their service and have systematic ways of retaining customers and descending customers too much higher ticket prices, right?
6:43
But I can't give that up front because they're so in there in such danger zone, says, danger modes of scarcity, that they're like, I can't, they need something that's going to make money immediately requires no thought.
They push a button and money comes in, right?
So we solve that problem for them, but then we say, hey, come over here, come over here and check this out.
7:01
This is what you really need.
This is the macros and listing.
Like we gave you the low-carb diet to start to turn a mean and they lost their water weight, real fast.
But we really need you to do is this and this is the Person lifting plan, but this one takes a little bit longer, but once it's done, it's done.
7:17
You don't have to worry about your gym anymore.
It'll create money on, autopilot the way you want it to, and every month, your bills automatically paid and, you know exactly how much is left over.
And you don't have to be there every day and it'll grow without you.
That's what everyone wants, but that doesn't happen overnight.
7:36
You can't get cash over in it, which is what a lot of them do need.
So we fix that first, so we can get them out and then increase their awareness level.
So They can see what's going on in their business and then we can send them to the next level, all right?
So hopefully, this would make sense for you think about this, in terms of how you're offering your friend and approach promotions, how you get people in the door and then how you would send people through your services and don't ever think that you're too good to offer.
8:02
Like you have to meet people where they're at and if you want to help lots of people which hopefully you do, then you need to meet people at the very base base base level of awareness, which For a lot of people is like Jenny Craig, my doing Weight Watchers.
8:17
Am I doing a point system?
You know, I mean, that my, my doing lokar my doing, hi, Carmine doing lots of cardio is like, they don't know.
It's you got to teach him, right?
So anyways, lots of love everyone.
Hope this was useful for you and thinking about your offers, this is something that's very profound for me.
8:33
Now is remember the story of the ham and the garlic because you got to give them what they want in order to be able to give them what they need.
Alright and if this is your first time listening or maybe maybe it's not you like to hear how we get Jim's from zero to full capacity in 30 days.
8:49
We have a beautiful case study for you.
We have four of them actually to go to gym launch.
Secrets.com Ford slash Quiz.
We will give them to you.
You can often with this tree mail and if you feel super frisky, you can apply on the next page for a free call where we do not take any any form of payment on any first calls and it's because we don't want you to feel pressured with anything.
9:14
So, yeah, hope that was useful for you and I'll see you guys.








0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
Good morning everyone.
Happy Thursday.
Hope you are.
Having an excellent beginning.
Ting to your Thursday or whatever day you are listening to this.
I wanted to talk about a different subject today that I realized I get like this emotional reaction when I see stuff all over the Instagram and the social media, and its kind of one quote, which you may have heard people say which is no one will outwork me.
0:52
I'll never let anyone out work.
And I have such a fundamental issue with this.
And I did, I was like, I didn't realize how much it bothered me until Like, I had like, two or three people in a row that I saw, right?
This on their Instagram.
Like, no, not work me.
I want work.
Anyone and just bugged the crap out of me.
1:09
And so I was like, why does this bug make?
And I think that I hate absolutes in general and it's because like when you say that you fundamentally admitting that, you have no idea whatever like you have no idea what ever else in the world is doing and so saying that, no one else will outwork you.
1:25
I just think is like stupid.
That's just that's just like, no disrespect.
Anyone who said it, it's just like for me, like maybe you're saying it to yourself because you want to say to yourself, but to say it publicly seems odd to me.
And so, like just as a basic outline like, Jack ma who basically runs China's version of Amazon.
1:46
Like in his company, it's very standard to run a 996.
Meaning you work from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. six days a week, right?
That is the standard that is par, for course, right?
And I can tell you that, fucking 90% of Americans that I even see.
Doing that are working 50 hours a week, right?
2:03
And they're saying, no one will outwork me.
Like your your best is China's standard is just is normal, like no one's eat.
Like, no one's even getting like clapping their hands.
They're just like, this is just what we do, right?
Which kind of brings me to another point, which is, I think that a lot of times, we massively underestimate how much our capacity is.
2:27
And so when I see people say like, no one will outwork me.
And And I see them even take a single vacation.
I'm like there's somebody who is not taking a vacation right now who is out working, so please don't say that right?
Like, it's like in my opinion it should be like, no one will out sacrifice me?
2:43
No one will give up more than me for my goal, right?
No one will put more things on this altar to the, to the altar of sacrifice, for my goal, then I will, and I think that's a more realistic way to do it.
Now, what happens is it starts to get really ugly When you start really thinking about it, it's like, well, I sacrifice my marriage.
3:04
Well, I sacrifice my kids, my relationship with my kids.
Well, I sacrifice my health, right?
There are all these things that we put on the altar because the thing is, is if you say no one will outwork you, that means that there's somebody out there and they're fucking is, who will put their marriage, who will put their kids relationship, who will put their health on the altar, to achieve what they want.
3:25
Alright, and if you're not doing that then no, you're not out working though, right?
And so, just Don't say that.
Okay, now, I'm not saying you should, I'm seeing should be cognizant of what you're trying to make your goal to be, all right?
And so, the next kind of Point here is that most people who really work the most don't even think about it.
3:46
They don't even consider it work, right?
And so, the difference is so I talked to dr.
Kashi about this all the time because he worked with so many champions and so many Olympians and whatnot, he's like the, the difference between Olympians and champions and everyone else is not Like everyone looks at them and says, what do they have that?
4:02
I don't have.
He's like, when in reality is what do I have that?
They don't have it, what it means is they lack something, they lack and off switch, they lacked a constraint, right?
It's like we all have the same engine, they don't have brakes.
4:18
That is the difference.
And so the reality is that the people who are the champions typically have pathology that goes along with that, which means that they have Civ personalities.
They have massive issues because they cannot stop.
4:35
They don't even perceive time.
They don't perceive work or the concept of work.
And so, every time that you are willing yourself and making that motivational poster yourself to say, I'm still working, no one will outwork me.
They don't give a shit because they're working and they're not even thinking about it, right?
4:50
And so while you're like you're like yeah they're just doing still right there, still working nine to nine six days a week in China not even thinking about About what we're doing because that's just normal there, right?
And so, one of the things that I said really early on in my career because things started going well with the gym and people would ask me.
5:11
They're like, so you doing like, like how does it work and how they're growing all that stuff?
And I remember, I always used to respond with the same thing that I haven't sent in a while which is like you'd be amazed at what you can accomplish when you have no choice.
And people are like, how are you working so many hours, right?
5:26
Because I was, I mean, I was, I was up at 3:00 and I was going to bed at 11 and I did that for probably a six month period in the beginning.
And I was like, I wasn't showering, I wasn't working out.
Like, it was very hard for me.
And I was, I just all I could remember thinking, and I hope this doesn't offend anyone.
And if you are offended, then I apologize.
5:43
But like, I kept thinking about the most vicious atrocities of humanity in this really actually motivated me.
Because I don't, I try not to think that I'm better than anyone, but I try to think that I'm just as good as anybody else, right?
And so, if I saw that back in the days of slavery, there were like, everyone got a few hours off on Sunday or whatever.
6:06
And they were working all day long, physically manual labor.
And that was an entire.
It was Sue's generations of this level of work and level of effort.
And the thing is is that you'd be amazed at what you can accomplish when you have no choice.
There was no choice.
The choice was worker died, right?
6:23
And so, what's interesting is that we actually have the same choice, right work?
Weird, I grow or die because the thing is, is that the, the alternative is usually not accomplishing our dreams, right?
And a lot of times that can feel like death, obviously, it was much more obvious in those situations in the past and probably much harder.
6:43
But the reality is that like the choice is still ours.
You know what I mean?
And when I see that so People were able to work at that level.
It means that that level of work is possible.
It's just whether you have the discipline to pursue that and more, so the willingness to sacrifice things that other people aren't willing to sacrifice.
7:01
And so, hey guys, real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans, I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 leads but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks.
7:19
Talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers, make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
Its fo free in exchange for your email so that I can email you when we launched under the real leads.
And so that you can not miss out on it because last time I sold out for like eight straight weeks really fast.
7:35
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
To bring this to bring this full loop of like, well, like why can't say no one's going to outwork me?
Like, what do I say?
How do I make the go?
Like, hey, I'm not saying I'm some on some, I know the answer here.
7:51
I'm purposely saying that I hate that saying, because there's a, there's no way you know, anyone else, like that of the 7 billion people.
That's right.
No one will outwork, you know, right.
Even the people who don't even know they're working, even the people in labor camps, like, no one will outwork you.
8:09
I just think it's It's ill-informed or you're just saying it to make an impression, but the real real is, it might be better to think.
No one will out sacrifice now, that's where you get into issues because, like, maybe there are things that you don't want to give up.
8:26
And so then in that case, it's like well then maybe you just don't say that.
Maybe you just try and do the best with what you have and do it within the confines of what you want and what you're willing to trade to be successful, right?
Maybe you're not willing to trade your marriage.
There is someone who is willing to take their marriage to be more successful.
8:42
Right there is someone who will trade their relation with the kids to be more successful.
You see it all the time.
There are people willing to do it, right?
And they're probably some people listening who are willing to do or are already doing, right?
And so, like just just be mindful of that.
And so the last piece is like What is maybe the better frame right because you can work all day right.
9:04
You can work 996 right 92. 96 days a week and maybe take a half day off on Sunday or whatever.
Right.
You can work that way.
But the thing is is are you moving forward, right?
So I know, I know there are, I know there are trainers right now who still work 12 hours a day training sessions, but they're not moving forward and so they might say no one will outwork me, but I would bet that their goal is not to work hard.
9:27
Their goal is probably To accomplish something or level up, right?
And so, I think it might be better to think.
No one will outpace me, right?
Or no one will out.
Learn me, right?
No one will outgrow me and because those are things that are much more on your mental constraints and take more.
9:45
Emotional work than simply adding hours to your day, right?
Anyone can just be awake and work, alright?
Actually, maybe not anyone, but I think a lot of people can just work, like it's not that hard.
Hard shit.
All of us, do it all the time and when I see something that everyone can do for a lot of time, I don't see that it's hard.
10:06
Okay, but what a lot of people can't do is they can't get uncomfortable.
They can't go into the emotional places admitting deficits.
They can't say where they suck.
They can't say where they're not willing to sacrifice.
They can't admit the things that they are ashamed of in terms of and it doesn't need to necessarily be emotional stuff.
10:22
It could be like stuff that they're ashamed of that.
Like like I'm not good at delegating I suck at I suck it.
My remembering things I suck at being organized.
I suck at staying focused.
I have entrepreneurial add that's just who I am.
Like whenever you say to yourself that's just who I am.
Just just hear yourself speak over your own limits, right?
10:42
Just remember you're like cool.
I just created a nice jail cell for myself, right?
Because that's just who I am.
It's like, well, good luck breaking that, right?
And so maybe if your goal is to achieve what you want, then think in terms of sacrifices think, in terms of the things that you're willing to give up and then also think in terms of the things, You're willing to outgrow right?
11:00
Think about the mental limits and the at all.
The things that you think you believe about yourself that actually aren't true are things that you're carrying from your parents or things that you're carrying from.
Your siblings is things that you're carrying from your teacher, who said something to you, when you were kid and that you just believe to be true because you didn't know any better, right?
11:16
And the reality is that like we make ourselves, we are all self-made.
And so I like my, my I implore you to self-examine and realize that the identity is entirely fluid itself.
Created.
We make our own identities.
And so if you want to achieve what you want to achieve, it's typically because there's something that you are telling yourself.
11:35
That is not true that you choose to believe.
And so if you want to get what you want, I think that it might be more productive instead of making Instagram post about hearing how you're not going to, how no one will not work.
You how you're going to work harder than anyone, maybe put it in a different way which is like I'm going to try and outgrow myself.
11:56
I'm going to try it out Pace myself because Those are the only things that you have any control over, which is what you do, and how you perceive yourself and the stories that you tell yourself to either, Propel you forward or get in your way.
So anyways, hope that maybe resonated with someone.
12:14
If you are trying to work hard that I totally respect the shit out of you.
Keep grinding, figure out if you have the things.
If you if there, if there are things that you want to sacrifice that, you are not sacrificing that you should be.
And I think something that is always It's useful to remember, is that, it's amazing.
12:30
What you can accomplish when you have no choice.
And so, if you're in a hard spot right now and things are difficult, I can tell you that you are in the you're in the makings of an environment where you can prove to yourself.
The things that you didn't think you were capable of, because you have no choice, but to succeed and move forward.
12:46
So if you are in a dark time, then use that.
As a way to tell your own story, a story that you're going to be able to continually tell yourself over the years that you will be able to use and reinforce your newer identity, the identity that you want.
That's going to help you accomplish what you want in life.
So you guys have an amazing day.
13:02
Have an amazing Thursday.
Hope you guys crush your goals and I'll catch you guys on the flip side, alright, drop a like or comment or review if you're listening at home or in the car, whatever.

So you guys have an amazing day.
Have an amazing Thursday.
Hope you guys crush your goals and I'll catch you guys on the flip side, alright, drop a like or comment or review if you're listening at home or in the car, whatever.
All right, be easy.0:00
Hey guys, love that.

You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.

0:19
Happy Friday.
Hope you guys are crushing your goals and having an amazing start to your day.
I wanted to bring something up that.
I got a question from the sales team, looping back around but they You got a couple times so I wanted to address it and I would imagine that you might want the answer to.
0:35
It is also a really good kind of like looking in the past case study that you can learn from The Good, the Bad, the Ugly, everything that I learned.
So I'm calling this, you know what happened, a hybrid I might change the title to like why it's not talking about hybrid.
But basically so hybrid for those of you don't know, was essentially having nutrition and accountability 101 for people who walk into the facility.
0:57
Right.
This isn't a really far and concept I just Name on it because I like branding things to make them new and different.
So that is a good thing most times now.
Once we started marketing aggressively for hybrid, what happened was, there was there's an online component to it right in a remote component because you could in theory, just train, someone for nutrition and pull them accountable to that and they wouldn't even necessarily need to go to the gym, right?
1:22
I mean, this is what Weight Watchers has done.
This is what Jenny Craig is done.
This is what tons of weight loss centers Across America for, you know, decades have been doing right?
And so simply adding this on top but having the personal training anchor because they're coming into a gym allows us to charge much more for it, okay?
Now, That is that is that is hybrid in a nutshell, right.
1:41
The reason I stopped talking about it was because I honestly had a huge Revolt within my community of people who thought I still.
I no longer wanted to work with Jim's, right?
And so that was kind of on the internal side.
So people were like, you don't want to search Jim's anymore and I was like, no.
I'm just saying like this is a more profitable service and it doesn't require as much square footage and you can make more profit like that was kind of the whole argument but they're like, no, you don't want that.
2:03
And so anyway, I think part of that was cherry-picking like one or two sentences and then like not The whole story.
That's okay, you know.
I mean it happens and it's a good lesson for me because I have to now I learned how much one headline or one hook matters and I and David Ogilvy who's a great advertisers, like no Prospect every ad has to contain the full concept of a product because consumers don't consume advertising in series, they only really consume one add right.
2:35
Like they don't remember your advertisements like you do.
Right?
And so that was a huge lesson for me.
And so what I shifted towards you may have heard me talking about it, is I just now, say 101 attrition and accountability, rather than hybrid.
And it was because when I said hybrid, it had tied to it the online component.
2:54
So, when I say internally, I had some gym shoe thought that I no longer wanted to serve gyms, which is crazy to me, because literally always service gym owners, that's okay.
It was my mistake externally when I had any kind of mentions of And it attracted a lot of trash.
3:10
It brought a lot of Watcher preneur Z brought a lot of people who were dabbling, who wanted a side, hustle laptop lifestyle like that type of person into our business and it was horrible, Oh, by and large.
Now that being said there, you know, obviously, so tons of people who are successful with it, it's just that the people who were successful with it, we're a gym owners.
3:31
Not people who could have a gym or could have done this Etc.
Obviously, we Have people who were but if I'm looking at bigger percentages they weren't and so we did this as a 90-day run.
So we did it from June until end of September where we were marketing it.
3:48
I think we might even ended halfway through September in terms of the marketing externally.
And by doing that we just saw that the people we had more sales and we never have to do it so much, so much in doubt, so much inquiries, right.
The quad of the prospect was lower.
4:04
And so when we looked at after 90 days, whoo, So with us, right?
And who had been successful, it was literally just gym owners.
I mean, there were obviously Petey's and things like that that were successful, but the vast majority were gym owners and specifically gym, owner that over had over 25 clients, they were full-time gym owners.
4:22
They had releases, they have employees so like real business owners, right?
And so once we saw that we totally change the messaging externally and so I change the messaging internally to one on nutrition and accountability.
So people wouldn't freak out about a thing, a new thing.
And what ends up happening, as well as that a lot of the things that we had were like, well, I know that this is a better model, but I'm kind of tied to my lease already.
4:43
So I can't really change that aspect of the overhead and are like already have enough people in large group.
So I'm just going to kind of keep that.
And so, that is what when we combine with the diagnostic sale, as in taking large grouping, adding the 101 attrition and accountability on top of it made it really easy for everyone to understand it made it real.
5:03
There was no beliefs I had to break about adding nutrition accountability to an existing.
It's like a room is okay with that.
And so what it ended up doing is allowing us to have four hundred dollars plus per month, you know, for large group and so that was ultimately kind of the easier way of explaining it.
5:18
And so this is, I think this is a great like, I mean, it's it was a huge learning experience for me.
But for you if you're taking this and listening like okay, if I'm going to communicate change, one is always understanding that.
No one likes change.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, one likes, change, employees don't like change clients don't like change.
5:37
JH.
Your mother doesn't like change.
No one likes change, right?
And so it was a huge lesson for me, in terms of messaging, right?
Like so if I could do it all over again, I wouldn't have called it hybrid.
I would not have said any, I would never said the word online.
5:52
Dear God.
Just the amount of trash that you get in from.
That was ridiculous.
I would have, simply said, take your large group at this on top, make more money, separate yourself and don't sell workouts.
All Emo's a nation quick break.
6:10
Just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright.
So send me a connection request.
A note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
6:29
That's what I would have said.
And it would have probably gone over way smoother than it.
Did internally and externally, I wouldn't have had all the trash that came in because that's just kind of crushes more out for the team where they have people not showing for calls.
They have, you know, people who are non-starters, who like, you know, they're three weeks in and they're like, hey, we're like, we're like, dude where you're like, why haven't you launch your ad yet?
6:49
No, I haven't logged in the poorly at, like, what you doing?
You know what I mean?
So real business owners, do much better with us because we are real business owners and real business.
Owners also have like real expectations in terms of understanding.
7:04
How like, yes, if you're going to sell for 4 hours a day, it's going to take four hours, right?
It's like, what can I do this for an hour to?
Like, people think that online means you don't work, right?
I can tell you, I have an online business.
I fucking work, right?
And so it was kind of just bringing in the wrong type of people.
7:21
So that's why I said, I'd stop talking about that way.
Externally and why I call it when I want attrition accountability internally now as well.
And in the marketing.
So whenever I say what I want attrition and accountability, it's me saying hybrid really fast just without the marketing spin on it, but all of these things were really necessary though for us to get to where we are now.
7:41
And so that's kind of like the pros and cons of innovation, right?
And so we needed to, I mean I needed I needed to feel that way.
I found out another way not to do something and luckily it was a 90-day Sprint, we learned and then we adapted.
7:57
And so what What came from that was the combination of the diagnostic sale, which is the probably, the single greatest fundamental change that we've had in gym watching the last year to the model, right?
8:13
And, and it took the components of hybrid and took the best components of the gym.
And just made it easy for everyone to understand, easy for them to differentiate from their competitors, easier for them, to provide more value, to the end user, and ultimately make more money, right.
And so now, when someone walks in the door at one of our gyms, they walk in, and it doesn't matter what promotion their marketing, whether it's a 28-day, a six-week a 42-day, a 12-week, a 21 day, it doesn't matter, right?
8:40
Seven-day it all is irrelevant because when that person walks in the door, we're going to sell to go.
We're going to sell to their goals, so we can actually solve the problem, right?
Because we can all agree.
When that person comes in that ten days, ain't gonna solve ship, right.
And you can usually get most people to agree with that.
8:58
That pretty easily.
And so once we take them through a diagnostic selling process, we can say, let me solve your problem.
It's going to take this amount of time and by the end of this period of time, you won't need me anymore, right?
And if you choose to stay, it's because you want to stay for the community and that's awesome.
But like, you will not, you will be able to have cake, you'll be able to count your Macros.
9:14
You're going to know how to train by the end of this period of time, so that you can keep this off for life and actually enjoy the process, right?
And so, I think so many more gems got on board with that because they, because I mean, just like anyone, like we just want to solve people's problems, and we just happen to have Vehicle of large group workouts, right?
9:29
It's like okay you know, when my mom who's 60 comes in like she really shouldn't do boot camp right?
She's got a bad hit.
Like she, you know, I mean she shouldn't do that but she would let it would be great for her to have help with nutrition accountability and just walk every day.
And then over time, if she, if she gets in shape enough and she gets the confidence to come in the gym, she can do that, right?
9:46
But if someone is able to do the workouts, then it also allows you to really work on the 95% that's going to drive the results, which is the right.
And actually, making sure they show up and what's interesting is that people actually value that a much higher.
A level right people value, someone falling up them everyday and helping them with their food more than they value workouts.
10:04
We know that, because, you know, the big chains are coming in and doing group workouts for 49 bucks a month unlimited.
So, it's like, if you want to differentiate from that you have to find more ways to provide more personalization more service, right?
And so instead of necessarily eliminating your large group, you can just keep the larger.
10:20
The way it is Bolt this on, on top to your existing membership base overnight at ten fifteen thousand, dollars a month recurring with, basically almost all margin.
And then on the front end, you can sell people into 5 K for K 3 K packages for large group which I mean is pretty unheard of.
10:36
And so that's that was the biggest fundamental change that we had in the business model that's what allows us to now get to you only need 180 if T's to get to a million dollar run rate, which if you have eight percent attrition takes 12 months.
If you start at zero if you start at.
And that's with only 100 leads a month.
So you know if you 5% of shit you can hit it in like seven months or something that I can remember the math but like Like it's very fast because each client's $425 a month, right?
11:02
And so, if you were wondering what happened to hybrid hybrid is still here, it is just, it is going, it is silent, it is in ninja close.
It is in normal normal messaging clothes that I call 101 nutrition accountability, so that people didn't freak out.
11:18
And I never say the word online ever again in the online space because dear God, the trash that you attract so anywho that was the lessons that I got from hybrid.
For us.
And so the big, the big takeaway is that by going through that process, I really want to know our messaging.
11:36
We are super exclusive in our messaging.
Now, after we saw, like we're like, we only work with Jim Motors.
You must have a gym.
You must be full-time.
You must have employees.
You must have rent.
You must like, actually be a legitimate real business owner.
And if you're not at the school, I wish you the best.
I hope you find Value in our stuff, but it's just like we're not so anywho.
11:56
That is, that is the history of hi.
But with that kind of little alliteration, the history of hybrid, where it is now and how it is massively, a part of the business model that we espouse, I just don't talk about it that way.
I just say 101 interest in accountability because no one loses their minds when I say that.
So anyways, I hope you guys have an amazing day.
12:13
Drop a like, if you like this, don't drop a like if you did not like this.
If you're listening at home or on the podcast, please leave a review because we always appreciate those anyways.
An amazing day and I'll catch you guys on people's.
All right back.0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually a pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
Good morning, everyone.
Hope you guys are having a wacky.
Fantastic Wednesday.
I wanted to make this podcast because it's probably related to the you know probably the Number one question that we get on personal lives when we have our events.
0:33
And so we're I'm on day, five of nine straight days of events right now.
And so I woke up a little bit earlier today before we have our fifth day of events to kind of talk about something that a lot of people ask about which is marriage and money, right?
0:51
And so I titled this does your marriage make you money and some people might read that me like Alex marriage isn't about money, which I find funny because it's the number.
Thing, two people, arguing marriage and maybe the work-life balance that the entrepreneur might have.
And so what I want to do is I'm kind of speaking specifically to the entrepreneurs who are married or are considering marriage.
1:12
And so I want to First lay out some like context which is one, I have not been married for 20 years and so I cannot say what that is like and nor am I claiming to know.
We will have a very specific, very unique marriage and we approached it somewhat differently than a lot of people do and we get questions about it all the time and rather than if you're if you're having questions about you or Merit situation, I never wanted you know and marriages or anything like that.
1:44
But what happens a lot of times after people come to our events as they either like go all in on a relationship with that tons of people who were with you partnered with someone who became got married.
After you know, hearing Leyland, I speak about marriage at our events.
And we've also had people who were at our events who after events actually broke up, got divorced, separated etcetera.
2:02
And so, what I want to provide is just a framework that we use used to look at our marriage.
And I think a useful framework for entrepreneurs to look at.
Honestly, the ROI of the partnership that they're, you know, beginning, right or there are in right now.
2:22
And so first, I want to kind of lay out the three things that we think Takes to make a marriage work, but also a Business Partnership work because ultimately, they're very similar in terms of how you're figuring this out.
And as a total side note, if you are a betting person, you should always bet against Partnerships in marriage because the likelihood that someone makes it their entire lives and does not end a Business Partnership or does not end a marriage is very low, right?
2:45
The only way that it would be quote successful is if you, you know, if one of you dies essentially, it's like the only way that our society defines success within the context of marriage and Right.
And so I think that's a little bit morbid, but I want to give you kind of 33 kind of frame sets to work with.
3:03
So, the first is that, in order to have what we believe, and this is also adopted from different billionaires that we've listened to not just like, personally, but also their podcast, their content, their books, Etc.
The first one is that there has to be shared Mission, which is not just like within the business context, it's shared mission for what you want to accomplish, but within marriage.
3:23
It's really just like life mission.
Like what do you want to accomplish?
Together, we want your life to look like because marriage and Partnerships are truly just a set of agreements and a lot of people enter their marriages based on, you know, chemistry and love and emotions, right?
3:39
And a lot of times, we know, in business that emotional decisions, tend to not be very good ones, which is kind of interesting because we make the biggest decision of Our Lives based on emotions.
So anyways, figuring out whether or not you and your partner or a line.
And I'm going to talk about more of this within the context of marriage.
3:55
Probably do another one.
Oh, my Business Partnership, specifically, but within the context of marriages, the mission, right?
Are we trying to go to the same place and we want our lives to look the same way.
And if you actually spell out what you want your life to look like, a lot of times you'll find that might be different, right?
4:10
Well, what you think ideal scene is versus someone else.
And so a typical example of this at my present at one of our events would be, we have somebody comes up a like, listen, all I want to do is work.
I love working at all my spouse wants to do is like take vacations and take time off.
4:26
And I feel like we're at odds, right?
I feel like, we're not doing, we're not alive.
We're not doing what we're what.
We'll both of our deal scene is different, right?
What we're trying to strive towards is different, right?
And so, that is the first piece is like, what is an ideal scene look like, in terms of your life, right?
4:45
The second piece is shared values, so it's cool to know where you're trying to go, but how you're going to get there is different based on the values that you want to have, and so For Layla Die.
For example, we are both incredibly growth-oriented and one of the issues that I think happens with entrepreneurs is that they outgrow their spouses, because what happens is your business continues to force, you to grow continues to force, you, to level up continues to force, you to acquire new skills and your spouse.
5:13
Many times does not do that.
And so what ends up happening, is that people continue to grow.
I would say, you know, they continue to change in a certain way, and if you're not in the same environment responding to the same stressors, often times you grow apart.
Right.
And so for us or for me, especially because when I was looking, you know, evaluating spouses, our spouse options figuring out who was going to grow in alignment with me, was going to be one of the most important things in my life.
5:41
And so the final piece of the three, kind of Peace framework is complementary skill sets.
And so, a lot of times, if you have two people who do the same thing, right?
Or have the same skills you can step on each other's toes.
Oh and so I think just like in business you want to have clear divisions, in clear roles and defined roles having clear roles in marriage and house works the same way.
6:06
They found they did a study on when husbands, basically, this is kind of interesting the more housework a husband does the less likely the marriage is to stay is to be successful, which I think is crazy to think about right?
6:23
The more housework husband, does the less The marriage has to be successful.
Now, why would that be?
The research is possibly that it had to do with beliefs around marriage being more modernized, as in like, they, the kids these days, right?
If you were more likely to actually work and have a split, right?
6:41
You have a breadwinner and have somebody who keeps care of the house.
You have clearly defined roles when those people start mixing each other stuff.
Like why do dishes one way you do dishes another way.
Whereas when they're two different roles you actually can have clear, Distinctions and then people end up understanding what the trade-offs are.
7:00
Right?
What are agreements?
What do I do?
What you do?
What do you do to contribute to the success of this family, which is contributing to the shared Mission?
And so Gary Vee, I think probably pot popularized this concept, but the difference doing the cheerleader and the full back, right?
7:15
So I've only seen two different kind of structures work within marriage combinations, right?
And so number one is the cheer back chair back.
Hybrid, right?
The cheerleader setup which is you're the breadwinner, they are the the cheerleader and with the cheerleaders rule list is 100% support the player on the field.
7:39
And so, the last thing that a true cheerleader, a real cheerleader would do is tell the quarterback tell the player to come off the field when the game is on the line, right?
That's not what a real cheerleader to do.
They would say, you go out when the game I've got this.
7:55
And so what they're doing is actually Actually giving you your attention back, they're actually making the rest of your life easier, so that you can go out and win and fulfill your role and then they are fulfilling their role.
And a lot of times, there can be lots of fulfillment and doing it that way because everyone sharing the same end goal, right?
8:10
We're trying to win the game, whatever winning the game means for you, right?
For the full-back setup, which is the setup that Leyland I have is that we're both in the game together.
We're both in the trenches together.
We're blocking and tackling for one another to move the ball forward.
8:26
All right, personally, I had never had prior to Layla a fullback set up.
I'd always had a cheerleader set up, and I think it was difficult for me because all I thought about all the time was business and work and it was really honestly, the thing that I care the most about and obviously I was younger.
8:45
So I know that timing has to do something with this but like the things that I cared most about was the work that I was doing and I was trying to establish a career and Build build a foundation, and build a base so that I could, you know, support a family that I would want to have later on in life.
9:02
And so, Layla was the first person that entered my life and wanted to do the things that I wanted to do was sing time.
And so a lot of times Opposites Attract, right?
And then attack, right?
But Opposites Attract but a lot of times they don't share similar interests and so when Layla and I got married it was a very calculated decision of like okay, you're into fitness you Living the same way I do in terms of healthy lifestyle, how you eat exercise, these things are important to you, you're not going to try it off, real me.
9:34
If I'm trying to diet, you're not going to try and tell me that.
I don't know.
Don't work out.
Like that's not important, right?
You're not going to church sabotaging.
The things that I deem are successful to the mission of My overall life, right?
And so that's on the, the fitness and health side.
9:49
But also on the business side, there are times when your marriage may lose you money because your spouse.
House, does not agree with the commitment that you're making for your business and that's going to cause a lot of cognitive dissonance that's going to, cause a lot of pain for you because you're trying to choose between two, things that mean a lot to you, the person in the relationship and the business.
10:09
And ideally, if you have an agreement that set up ahead of time of the fact of like, this is what we are both doing together.
This is what this business is going to feed all of us.
Then you can make temporary trade-offs with, like this is going to be kind of rough for the next six months.
And I need you to bear with me, right?
10:25
I need you to let me.
I need you to let me do this.
I need you to let me win this game, because the game is on the line right now, and I need to be in, right?
I can't be thinking about these are the things right now because it's not going to work.
And so it's it.
One of the fun things about the full-back setup, is that a different entrepreneur?
10:42
Told me this can court, right?
That he had read a research study that when a couple enters a business together and makes their first dollar together, the likelihood that they stay married increases like fivefold which I think is fascinating.
Fascinating and I think it's like having a child together with someone, right?
11:00
Is that like the business becomes your child?
Because as soon as you make your first all together, like you're in it, you're committed in a new way, it draws yet another line to you.
It's like okay one is you start having sex and you like each other and then it's like okay.
You're living together, okay?
Now you have kids, okay?
Now you have a business that's like you are in, right?
11:17
You are super committed and so when couples come to us and they ask us these hard questions of like, okay, I feel like Partner doesn't support me in my in my life.
A lot of times you're like, well then you need to have really candid relationship with that, sorry, candy conversation with them, about what the, what the goals of your life is supposed to be.
11:37
If that mission isn't aligned, the likely that you're going to achieve, it is really low like because you're both trying to go towards different things.
I recently had someone who's like, you know, I've been dating my girlfriend for three years and all she wants to.
She has a job and she just wants to take vacations all the time.
11:53
Like, that's all she wants.
Just like loved her job.
She just Is it?
And I just want to work all the time.
Say, love what I do, right?
That can be really hard set up because they don't understand why you like, working so much.
Right, because to them work is just a means to an end rather than the actual end itself.
12:10
Right.
And so, one of the interesting things about entrepreneurship is that we Aspire for Freedom, right?
Most of us sign up for this game because we want to be free, we want tempura Freedom, we want to do the things we want to do with our time, we want Geographic Freedom.
We want to be able to be where we want to be, we want Financial Freedom, so that we can spend, we want to spend to do We want to do, right?
12:27
So it's do what you want to do, when you want to do it, where you want to do it and ideally with whom you want to do it.
And so that's like the ultimate Freedom that a lot of us are going after.
But what's interesting is that the definition that Society will give us in terms of freedom?
Because that is like, you know, Hollywood etcetera is that they tell you freedom is is not working, right?
12:45
That's what freedom is to them, right?
But reality is that most entrepreneurs?
If they don't work, they go crazy, right?
Like you can only watch so many Netflix shows.
You can only sit on a beach for two or three days before going insane, right?
And so, So, a lot of people have this goal that they isn't even realistic because they don't even actually want that.
13:00
And so I implore you to redefine your freedom as the freedom to choose.
Right?
And so if you as the entrepreneur like what you do, and you've already achieved freedom, because you're choosing actively to do the things that you want to do and ideally with the people that you want to do them with.
13:17
And so like for us, I work all the time.
Do I have to work all the time from a financial standpoint?
I don't need to work a day for the rest of my life but I I choose to work and for that reason, I am free.
And I think that if you can erase and break the break, the belief in your mindset about what has been given and passed on to us about what freedom is supposed to be and what success means?
13:38
Right, success to me is choice is being able to choose what I want.
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
14:05
Right.
And so if you so to kind of bring this, bring this back home, the the setup that you know, another entrepreneurial says like, hey I'm involved.
My wife has a job when can she quit?
Like that's an incredibly personal decision, right?
And so I try to execute these like, huge life decision, you know, pieces of ice like you should quit and join the business because that person might resent the entrepreneur for the rest of their lives because they left a career that they actually enjoyed or they didn't want to be In the game, right?
14:36
I mean, it's definitely a high-stress game.
Like sometimes cheerleader should stay on the sidelines but it's understanding what role Dynamic you have now if you can't figure it out, if the person is not a cheerleader, they are not supporting you.
They don't want you to stay in the game to win the game, right?
When the game is on the line, when the best of you is required, right?
14:55
If they're not there to support you, but they're not in the trenches with you, then that's when you're in no man's land.
That's when someone is pulling away and saying, why are you working so much?
You need to spend more time Things like that.
That is when it will start to great on you.
And that's where you have to have really clear, candid conversations about what expectations are and what agreements, you want to make, right?
15:15
Because they're trade-offs.
And at that point, it's a decision that you need to make is like, our our is our mission in life, a lot, right?
Is the way we want to get their values aligned and do our skill sets in our actions.
Do they complement one another?
Or do they detract from one?
15:31
Another?
Are we stepping on under the toes and creating conflict when There doesn't need to be in it, right?
And so when you look at it in that framework, the cheerleader in the full-back, I think it'll give you a lot of insight in terms of which Dynamic you have, and if you're in the in between, you have to go one way or the other.
15:48
And if you can't make the decision, and sometimes that relationship if it's a girlfriend, whatever, or boyfriend might not be the best one.
And that's okay.
You were to mean, like, it's better than consistently for the rest of your life thinking, like both.
16:05
He's trying to accomplish a different objective.
Well, they want their life to look different than you do.
Let's going to be hard because you're literally trying to create different things.
And that means it by fundamental, you're going to be in Conflict all the time, right?
And so, If you do not like, so if you have a fullback set up, which is what I can speak more you treat your relationship, like you treat a partnership because you are in a Business Partnership together.
16:31
It just, it's just double is important which means that your marriage has to come first before the business.
And what I mean by that is that if Layla and I are upset with one another everything in life sucks because the business will also suffer.
So it's like everything sucks.
16:46
But if our marriage is good, If we're on good terms then, even if the business is having a bad day or whatever, I know that like, my fundamental Rock, which is our relationship because we can build another business, right?
We can have another kid but like the machine, the foundation that this is built on Is Still Rock Solid, right?
17:05
And so in the full-back set up a lot of that, like the easiest thing to do is just ask really clearly.
Like what do you want me to do?
What do you want from me?
What do you want your role to be like a for our stocking?
Like, which is what we do for every role in the business?
What's your for ours for wife?
17:20
And what's your for ours for husband?
I know this sounds insane but a lot of times if you don't actually Define clearly what you want from the person, what their role, and what the results You're Expecting, our then that's when you come into conflict because you have unspoken expectations, right?
And so then you're upset about something that they didn't do that.
17:37
They didn't know that you wanted them to do and then you sound like a crazy person, right?
And then they don't understand why you're upset for some reason or you are upset and you don't know why that they don't like that.
They didn't do.
X y&z, right.
And so, Layla was the first person that I ever dated that made me money, right?
17:56
When we the, the moment that I knew that I was going to marry her was when things were crumbling in the business and I was stressed beyond belief, and I actually asked for one month break.
I was like, I just need to time to just like get my shit together.
And so she actually flew out to launch a gym.
18:15
And in that month, she broke every sales record.
That we never had, she still holds the record.
She did 240 sales in 28 days and I saw that as someone who was strong a when I was weak, but stood tall when things were crumbling.
18:34
So when the pressure was on, she was better.
And for me that was probably the single one of the, I mean there were multiple turning points in the relationship, but when she came back from that, I was like, man, this bitch is hard and I I saw that and I was like, but I want to go to war with and I think that if you look at your spouse as someone you're going to war with because a lot of times Life Is War, you know?
18:58
I mean it's a series of battles and the wars, the mission, you're trying to accomplish, right?
And the nice thing is that the Michigan change together when you decide together with, if you want your life, to look differently and the beauty of the full-back setup is your both sharing the same experiences that are going to shape your viewpoints.
19:14
And so my belief, at least with Layla is that if we input the same data, we will come to the same conclusions because we have the same values.
And so if we ever have disagreements, the first question is, like, what information are you working off of what experience are you projecting onto this?
19:31
That, I'm not that I don't have and so when we do that, we can figure out what data, we don't have together.
So that once we're both information dup, that it's like cool, we use the same decision, making framework, where you get in trouble is where you have different values, which means you see the world in different.
19:48
Base.
Which means you make decisions that are different based on the same information and that's where things get trouble because you just, you get into a lock, you get into a standstill of like, oh shit, what do we do now?
I think we should do this.
They think we should do this and like you can compromise, but on some level, you disagree fundamentally with what you should be doing, all right, both of you are dissatisfied because you don't think it's the best way to do it and that's where things kind of go ride and so anywho, if you're a praising your relationship, if you're looking about whether a you want to bring someone into your business, - all right, do they fit clearly a cheerleader or fullback framework?
20:23
Are they?
A person who wants to cheer on the sidelines.
Give you your attention back, take care of the kids.
Take care of the house.
Take care of all the things give you attention back.
All right.
The definition of helped, by the way, is giving someone attention back.
If you've read someone in your life, who like comes in, as I just want to help you and you're like, you are not helping me, you are making my life way harder, right?
20:42
That is not how the definition of help is that you were making someone's life easier that knowing is in their life goes down.
So that they can take more attention and apply it to the thing that helps both of you in the long run, right?
And that's what Agreements are based on.
It is a contract, right?
Like you literally sign a contract when you get married.
20:58
And so you should look at the terms of that agreement before you sign, right?
And if you hadn't figured what out those terms are you need to sit down and have a really real conversation very soon and that conversation may be one of the hardest ones you have in your life but it's one of the most important ones to not sugarcoat shit and one of the easiest hacks to figure out how to have that conversation, is everything that you tell your friends about.
21:18
Bout what?
You wish your wife did or what she is not doing same thing goes for husbands.
Whatever save those words.
Exactly.
The way you're saying it to them because usually when you say that you're not sugarcoating, it you're being real.
You're being direct say those words to your spouse and when you say that, then a lot of times, you'll be shocked at the response, which is like I just didn't know that.
21:37
That's what you want.
I can do that, I love you, I just didn't know that.
That's what you wanted and I didn't know that.
That's what you needed and we can communicate that way.
A lot of times you will be able to win and so To bring this all home.
If you're praising your relationship and you're in business together, clearly Define your roles.
21:57
All right?
You have to have clear Lanes just like you do at home right?
You have to have clearly needs of operation.
You can't be stepping on one another's toes.
It doesn't work if it's like it's me and then so and so is my helper.
Does not work and you're both doing the same things.
It's like you end up having conflicts.
Who's anyone is going to do some things differently?
22:12
I would operate the business differently than Layla does but I think she's better at it and she frees up my time so that I can Market sell and focus on the product right now.
If you have the cheerleader, set up again, clear definition, clear roles, clear communication.
But here the definition of our roles is, I'm 100% in the business, you're 100% out of the business, but your role is to support me so that I can support our family, right?
22:36
And so if you don't know where you stand, then you need to figure out where you stand with your partner and whether you want the same things.
And if you get to the end of that conversation, you find out that given the same information, you want to print out comes then it's something that you need to be able to have a very like You need to be okay with breaking up a partnership.
22:56
That is not helping you towards your goal because you're not helping them towards.
There's For real.
And so, anyway, I hope this at least helps some of the people who are trying, you know, making a decision of like, am I going to go all-in on this relationship right now, on the flip side, if you have someone who's been in your business, right, and this happens, someone starts working for you.
23:18
All right?
That's all available, but I've seen this for this happen, a lot in our community.
If someone starts working for you and you were the entrepreneur and they become the operator and they start just running things and just making your life easier.
Oh my God.
And then also, you start having feelings for that person.
A lot of times those setups are actually really successful because those people came in with clearly defined roles and a shared Mission and usually shared values.
23:40
And so Layla, nice relationship started that way.
She started working for me at basically the exact same moment that we started dating.
And so if you, if you can have one of those setups sometimes you just need to go all in.
Because as soon as you can actually make it clear that we now have one bank account.
23:56
This is our business together.
This is our child then.
I'll tell you that we got so much more attention back, especially from Layla not worrying.
Like what am I going to have to do?
If Alex breaks up with right, am I going to be stuck?
Because I've been building his business but as soon as it became our business, she got a ton of attention back from all of the other things that she was still contemplating because there's always sort of one foot out the door bullshit, if you say there's not like until in my opinion like until you're in it.
24:23
Like until you're both financially and because like, when you're married, then my assets be comers like until your shared their, it's Ali hard to not have one foot out the door because you're human, right.
You're going to see, you're not, you're going to fight to survive and you're going to always think about what you have to do if shit hits the fan.
24:39
And so if you have that Dynamic, I've seen that Dynamic be successful many, many times.
And sometimes you just need to go all in and it'll multiply, it'll amplify the power of your Dynamic.
If you had a business before you started dating someone, and then, all they want to do is take you away from your business.
24:55
A lot of times I see that that Dynamic not work, right?
Because they're not.
For you and they're not supporting you in your business and you made your business because you had a mission, you had a view of what you want to have in your life that you're working towards.
If they're not helping you, your romantic chemistry will fade, but your mission will not.
25:14
And then on the flip side, sometimes if you have somebody who you started, you were with, before you started your business.
I've seen the cheerleader Dynamic work.
Their work really well, right?
You might like, maybe your Highschool sweethearts or your college sweethearts and they, oh, they Seen, you, since the beginning they've seen these desires, they've seen these dreams.
25:33
And they've helped you Foster these dreams, and they believed in you and said, go do it.
I got you, I want you to accomplish your dreams.
I want to support you, and those instances, those are more cheerleader Dynamics and they work.
Well, and just more clearly, defining the agreement, more clearly defining, what outcomes we want will ultimately lead to better success.
25:50
And so, those are the Frameworks that Leland are looking at.
When someone asks us like, what should I do about this relationship?
It's incredibly personal decision, I could never, you know, say what to do, what not to be.
Only you guys know your relationship Dynamic only you know what you really want only they know what they really want.
26:06
But all I can say is like do not force your will on someone else especially if you're the entrepreneur in your little bit more forceful, your little more D, dominant type personality.
All you're going to do is breed resentment in someone who doesn't want to be doing what you're forcing them to do.
And so look at those Dynamics, look at the cheerleader.
26:22
Look at the full-back.
Look at the middle of the road Dynamic and if you're in one of these either, figure out how you can get into the cheerleader, or the fullback or maybe, You know.
All right.
Have an amazing day.
Hope you have a fantastic Wednesday and I will see you guys on the flip side.
Keeping awesome.0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
Hey, what's gonna happen?
Tuesday.
Hope you guys are having a great second day of the week.
For those of you who go by know, we days, I just came off of a 10-day Bender of events that we had in person, which is awesome, very filling up the cup figuratively.
0:46
And so I have a lot of like little lots of repeat questions and things like that, they got a dress and so I may have a flurry of content that may be coming our way.
And so one that one that I woke up today thinking about was about leveling up.
And so What are the biggest most successful podcast?
1:03
I had recently was skill stacking right?
What like why you're not breaking through?
Why people get stuck at the same levels and so what I wanted to do is actually break down kind of the next steps of that, right?
And so it came clear because one of the people who are at our vet, Layla described a pyramid, right?
1:22
It's John wooden's, Pyramid of Success and his entire pyramid is a series of traits, that would create success, right?
That engender.
He's a successful person.
And so I thought it was interesting to Overlay that with kind of the common stuff that I talked about with skill stack, right?
1:39
You have two more and more skills and you always have to frame your lack of growth in terms of the deficiency or deficit or lack of skills, so that you can then be in control of fixing it, right?
So if for example, you cannot create consistent sales, it's not man, there are no good salespeople.
1:55
It's, I lack the skill of finding interview.
Training and managing good salespeople, right?
And so now, it is something that's under your control rather than you being a victim of your circumstance, which you cannot control, right?
And so if you're consistently framing your problems that way, then you're able to identify the skills that you lack.
2:15
Now, here's where it gets interesting.
When I was thinking through this a little bit more because I had a lot of people ask questions about it in the beginning, you have to definitely stack skills.
You have to find your deficiencies and learn them.
And Learn these new skills so that you can get the first real money to come across the bridge.
2:33
Right?
And so you rapidly break through these transitions as soon as you acquire a new skill, right?
If you know how to generate leads huge explosion in business, right?
If you learn how to sell huge, explosion revenue and profit, you learn how to sell High ticket, another skill, huge explosion and bottom line.
Right now, you start acquiring these skills and that's useful.
2:50
But what happens next?
And this is where people get stuck.
Is that the next level is not necessarily skills.
Sometimes it's skills in addition.
To character traits attributes, right?
And so, I would say like for me right now, the two attributes that I needed to work on.
3:09
We're focus and patience, right?
Probably the last three years, I have tons of scarves of times that I wasn't focused.
And I try to do too many things because business has died from indigestion, not starvation.
I'm gonna say it again.
Businesses do not die from starvation, they don't die from not having enough.
3:28
They died because the entrepreneur Takes on too much, right?
There's always opportunity and the higher up, you go.
The more opportunity comes knocking and the sex year, the opportunity looks the higher up, you go.
Alright?
And so your ability to sing know which is focused which is an attribute, you could say it's a skill but I think it's much more character.
3:46
True to who you are, right?
And so to the same degree as you could say, consider leadership skill leadership.
A lot of times is acquiring a number of inspirational character traits that other people will look up to you for That they're willing to follow you, right?
4:01
You don't follow someone who's an asshole who doesn't care about you, who doesn't stick with their the commitment to who just doesn't exemplify things or morals, are traits that you want to look you know, that you want to Aspire towards.
And so if you're trying to lead people then you have to embody those character traits.
4:17
And so I wanted to differentiate that from skills because you definitely need to level up in skills.
But your character traits have to follow in suit and I can say this because if we're at these you know we're at our Summits and whatnot I was joking.
Some of the gyms.
There's like, some of you are curious.
They're like, man, I can't get through.
4:34
No one was like my employees, don't listen to me, likely suck, they're stupid.
But above all right, terribly upset, by the way, but I'm saying, some of you meet each other and were like, dude, have you met you like duh, right?
It's like obvious.
And what's even funnier is that that dude might be you, right?
4:51
And so consistently thinking about that in terms of like, okay, sure here are the Tactical skills.
I need to acquire need to know how to write.
Need how many creative I need to have headlines.
And you know, how to know how to create a funnel and, you know, to get people to opt-in and you know, how to nurture leads.
I need to know how to work that in total number of Outreach teams.
5:09
I need to learn.
Now, this is when we're be more of a character trait, I need to learn the focus and the consistent effort, right?
And so sometimes in the beginning, its the skills, right?
And then later becomes the traits that you have to do to consistently.
Actually, there's consistency is not a skill to character trait, right?
5:26
A lot of people don't have that character trait associated with actions, And the skills that you do in business, right?
So if you're consistent by its very nature, you're probably also focused, right?
If you're consistent and you're focused patients, typically comes.
And if you do those things with patients in the outcomes, typically happen on their own without thinking about it.
5:44
Now, here's where I think it also gets interesting is that if you're looking at the skills like in the beginning you have to acquire a lot of different skills, right?
Because it's like, okay, I learn how to write copy but I still have leads right?
Because there's more skills they need to get stacked together to create the overarching skill, which is Leads.
6:00
Right?
That is a skill set and of itself, right?
Getting people to say, yes, is a skill set of sales, but that would mean know how to build rapport knowing how to manage your energy knowing how to manage your head state, right?
Know how to put scarcity knowing how to provide value my to communicate.
But all of those things are things that would Encompass within the like breaking your beliefs are in pricing breaking least, our money, all of that stuff is stuff, that's going to Encompass somebody who's a closer now, then that person has to be consistent.
6:24
Then there are even higher closer.
Somebody who's not hot & cold, hot & cold, hot & cold, but someone can consistently produce This at a high level, right, that's character trait, right?
Not a skill.
So in the beginning, you're learning lots of new skills, right?
You're trying to build the, the steps of the bridge, the bricks of the bridge across the barrier so that you start getting the flow of money that start going your way.
6:45
Right mean, might need to learn 3050 skills to actually make the first dollar go all the way across the bridge.
And then the next one follows after that now we're gets interesting.
Is that now that you've learned lots of skills than typically, once you do that, you Soon as you start getting the flow then it's how do I get better at those skills, right?
7:04
So in the beginning, you're patching holes and then after that you're deepening the skills right?
You're getting better at the skill.
So instead of thinking more, it's think start.
Instead of thinking more in terms of variety it's more in terms of depth which is kind of like the next level, right?
7:22
And so first it's the variety then you have the depth and then I would say the next piece, right?
The next thing is the Actor traits.
That must be Associated that you learn, as you go, right?
Because these character traits are things that have to happen in order for these skills to be consistently executed, right?
7:41
And then for you to have the focus and the patience to consistently continue to dive deeper in these skills that you now have initially acquired, right?
It's not like you check the box and say I know how to write headlines.
Well, gee whiz, you can get better at writing headlines.
You can get better at writing copy and so there's a minimum proficiency that you need to do Just to be able to fill the hole, right?
8:02
But then going from filling the whole to massively digging deep to the center of the Earth's core, where all of the gold is, or whatever it is, right?
I mean, the analogies, okay?
But you get my point, right?
Is that?
That is where you get the amplification, right?
And so its first, you develop the skills, right at a proficient level, then you dive deep on those skills so that you get better and better at them and typically that comes through consistent, execution and repetition which means that it takes the character traits of focus.
8:30
And determination and drive, right?
And being able to be consistent and not go guy, go away and start looking at shiny objects, looking shiny objects, look in a new opportunity, looking at this other side.
Hustle, you want to do whatever it is, right?
Because there's always new things.
8:45
And what's crazy about this is that the higher up you go, the more seductive the woman in the red dress.
Looks like and I'm saying that from a matrix is my all-time favorite movie.
The Woman in the red dress.
I'm using this as a parable, whatever.
For opportunity.
9:01
And when you're starting out the woman in the red dress, always looks attractive.
And the thing is that the higher up, you go, the more of a 10 she becomes.
Now if you're a girl, then guy in a red suit, maybe that looks more like a pimp said, forget about that.
But whatever.
9:16
You know, George Clooney, or whoever your person is, whatever you like, what is that?
Like, I thought that I was having discipline and saying no to a certain level opportunity when I was starting my gyms, right?
And I had to develop that discipline.
Hey, guys, real quick.
9:32
If you're new to the podcast, I've a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over 1,000 hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I push the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
10:02
And then we started and then we started making a few million dollars a year and I was like, okay I need to develop a new level this one because there's more things that I want to do that.
I have to not be able to do.
Right when the biggest successful things I did was not start the supplement company until year and a half after almost two years after gym on started I had planned starting the supplement company at the same time as I started Jim launch.
10:24
Original three and a half four years ago like they were at the same time.
I wanted to do both and Layla The angel that she is, was like, no, that's stupid, don't do that.
And so she thankfully was like, you have to have, you have to stay focused.
10:41
And so because of that, we were going to have the explosive growth, we did.
And then at the right time, we were both out on now.
Big, big, big, big picture.
I don't know if I would have done it again.
I still probably would have stayed even more focused on Jim launch.
If I could do it all over again.
Now we have it, you know, we write a check for six hundred thousand dollars every single month to our gym words.
11:02
In terms of commission checks, that's real money that I can send back to the community and that's very fulfilling for fulfilling for me and it solved the problem that I always had on imagine.
So like, there are reasons that I did it.
And, and so, like history will tell whether it was the right call or not.
11:17
I can never live the life of what it would have been if I hadn't done it.
But I think if I were going back in time, knowing what I know now, I might not have done it but you never know.
So, I'm telling you, like I've made these mistakes, you know what I mean?
And the thing is that, that level All of opportunity looked even more seductive or seducing, or whatever the word is when we had two years more of a distribution base compared to when we had at the beginning.
11:43
It's our wasn't able to say no to her that opportunity later on, as I wasn't beginning.
And that was a deficiency in my skill set at the time.
My character trait of staying focused, right?
And, so like, I'm saying, all this, if you're looking at it in terms of verticals, the first step is filling the Pause and that stacking all the skills together.
12:03
So you can get the first dollar to go over and that's because it's just becoming proficient, not amazing, just proficient.
You don't have to be an expert at running traffic, usually to be able to actually know how to run an ad in the thing is that most proficient skills only take like, like not a lot of time.
12:19
Like you can Google how to do X and if you consume for like 2 hours of information, you'll probably be proficient.
Most people just don't take those two hours to do it because it's uncomfortable and you're not good at, right?
So you consume the information.
Action.
And then you try right?
And then you fail because you're not good at it.
12:34
You learn and then just use those first initial tries.
You learn more in your first 20 sales, then you do in the first 20 hours of learning about sales stuff, right?
You first time you actually step in the ring.
You learn more about fighting than you do, during all the time that you're practicing, right?
Because it's real, right?
12:49
So you're developing your stacking your skills and you becoming proficient at it.
Next step you have to do repetition and be weeping willing to get punched in the face over and over and over again, right?
So that you can deepen those skills and Amplifies, the skills that you have so that you can get to another then as you get to another level, then your character traits need to be strong so you can stay the course.
13:12
Alright.
Like the biggest thing in the book by Angela Duckworth called grit which is really interesting is that the people who are most successful in life, just stick with it.
Like grit is stick-to-itiveness is what it is.
So it's How likely are you to abandon a certain path to pursue another thing, right?
13:31
And the people in the Genin have very low stick with it.
Nests entrepreneurs, shiny object, shiny objects, shiny object, they're jumping from opportunity to opportunity and they never give any of the opportunities, a chance to be successful.
So one of the interesting things that maybe you can think about, in terms of a quote, you can take with you is you can be successful anything you want, just not everything you want.
13:51
All right.
That was a huge lesson for me.
Alright, I had a friend from high school, who reached out, who had a contracting business and a roofing business and they were flipping houses since three separate businesses.
And I was like, dude, like like what do you want help with?
He was like, I don't know, like what do you think I should do?
14:07
And I was like pick one, he said what we're making money and all three of them and I was like cool pick one.
Each one of those businesses can be a billion-dollar business.
You can be Billy doll roofing company, you can be a billion-dollar flipping Homes company.
You can be a billion dollar general contractor, there are examples of each of these things, right?
14:22
But you just can't be a billion dollars in all of them.
And so there's a fallacy that we tell ourselves as entrepreneurs, which is that if I do more things, I will make more money.
When in fact, I need to do fewer things.
Things to get to where I want to go.
And the reason I can tell you that it's the truth is because you naturally think the other way and that's what most people think, which is why most people aren't successful, right?
14:40
As they can't focus because there's too many things it just so easy.
Just as this one thing, you do this, other thing and also your to spread thin, you're not focused on a flying, the things that you're doing to get better.
You're not deepening the skills, you're spreading yourself thin, right?
And so once you acquire the skill set, once you become proficient, then you amplify the skills that you have by deepening them and in order to deepen them, you have to have the character Traits a sticking with it being patient, being focused learning to say no and doing things over and over again and accepting the fact that it may take years, it will take years in order to be cup to break through the next level proficiency.
15:14
Because When you were developing a skill, let me give you an example with to tie this as an analogy for Fitness, the amount of effort that it takes to maintain muscle versus the amount of effort, it takes to make Muscle.
15:29
As you become more advanced dramatically increases.
And what's interesting is that there's this big area of no-man's-land between enough to maintain and enough to break through and create a new stimulus for growth.
There's this huge area in the middle and most people just work out Out above minimum effective dose, but below the threshold that it takes to adapt.
15:49
All right.
And so when we focus or when I focus on trying to Get Swole and trying to gain more muscle, I try and go all the way to the other end to break my body.
The point that it has to adapt and get better, right?
And so, with the same thing with skill sets is that there's a minimum effective dose.
And then there's a whole bunch of area in between where people do stuff enough, but not enough to get better, but still, like, they could take the extra time allocated towards deepening, a skill and going all in on it.
16:15
And really push that forward and really deep in it rather than just consistently meaning maintaining where you're at.
And you can know if you're maintaining where you're at because if your level of income has stayed the same for period of years, that means your skill set has stayed the same.
And if your skill set has stay the same, it's usually, because you lack the character traits in order to deepen those skills, to amplify the revenue and to amplify your skill sets that you can make more.
16:35
Alright, so I hope this makes sense.
This was like, one of the, one of the many things that I probably talked about after the summit.
So leveling up.
Why we get Stuck and it's because the things that you need to improve on our different.
All right, in the beginning its skills but then you have to change your lens.
16:52
And then after that, it becomes traits, right?
Becomes character traits and those are very different to level up, right?
Because everyone just always assumed is going to be linear the same way and that's why people get stuck.
Is because the actual thing that you need to improve changes, right?
Not just skills, but the actual nature of the change itself changes, which is pretty cool.
17:12
And sometimes the skill itself is to not.
Do other things, right?
Sometimes the skill itself is maintaining the course and that is the skill.
That is the thing that you need to do to skip to the next level is to do less, and it's removed constraints.
So I hope that makes sense for you.
17:27
I hope you enjoyed that.
If you did like this and you're listening to the podcast, drop a comment.
Drop a like.
If you think someone else will listen to it, tag them tag, your friends, hope you have an amazing day and lots of love's always keeping great.0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
What is going on everyone who having a Wacky Wednesday?
I'm fired up.
Today, I'm gonna probably make a bunch of content, because I've had, like, ten straight days of events.
I have.
All these questions that people are asking me on my mind and little anecdotes that I shared that people found value in.
0:37
So hopefully, you don't mind me to sharing those things with you now.
So, the first two days, we're actually events that we attended and spoke at which is at SAS Academy dim or tells about.
And I was fortunate enough to be at the speaker's table, which was value in, and of itself.
And one of the people who's at the speaker's table with me, was a man named Marcus Rivera.
0:58
He was Vistas former Ed of pricing packaging and product.
So pretty much when they would acquire company, he would be the guy that would go in.
And retool the entire kind of fulfillment structure who they were serving, how they would break down, you know, the levels of membership etcetera.
1:14
And so, for those of you don't know who what Vista is.
This is I think the world's largest private Equity Firm for software.
If you put their whole portfolio together, it's over 50, do over 50 billion a year, there would be ranked third, I think in the world, A behind like Facebook and Amazon, so, like for like software company.
1:33
So they're, they're really, really big really, really smart.
And I was fortunate to sit next to this guy for two days, which was awesome for me.
And one thing became really clear when we were having dinner and so they have something called VSOP, switch is Vistas sop.
1:49
So they're, they're kind of their standard operating procedures and these things are so closely guarded.
You need like retina scans.
And like there's like you only get access to certain numbers of them if you're at certain levels and then they your access gets removed.
It's like super top secret stuff.
2:05
And this is literally how they create value, how they purchase companies, put their system on top and then increase the value that company.
And so for them, their whole Mantra is tripling, their money in three years.
So, it's three and three.
And so, one of the things that he shared with me, now obviously you can share like the the intricacies.
2:22
But the concept was really, really powerful for me.
And I'll tell you how we applied it at, Jim Lunch.
And so, one of the things that most companies don't do is they don't score their leads, right?
They don't score their prospects.
They don't score their customers based on the value of that customer, right?
2:41
And so scoring them can be based on a number of characteristics, behaviors Etc.
That that person shows to, you know, put them in a certain bucket, right?
And what Vista does, what they count on is the fact that when they go into a company when they're assessing A company in the diligence process that they're going to learn more about that company, that the founder and the people in that company even know about it.
3:03
And so, what they do is they parse out the data and they start trying to find the veins or the buckets of the most valuable customers.
Once they find those buckets, that vein of customers, that's more valuable.
What they then do is they basically expand and focus on that vein of high LTV customers.
3:19
Like it sounds simple and one of the things that Marcus actually hit on a lot was like he's like we we stick to simple.
Simple system, simple processes.
So when, when we, when I like said, things like the people who are the most advanced, never don't do the fundamentals.
I feel like I've seen this at, like, so many levels and seeing this from probably, you know, the biggest and probably biggest, you know, software turn around, increasing value company out.
3:41
There is pretty cool.
And so let me tell you what we did to kind of go through this process.
And so Mark was explaining that they don't even just do it for customers.
They do it for prospects opportunities and and customers.
So three different segments.
3:57
They are going to look and score at each each part of the pipeline, all right?
Using the analytics that they have in the teams that they do.
Now you're like, okay, cool, that's awesome.
Alex, how does this make more money at my gym?
And so let me tell you how we're applying it right now.
And so, what we did is we took the last 90 days.
4:14
I think it was July July, August September, or maybe it was September, I think?
Yeah, I think it was July August September.
So it's like a 90-day block of time.
And we looked at all of our exits, all of our a Relations with the with the people who kind of kind of suck the most are people who didn't get the most results in ever.
4:33
We want to put it, but people were the hardest to serve, and who got the least results, using our program.
And then we looked at the, the converse of that, the reverse that were the characters of the people who made the most money, who got the highest returns, who were the easiest to work with, right?
4:50
And so what we found, here's some unsurprising facts, if you are not a gym owner, right?
You don't do as well.
As people who are gym, owners crazy crazy facts, right?
And we also learned that if you are not full-time in your gym and you have a job outside and you're trying to do a gym as a side hustle or something you don't do as well as people who are fully committed to their gym.
5:11
If you don't have a signed lease, or in a building of your own, you don't do as well as someone who has a building of their own, right?
And if you don't have any employees, it's harder for you to do this.
Mostly because there's a huge time, constraint, right?
Like, it takes effort to implement new.
5:27
Because not only do you have to keep your existing business, going to have to start working on top of that in order to dig yourself out of the hole.
Right?
And so, when we found those characteristics, what we started doing is, we started filtering in qualifying, our front end.
And so we started doing this for the month of October.
All right, so we took the 90 days.
5:44
We found we took the findings and then we implement it for the month of October.
Right now, we're in November.
And what's crazy is this From the the previous four weeks.
So, in September the last four weeks compared to after we started doing this qualification, here's to crazy too crazy numbers.
6:01
I'm going to share with you one is once we qualify prospects that they had to have at least 25 clients.
They had to have a sign.
The lease they had to be a full-time gym owner, right.
And ideally, this was optional, but ideally have one employee or more who work with them so that they could share the load and so that they could actually focus more on selling and you know, work leads Etc.
6:21
When we looked at the after effect of that our sales decreased from over 100 a month, in terms of Jim's to about 40 to 50 right now, here's where it gets interesting.
All right.
So, that cut our inflow in half by qualifying, our customers, right?
6:38
Bye-bye really making sure that the people are coming in where the best fit who could serve the best.
Right, here's what's cool on our side.
Now that we've done this in the first 4 weeks in the four-week period since then, the people who Started after those qualifications, we've had zero escalations from those people prior to that, we have, we had 22 escalations as in people who were having issues, you know, whatever it is.
7:07
You know, I mean, just red flags, right?
The the prior four weeks so from 20 to 20, now think how crazy this is in terms of scaling a business and operational complexity as you go up, right?
Right?
So we had this huge vein of people who are taking up the vast, majority of my team's time and we're actually worth less, right?
7:30
They made last, they were worthless to us.
And so when you're thinking about scaling and maintaining operational efficiency and profit, if you're looking at the customers that that are the highest lifetime value, the best customers, right?
And here's what's crazy, the people.
7:46
So after that October date, we switch back to the defined in program which is what we did.
For three years.
So we did a brief stint where we, we basically sign people up for a year up front because we wanted to give them everything.
It was, it was a trial, we did a 90-day Sprint and it turned out that that didn't work nearly as well as having to find it.
8:04
And it's kind of the same way you were in the gym just like having a defined in program tends to be a little bit more.
It's a little bit easier for people to wrap their heads around a little more defined in terms of the skills that they need to acquire Etc.
But what's interesting is that the people who came back in we're actually paying more than the people who we're paying more than the people who we were letting in before.
8:25
So this this new vein of customer who's higher qualified is paying more is making more requires, less work.
Now that sounds like a recipe for a higher profit business, right?
It also sounds like a recipe for better happier customers.
And so also what happens if you think about it from reputation standpoint is like your if you lower the bar too much.
8:46
Then what happens is you bring in people who are not qualified, right?
They take up more of your team's The cost, you tons of effort and they're not making as much, which means that, then they say, like, your thing is not as good, right?
When in reality, it might just not be as good for them, right?
9:02
Which makes sense every like it makes intuitive sense.
And so I just like sharing these, these mistakes / learns with you.
So that maybe I can look back on this 10 years from now and be like, hey, I remember when we started doing that.
But now what our focus is is cool.
We know who the best customers for us.
9:18
Our and it's like dear God.
Why did this take it?
Three years to do this, you know, like, you know, learn from my stupidity that hopefully, you can start doing this with your own stuff.
And now, we're just going to focus double down on that vein of customers and try and expand that by really focusing on on them in multiple platforms, right?
9:36
And so, hey, if you're a return listener and you have not rated or reviewed the show, I want you to know that you should feel absolutely terrible about yourself and everything else in the world.
I'm kidding.
But it would mean the absolute world to me.
If you guys would go ahead and do that, you don't have to pause the show, you keep listening and you can just do it with your thumb right now will take you less than 60 seconds.
9:56
And like I said, the only way that podcast arose through word of mouth and this is you joining hands with me and helping as many isomers with possibly can because no one is coming to save us, it's just us.
All right, so please go do that now then let's get back to the show.
I say this to say, if Vista has has repeatedly, you know, been able to go from.
10:17
I mean, they're not a super old firm, you know, from basically nothing, all the way to 50 billion in a very short period of time.
It's because they know how to extract and amplify value.
And the biggest thing is not change.
I mean, they do shirt, they tweak the pricing.
They find the right bucket cetera, but they do that by analyzing the customers better than the business that they're purchasing purchasing, even knows their own customers.
10:40
And so I challenge you.
Now this may Sound like super La keep it's not.
All you have to do is look over the last three months.
Okay, look at the people who left your business, alright, and this is where you get the best data is from all the people who leave, right?
So look at the data from people who left your business try and get as like to think about as many characteristics as you possibly can.
11:00
What's their age?
What's their, you know, what's their job?
What are their goals when they sign up for?
How much money down to they start?
With what did they sign up for in terms of their continuity etcetera?
And if you If you can piece those things together, then you're going to get a really good idea of of who the good customers are and who the bad customers are.
11:22
And it's okay to have a Stern line because we're doing this now.
Now, the thing is, is like in the in the short term to be like, oh my gosh, my inflow cut in half but so did all my operational overhead and and the issues that like all that work, that the team had to put together to try and sort of these people who were not necessarily the best fit, right?
11:42
And so, so I share that with you and I'll give you one more tidbit that I learned from him.
And so we learned this from the from the whole event, which we took as a huge, takeaway for us, that you can totally apply to your gym.
Is that customers and recurring based business or really, any business, decide whether they're going to stay at two points at the beginning of your life cycle, all right, between the sale.
12:05
And when they start getting the thing, right?
The service, the product, the whatever and Once they start using the product, the implementation or onboarding period.
So in that period, so if you're doing an orientation with your clients, right, they buy something.
12:23
All right, the time between the purchase and when they start getting the thing, which be orientation, and the actual orientation itself is typically, when people are already, making the decision of when they want, whether they're going to stay with you in the long, all right?
Which means if right now, you just think you're Your orientation is an aftermath, it's like, oh yeah.
12:44
Now we have to fulfill that thing.
We sold your screwed, right, you're getting by just on the fact that like your, you have enough volume in the door but you're losing massive amounts of money by not making that completely choreographed experience.
That you're really focusing on over delivering a value.
13:01
And the way to do that is to demonstrate the skills that they're going to need to be able to use to use your services, right?
And so whether that like they not just not just saying hey yeah, you should download this app.
Yeah, you'll figure it out but actually doing it with them holding their hand and then having them duplicate the process so that you can see that you've transferred, the skill to them so that they now know and they are self-sufficient and being able to consume your services, right?
13:29
And so if your onboarding is rushed right, your orientation is rushed, then expand the time period because it's going to massively multiply the lifetime value of that customer and the likelihood that they're going to stay.
Whew.
So this is one of those few times where you don't want to be lazy and not and not deliberate intentional and how your onboarding the customer after you complete the sale.
13:52
So the communication that you have with them immediately after the sale which is like sending them a personalized video, you know, giving them swag, maybe a letter, whatever it is definitely texting them between the time that they make the sale.
Are you make the sale?
And when they start the onboarding and the second piece, I'm already going back to the beginning is the sale itself.
14:11
And so what We're learning internally for us to Jim watch and this may seem obvious but maybe I'm sharing it with you because we're learning to is that expectations, are everything, right?
Expectations are everything and if you set proper expectations for what is going to happen next and then you fulfill that beautifully your trust with the prospect of those up.
14:30
Now here's where it can get tricky, right?
And this is what we call selling hot.
It's where you were, you set, expectations.
So high.
It's impossible for you to ever fulfill or for you to hit that.
With the majority of customers, right?
And so this is where selling towards behavior and selling towards sustainability.
14:50
In long-term change comes really into play so that you can shift and Brake the beliefs of your prospect, to shifting, their time frame to what is really going to be beneficial for them rather than simply trying to sell them to say.
Yes.
Right.
And so an example of this is, you know, for us if if someone has only consumed test Ammonia and we've changed this in our marketing.
15:13
We've changed this in our testimonials.
We've changed it in the in the post that we tag people in is that we're really no longer focused on on saying like, hey, look at these 10 people who made a hundred grand in there first, you know, six weeks with us right?
We have those right?
We totally do.
15:29
But the thing is is like but what are the averages, right?
And so now we just share with the average gym does.
All right?
And it's significantly less, you know appealing I think the average gym right now is like they do 16,000 in their first six.
Weeks with us right now.
That's a lot but it's not a hundred grand in your first month and and showing that the average gyms are getting in terms of leak costs and Lead flow gives people at least an average understanding and we can explain to the person that means that half the people who sign up get less than this.
15:58
Right?
This is the average.
And so that way, if you if and when you do go above that Mark, then their expectations are reasonable and you can over-deliver, right?
And in an ideal world you would probably try and sell on the bottom 25% of results.
16:17
So that the expectations are so low that everyone is excited about the fact that they're overachieving from that from that Baseline that you have set for them.
And so what I've liked I'm continuing to learn this.
I like want to write like a whole presentation expectations, but expectation management is everything, right?
16:36
It's amazing.
What happens if you set really high expectations and This is where this is where someone makes twenty thousand dollars in their first month and is disappointed with Jim lunch and we've had this happen plenty of times, right?
They're like, well, this sucks.
16:52
I thought I was going to do better right when in reality, that's fucking amazing, right?
In terms of the big scheme now maybe this resonates with you because you've had someone who loses five pounds and their first 14 days with you and they're disappointed.
17:08
Now, why would they be disappointed?
Only one reason because the expectations that were set for them in the sale.
And in the orientation, we're too high for the average person and then most people are disappointed with what would otherwise be considered an amazing, great start.
17:24
And so if you can reset the expectations that are being put on the customer in the sale, right?
And you sell around the fact not around yourself through the fact.
And you break the belief around, what the expectation should be in a short and long-term Vision so that you could shift their expectations towards long-term change.
17:41
A process and behavior change so that they get ultimately achieve what they want which is Being Fit.
Forever, not fit for the next six weeks or six months, right?
And so all that to say the big takeaways that we have at Jim launches, that we are now heavily qualifying people on the front end so that we have longer lifetime value.
17:59
We have Superior client outcomes, we have less operational complexity because these people have the right characteristics of people who are successful both externally in terms of like what they have their gym.
But internally in terms of how they A work and how like, what level of effort they're willing to put in to be successful, right?
18:17
We found out that watch.
Foreigners are not a very good demographic for us and so it's like, cool, we're not going to service them, right?
Or not, going to service them in this way.
Maybe we'll create an info product that's less for them so that they can go through it at their own Leisure, their own timeframe.
18:33
Rather than the intense time frame that we put on to people, when they start Jim Lunch because it's really like ready, fire go.
You know, you have Any two hours and leaves are starting to come in, right?
And that's how we do things that you must because that's how I am, right?
But we have now used this on the qualification side and then also how are sales people are tagging and setting expectations and then being extremely deliberate and we're still working on this and making the onboarding and implementation even more choreographed and we have a pretty darn choreographed orientation process, but even better even even more reinforced, even simpler, so that the handoff is seamless, so that everyone knows Exactly what is going to happen before it happens and then they know exactly what is going to happen next in their experience with us.
19:17
And so you can use this.
All these lessons that we're learning right now in your business so that you can increase the quality of the customer set the expectations properly and then over deliver on the expectations that you've set so that they can make the decision in the first two or three meetings with you that they're going to stick with you for the Long Haul.
19:34

What's going on, everybody?
I'm bringing some more books, but I wanted to say that, if you haven't checked out Hunter million-dollar offers, I would definitely suggest that you start there.
I've gotten some solid feedback and it couldn't be happier with its.
Number one ranking on Amazon for direct marketing and over 5,000, five star reviews.
So, thank you guys so much for that.
0:15
It's 164 pages.
I really can help you out.
It takes about four hours to get through, check it out.
On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
The audiobook is Lowe's, they'll let me put it on for it, so I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
Good morning, everyone.
Unhappy Thursday.
0:31
Hope you guys are starting your days off on the right track and having a great start.
I wanted to continue the most frequently asked questions that we get at Round Tables.
And when people are like I have this dying question that I need to ask you and so this maybe you and your business right now and you're trying to make a decision and you want some insight on that decision and so the decision that I'm going to hopefully help you make is about that employee.
0:55
That you're not sure about, right?
You're not sure if you on board at them, well, because You're kind of busy.
You're sure if you set proper expectations and kind of the role has changed a little bit, you know you like them but sometimes they don't buy into some of the things that you've that you've said that you want to do in terms of the vision of the business and you're just not really sure what to do with them, you know what I mean?
1:18
And so I want to hopefully give you some context for how to make these decisions because we have hired and fired.
A lot of people at gym lunch, And you know, the nice thing is that we have had very, very, very few people.
1:33
Quit like very few.
I think we've had under under eight people, quit, and we've hired probably 100 probably 160 180 people and so we, let people go right and we do that for a variety of reasons and I will break them down for you.
1:54
So a saying to kind of set the tone for this.
I heard from my good friend Bart Miller, And he said I've never fired someone and not found someone better.
Interesting thought.
So if you think about it, right now, the fear is will, will I find someone better?
2:11
He is never and this goes for me too.
I've never fired someone and not somewhat found.
Someone better to replace that, right?
It's typically because we don't want to go through the cost of the time to find someone new.
When in reality, the employee that we have, is costing us more than the cost of finding the new employee, right?
2:28
That would come to replace them.
And what I have found over time is that if I think about firing someone, I always eventually fired.
And so the time between me thinking about firing them and actually firing them since we've had more experience in business as just significantly shrink, right?
2:45
Because at the end of the day like now as soon as I think to myself I'm like yeah yeah, they're just not a fit, right?
Like they're just or they're just not good enough, right?
And so this kind of reflects back to the zero tolerance mentality of how you need to run the business or your department or whatever.
It is which is like, how much will you tolerate, right?
3:03
Like how poor of performance will you tolerate before you say no.
Right.
And like the reason Steve Jobs and some of these few Josh burns are so successful is because they just wouldn't put up with that and so they're like, don't bring that shit to me.
Like they knew they set the bar so high that like, people had to do everything to measure up to their standards and anyone who wasn't was cut immediately, just like that, right?
3:28
And so, one of the The other things that's kind of big in terms of like making these decisions is that like, there's there's a time to let someone go and there's a time to re on board.
Okay, so I'll try and parse out the difference.
If someone questions your Authority or disrespects you or disrespect you in front of your team or is not bought into when you want to make changes things like that they're gone.
3:53
Right?
The reason for that is because that's an, that's an act attitude thing.
That's a character thing that is not going to change.
Right.
And not anytime soon and they're costing you more in the cancer that they exist in the business and the doubt and the seeds.
They're shown in your business that are - like seeds of doubt that they're showing in the rest of your clients, the rest of your employees, the whole organization, right?
4:16
So if it's a character issue, boom, they should be gone immediately right now.
If it's a performance issue, there's typically three reasons.
Why?
The performance one kid either, they don't know what you want.
They don't know how to do what you want, so they know what you want, but they don't know how to do it.
4:33
Or they do know what you want.
They know how to do it and they're not motivated, right?
So there's really three pieces, it's the communication piece, it's the skill piece, and then there's the motivation, right?
And so trying to figure out which is the missing link with them, is kind of the next piece.
4:49
So assuming they have the character traits in terms of, they have their cultural fit which for a small business, typically, the skills that you need to teach someone are not Overly complex.
And so when you're hiring for a small business, you're really just looking for personality traits, right?
You're looking for a cultural fit and one of the key components that looking for cultural fit, it's not saying I'm going to find people who are just like me because then you hire super scatterbrained, a TD semi entrepreneurial people who can be a pain in the ass, right?
5:18
And so instead you don't need to find people who have personality traits that are similar to you.
But have similar values right there.
Are people who are very quiet.
We're very reserved who don't like Yelling have the same values as I do, right?
And so understanding the difference there because you don't want, people are exactly like you because there's two of you and one of you, is it needed, right?
5:38
And so, especially when you're, when you're bringing people on making sure that they have the cultural like that they're bought in the same values, as you is makes all the difference in the world.
So, right now, if you haven't written down your values of what you stand for and these values should be the few, the five, maybe six values that you live your life, with inside of work and outside of work because you should never be discouraged.
5:58
Different, right?
And so if you have these values, you can speak them to people and people will either say, like, yeah, I'm down for that or like, no, I'm not.
And your value should be things that people disagree with, right?
They the more polar they are, the more they are your real values, right?
And what happens is when you make your values, polar you bring people in who do actually have your beliefs.
6:17
Right?
And then it's not the fake beliefs but the real beliefs that you have and then all of a sudden when they are presented with information, the same information you're presented, they make the same decisions and that's ultimately how you can scale sir.
This by scaling, your culture, by scaling your values, right?
6:33
So back to the back, to the decision of like, should they stay, or should they go, right?
If they're not a cultural fit, they're an asshole.
They under undermine you.
They, you know, they talk bad behind your back.
They, you know, they go, you want to launch a new program and they're whispering to the clients like, nah, that's not gonna be that good or, or like the roller is demeaning.
6:53
Like, here we go.
Again, like that kind of thing.
Gone, gone.
I don't know how to say that gone.
Gone, right?
And you need to do that to set the fucking tone, right?
Because like this is your business and people need to know that.
All right.
Now that being said, it doesn't mean being a dick, right?
7:10
Pull like there is a tone that needs to be set.
I I work with a person for a short period of time who ran trainers fairly well and I remember he's like he's like we need to do a trainer Meeting.
It was like okay cool.
And it was at like I can't remember was like 8 a.m. or 9 a.m. or something whatever and it was at one of the locations that was further away.
7:31
And so we drove there and at 9:00 on the dot, he locked the door to the gym.
And there were trainers outside, bang, right?
And all he did, he just went outside.
He's like all of you are fired.
Real quick guys.
7:47
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
8:06
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
And then we went upstairs to the meaning to everyone was on time.
He's like, he held the meeting and the fucking tone in that room was like oh shit, right?
8:23
And it was like, oh my God, like this just got real, right?
And so that's the point here, is that, like you have to have authority to business, if someone is undermining your Authority, they're gone right now.
If someone is not that they are, they are a culture.
So if you're in that you're like, oh, they're kind of like that, like just be done with it.
Let me like helped me make the decision it's over.
8:40
If you consistently thinking about firing them, you're going to fire them.
Anyway, stop Dragging it out.
Now, if you have someone and they're, it's a performance issue.
It's either because they don't know what you want, which honestly happens all the time because you're typically, especially a lot of small businesses aren't good at communicating things.
8:55
I Furniture in general, tend not be good at communicating.
They say one thing, they walk away and they expect someone to know it, right?
Happens all the time.
I think Leo says the biggest myth and communication, the biggest myth and communication, is that someone thinks it occurred, right?
You say something.
You think you communicate it and they have no idea.
We're talking, right?
9:11
So one, do they know what?
To do they know how to do what you want the way you want them to do it.
Three are they motivated, right?
And so the how do you tell them like what you want them to do?
It is telling them and it is always documenting what you want them to do in writing.
9:31
They so like for us if it's not written, it doesn't count, like that's like how we like.
That's how we believe things work, right?
If it's not written down.
If it's not an email, it's not a summary of a conversation that followed like that follows up a conversation.
It In happen, right?
And we don't even expect people to do it because we just know people we know better than that, right?
9:50
And so if you have a system like a sauna or something like that that you manage tasks in the new even further follow-up into tasks that they need to be need to be done, right?
And so one do they know what you want and if they if you communicate that to them you say it and then you follow up in writing next.
10:05
Do they know how to do what you want?
Do they have the skills to do what you need them to do?
Now that could be from past experience, if you're trying to hire somebody who's a little bit higher level unlikely, I must be were running small businesses and so if someone's coming in, how did you train them?
Right?
And typically people are under trained, their over expected and under train So, how did you train this person?
10:27
How many, like, real examples did they go through?
Did like, how did you teach them?
If you think about it, like a school class, like did you give them a presentation where they're taking notes?
And it's a consistent presentation, so they understand and then you had them demonstrated back to you and then you have them do it again and they had to do it again because if you do that and then you walk with them with someone live through this experience, whether it's answering the phone, whether it's making up alcohols, whether it's selling NG whether it's coaching a class like they need to know what it looks like when it's right.
10:58
Recordings are amazing for this because it takes you, no time and they can absorb what ideal scene looks like, right?
Because you can paint that for them, right?
And then once they've seen a bunch of recordings, then you can do a ride-along with their riding with you on the hip right there on your hip, they're walking with you, right?
11:14
Doing whatever it is, whether it's training sessions, whether it's answering phones, like I said, like any of those things, they're, they're riding with you, right?
And then after that, you do a ride-along.
But reverse now to learn Permit, like, you're driving.
But now I'm in the passengers.
You've been, whoa, don't do that, right?
11:30
What did you do it?
Right?
So I can correct in real time so we can get the behaviors up, right?
And then after that then they have their training wheels.
And now when they have their training wheels, that's when you still are talking them once or twice a day if they're new.
So that you can make sure that the expectation that you've set is being met and let me be real with you.
11:49
Most people have no fucking clue what they're supposed to be doing.
They have no clue.
They got hired for this job.
Job the boss.
Talk to them for like 30 minutes and then they just like went back to their desk and we're like okay so I think he wants me to write just like think about it from their perspective.
12:05
They saw an ad the interview, they got the job and then you spent 30 minutes with them and said, hey, watch some of these videos.
Alright, and then good to go, let me know.
If you have any questions.
Don't want to bother you, they like they want to bother you there.
Like, should I just don't get fired and then and then they just try and like, stay hidden because I like I just I just don't It's time to realize that I'm here, right?
12:26
It's just wanted this one to get paid and just like, not fuck up and by not and by wanting to not fuck up, they just don't do anything, right?
And you're like, and then three weeks later, like, what the hell?
I'm aren't they doing anything freaking employees, man.
They just freeloaders.
They just, you know, just expect to get paid and not work right?
12:45
When in reality, they just never awkward.
It didn't know what you wanted them to do, didn't know how to do it.
A lot of them were motivated, that's why they got the job.
Now, please do me wrong.
There's plenty of these people but like Most people would like to keep their job and so like if you just give them a clear path to win then they will write so big recap on this.
13:03
If you have this person in your business that you are not sure about if you don't know you know it's just like marriage if you don't know you know let them go if it's something that's cultural or behavior like or personality-wise like gone right now, the only.
So now that's probably like two thirds of people who are thinking about firing someone just fucking get him out the door.
13:22
All right.
Be done with it.
All right.
My you have my blessing.
All right.
Now, for the remainder, you're like, man they're bought in like they really are bought in.
They love what we do here, like I think they're a fit.
Okay, the role is probably changed several times since they've been working with you because you've evolved as an entrepreneur things have changed, the business has evolved.
13:41
And so you probably haven't really updated them or re onboard them.
And so just going through, this will just max, massively increase your Roi on that human beings time.
Right there are human which means there's another person who's working your business.
So you can get a A lot of productivity out of someone who has clearly defined goals and has the skills to do the thing, right?
13:59
And so one re onboarding through communicating with them and having it written down in the short term, if it's a project and it's going to be an email, if it's a long-term thing like a huge role change, then it's going to be a one page summary of their new role descriptions Etc.
All right.
Once they have clear understanding of their role, then you have to teach them the skills, all right, that's where you first, give them the recording, so they have an understanding.
14:20
Then you could like, you present, you give recordings, then they do a ride along with you.
Then you do a ride-along with them, and then they get training wheels, where you're touching base with them every day, sometimes twice a day.
And after that, then you can decrease your, your Cadence with them.
So that it's two or three times a week and then eventually you can get two weeks and then it pretty much.
14:36
Never stays Beyond weekly I mean never goes less than weekly after that so hopefully tactically if you're listening right now and you're not sure about what to do with an employee.
You can know whether you want to let them go or How to get them re on-boarded and back in The Fray so that they can be great and never be afraid to go because I've never, I've never let someone go and not found someone better.
15:01
And I will say that productivity of a team, typically always increases after someone is like, oh, and he also do it out of respect for everyone else on the team.
Like, if you have 38 players and there's a see player like that, see player, drags the whole team.
Like it is a team, not a family.
And so if you're like we're a family here like you need to get that out of your Lexicon because like you pay someone right?
15:21
You probably don't fire kids but you will fire someone if they don't perform.
So I just don't think it's worth having the fake, the fake family because you're not, there's a paycheck that separates you.
The dynamic, your relationship will always be one of someone who's getting paid versus paying someone else.
And so it's like this is a team you had to try out to be here and you got to consistently play to get game time, right?
15:41
Like that's it.
And then like if you're not you're not on the field than like I don't know.
Like that's it there's like that's why there are teams and people get From teams.
And so if you run Yours Like A Team, actually, you know, I'm going to a little anecdote.
Many of us in Fitness played four teams, a lot of us played for high level teams, and you've known, what a good coach is like, you know, what a bad coach is like, right?
16:03
You're like, man and some of you had the fortunate, like, circumstance of having a bad team and then having a new coach come in was a good coach and then the team turns around.
So, you know that, you know, the feeling of what it's like to have a high performance team, where there's expectations, where you want to make the coach proud, there's a Vibe of high performance, that is what it should feel like in the business, if It does not feel that way, that it means that you lack the skills to create that environment within your business.
16:30
And so one of the first ways to do that is to get the bad players off the team so that you can rebuild.
So anyways, hope you guys have an amazing Thursday.
Keeping awesome, lots of love and she has lips that.
All right?
It does not feel that way, that it means that you lack the skills to create that environment within your business.
And so one of the first ways to do that is to get the bad players off the team so that you can rebuild.
So anyways, hope you guys have an amazing Thursday.
Keeping awesome, lots of love and she has lips that.
All right?

Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
I think everyone hope you guys are having awesome.
Sunday, I woke up this morning and I had I had one too many somethin's, I don't know, and so, I wrote a little Post in the group.
0:41
I had no video with it and it already has gotten a ton of comments and likes.
And so I wanted to talk more about it, which is fear, monitoring, Fang, fear-mongering and the issue.
That a lot of you guys see in the marketplace, we were like, stop running six-week challenges.
0:57
Stop doing this.
People coming off these?
Things are low quality, customers blah, blah, blah blah blah blah, right right.
Of course you've heard the stuff so you know six-week challenges will kill your business.
Blah blah blah.
Okay.
You need to use your brain.
1:14
What I mean by that is you need to make an offer that converts.
That is the point, that is the entire game, right?
And whether that's a six-week challenge, a 42-day, a 28-day, a 14-day, a seven-day, a free workout.
It doesn't matter, right?
1:32
It does not matter.
Because at the end of the day, none of those things will help someone achieve their real long-term goal of having a sustainable weight loss healthy Lifestyle at cetera, it's not going to happen.
So what everyone does is to try and scare you because everyone in the fitness space at least has horrible views around money.
1:51
And so they think that in order to make money, you must be unethical.
And so, what they are doing, is they are confirming your fears that are unfounded because you have poor reviews around money.
So if you have poor views around money, right?
These are your pervious I can't make money because I'm a good person, right?
2:10
Which means you think I have to stay a good person which means I cannot make money right?
That is your false belief, right?
If you're listening this, hopefully you've gotten over that but if you have it in this is for you, all right?
And so when you hear a guru tell you that doing x y z is unethical, right?
2:30
You're like yeah, it's unethical.
I'm not going to do that because I'm a good person right?
And so then of course, they sell you some shit.
Let's not, let's not get into that.
The point is There is nothing illegal about up selling some one and only in the fitness industry is that even something to talk about, right?
2:49
Like like it's like it's mind-blowing like you go to a restaurant, they're going to ask you, if you want an appetizer, what's that a fucking upsell?
They're going to ask you, if you want dessert at the end of your mail, what's that a fucking upsell?
When you go to the movie theater?
What do you think the popcorn and the soda is an upsell?
3:05
When you go to McDonald's, they ask you, do you want fries with that?
What do you think that is a fucking upsell?
When you go to get your nails done, if they ask you what the gels.
The nice ones.
What's that a fucking upsell, right?
You go to rent a car.
They said you want the minimum insurance package or maximum guess what?
They're both fucking upsells.
Right.
And so for some reason, for some reason in Fitness, we think that if you can't like for some reason you're not allowed to Market bring someone in the door and then upsell them into something that's probably better suited for them.
3:32
Right?
The reality is the consumer that is out.
There has no idea the difference in a dance studio and a CrossFit, right?
They have no idea.
They don't know the difference.
Okay.
They don't know the difference in Quito in ple, oh, they don't know their nursing counting calories in a Whole 30 and eating clean.
3:48
They don't know what any of it means, right?
And so they're coming in with very low levels of education and so they're making their best guess which is why the first thing they asked when they enter the door is what's the price because they don't know a better question to ask because they're ill-informed and so our job as experts or supposed experts hopefully you're decent at something right?
4:07
Is that you can actually inform them of what other Options they have so they can get what they really want.
Right?
Sandra.
You're here, you want to lose 40 pounds, the 14-day free trial is probably not going to do for you.
What do you think?
Yeah, you're probably right.
Okay.
Why have you struggled in the past?
4:23
Well I can't stick with things.
Hmm.
You think if you had someone helping you stick with things like that, might be increase the likelihood that you're actually going to be successful this time.
Yeah, I think that would help you think maybe some nutrition coaching so that when you go out the girls the weekend like you're actually like do this and make it sustainable that would help.
Yeah, I think that would help.
4:40
Okay cool.
Let's sign up for that.
That then instead of the 14 day thinking, I probably not gonna help you out.
Yeah, I guess that makes sense because when I clicked, I thought that was going to help me out.
But now that you've explained this to me, I Now understand that this is what's gonna help me out more.
Because when I walked in the door, I didn't know there's in Quito and palea, right?
4:57
I didn't know the difference.
I know there's a need circuit training and weight lifting, right?
I thought we lifting would make bulky whatever, right?
And so like if you see this stuff that's out there and it's like don't mark it this way.
At the end of the day, you need to Marcus things that convert, we need to make offers to the marketplace that they are going to click on so that they come into the gym.
5:20
All right, like, I can't tell you to me how people were like I'm so glad I came to your gym and signed up for X because I never would have been exposed to all of this stuff.
Right?
And so it's the classic story of the ham and the garlic, you give them the ham, give them what they want, so that you can give them what they need, right?
5:38
You get them in the door so that you can actually have a conversation with him.
And have a chance at changing their life, right?
Like you don't mark it.
Hey you need to count your Macros and do resistance training and have programming and learn all these skills.
You don't mark it that way because Jenny ain't going to fucking sign up Hey guys, love that.
5:58
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, What does?
6:18
Uh, you're a mean.
And so what happens is, as the fitness entrepreneur who has a poor view around money, you think all of this is unethical, right?
All of this type of marketing, anytime I Market something, and then someone comes in.
And then, I dear God, upsell them, which is as American as apple pie, as American as capitalism fundamentally, how most business models, work is through expansion Revenue.
6:40
All right, Revenue, that is not the core offer.
And so you have these viewpoints that are false, right?
And you lie, Ow yourself to get taken advantage of because you thought through it.
So so if you want to not get taken advantage of Market, whatever the hell you want Market, whatever converts because your grown-ass person, it's your business, do whatever you want test stuff, right?
7:08
Like like you're like, like, you're not the, you're not this, like, you do want to be a six-week challenge him, then don't fucking be a six-week challenge him.
Find another offer, that gets Able to click believe it or not, there's tons of them, right?
There's tons of them.
There's a million offers, pick one.
It doesn't matter, right?
7:25
Pick one, get them to opt in and then dear God, maybe sell them something that can actually help them.
Rather than the, the actual promotion that they came in for which we both know, will probably not help them in these super long term.
If someone does a 14-day trial and they have no other things that get added on to that.
7:43
How's it going up them?
Right.
There's no difference between doing a trial and upselling.
Someone versus just up selling them on the first visit, it seems you time and saves them time but for some reason it's like we have to wait to do that so that you feel okay about it, ethically, right?
And it's pure, just nonsense, it's pure just it's pure people feeding on poor money mindset for trainers and fitness professionals, right?
8:09
It's the I'm a good person and that's the reason I don't make money.
Any right?
And it becomes okay because you're like, it's okay because I would never want to give up my morals, right?
That's not giving up your morals.
It's just being fucking stupid.
Like like you're not up selling someone who's just dumb, right?
8:27
That's that's all that is.
And so apologies for the passionate passion this morning I just like it just drives me nuts right?
It's called a straw man argument.
All right, it's going to say like if you Market this type of thing, your gym is going to become a turn Factory.
8:42
I guess what?
There are tons of gym to return factories.
And there are tons of Jim's.
You are not turn factories, and what they Market is independent of what they do in their doors crazy.
Oh my God.
Their dreams who work with us?
Who made Millions their attempts to work with us who make jack shit, same product.
9:00
Hmm, there are people at your gym signed up and didn't lose weight.
They're people who signed a bit your gym and have transformed their lives forever, same gym, hmm, right?
So for you Get over all of your like I can't sell people things.
9:19
Like all you're doing is presenting them information so they can make an informed decision.
That is best aligned with their goals, given their priorities and your job is to clarify their parties for you because people suck at making decisions.
And so what they do is they indicate interest indicate intention, they would like to lose weight.
9:36
They would be interested in that, and that is why they opt in.
And then it is your job as a fitness professional to help clarify what their goals are right.
If you go to a therapist, The first thing I asked you is like, what are you trying to get out of this right there?
Trying to clarify your goal.
It's helping someone you clarify, what you're trying to get out of it, you clarify the different variables that they have to work with and that you can offer support with.
9:55
And then you figure out which package of those things is going to help them get to their goal with the highest likelihood of success.
The new work backwards from their budget so that you can match the highest likely to success with their maximum budget, which also increases the likelihood of the person achieving it and increases the longevity of your business making it to the time that they actually can.
10:14
The goal in lose weight, right?
Your business goes under by the time, they're supposed to hit the goal then they don't have to go, right?
You need to be profitable to.
So anyhow, I hope that this maybe gets, I don't know, maybe tiger trainer, maybe you have a trainer who has really bad views around money and it's like, you're only about the money now.
10:33
It's like, well, how do you think you get paid?
Like not, not money from selling?
Like that's not the money that you get paid, right?
Like.
So if you have P, if you have people in your business, You have issues around making money and feel like like money is purely an exchange of value and if you make less of it, it's because you're not providing it.
10:52
And the reason that you are not providing, is because a lot of times you're afraid of asking to help someone.
Right.
I can make a whole video on how you always have to ask.
So if people are in the door and you do not ask them how you can help them believe it or not, they won't give you any money because the, you didn't make it, you didn't make them aware of all the things that you have it.
11:12
So simply offering people like, which is why I think everyone should have personal training on their price tag, right?
Like, I don't offer personal training.
It's America.
Everything has a price.
Would you do personal training for 101 for 10,000 a month?
Yes, cool.
Then put it on your menu because there will be someone who might take it.
11:31
And then you're both better off because they get their personal training and you get ten thousand dollars a month and you're pumped, right?
And so, like just people these morals around like selling stuff.
That's just like, it's insane.
And these morals around around marketing offers that just like, comes from just out of nowhere, right?
11:48
Like there are laws obey them, like once, you know, the rules of the game, then play the fucking game, you know?
I mean, like businesses to game the best people in business, when you hear them talk about it, they talk about the game.
Game because that's what it is.
So anyways, I hope that gets me one lit up on a Sunday morning money, morality fit for his greatest, nightmare Mark, or whatever the heck you want up.
12:12
So then because it's as American as apple pie, as American is capitalism, and ultimately helps your customers achieve with the actually want, which is a long-term outcome, and so just give them the option and then let them take it for themselves.
All right, have an amazing day, guys.
Hope you keep crushing your goals, and just keep it.

Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
Good morning everyone.
Happy maniacal.
Monday Monday And a Madness Monday.
I wanted to make a video today about some of the best thing about lots and that I've been digging into, which is churn.
0:38
Now I know before you before, you're like, oh my gosh, this isn't about fine acquisition, which means it's less.
Interesting, FYI, the if you look at charts of businesses, in you have in terms of business size, like Revenue, V SM B, which is very small business owner, it's like solo printer, you have smbs which are small business owners typically, brick-and-mortar business owners who are Donor with 35 employees, then you have, mid-market, which is where you're talking about, you know, 50, you know, 30, 50 employees, and then you've got, and that's kind of a wide range that could go up to several hundred.
1:11
And then you've got Enterprise right, big corporations.
And so what's interesting, is that, if you look at where everyone is focused at each of those levels, the people who are the most focused on acquisition and marketing and sales and all that stuff, our bottom bottom part of that ladder and the top part of that ladder, are the people are most interested in.
1:29
Activation lifetime value client engagement, things like that happiness scores, and that should be some sort of an indicator to you.
If the people who make the most money are thinking about the things that the people who are not making the most money are not thinking about.
So, I'm going to make this because this is about churn and about how some of my views are ensuring have changed in.
1:48
Digging more into this whole software world that we're getting into.
And so, hopefully, I think you'll enjoy it because it's going to make you money, all right?
So is turn dead, right?
So we know if you do My stuff that lifetime value is like all I obsess about, it's all I care about and I try and find as many ways that we can multiply any peace lifetime value.
2:06
The question, right?
Which is both how much they're spending in for how long they're spending.
But one of the issues that comes up is around churn is one tracking it.
Most people suck at tracking it, but let's assume that you actually do track it.
Well is the problem is that it's a lagging indicator which means that by the time you see that your churn sucks, it means that you've got issues It happened months prior and so when you want to make a change to correct Churn, it takes three, you know, it takes three months plus to actually see it happen and we've seen it on our in our business is when, when the gyms make start using the five horse or attention.
2:45
Typically, the first month or turned doubles, because what happens is you shake the tree, right?
You reach out to all these people and they're like, oh yeah, I meant to cancel that.
And so your turn doubles month one you're like, what the heck?
And then month to it, takes it from that Top Line and then it cuts it in half, right?
So it's like let's say, Somebody's at at 8% turn right now.
3:03
Month-over-month they go from 8 to 12, typically it takes years of my 50%, scuse me.
So 8 to 12 and then month to goes from 12 to 6, and then 1 3 goes from 6 to 3, right?
And then it stays at sub 3 after the do that, but it takes 12 weeks and it takes a lot of intestinal fortitude, right?
3:18
Some, gonads and gonads.
By the way are asexual.
So that's females.
Have gonads to I found out.
Anyways.
It's not sexist and you.
And so what We are now focused on within our business size business is, is not the churn but what is the leading indicator of churn, right?
3:38
What are the things that happen before someone's going to turn so that we can correct?
The leading indicator and we can see that happen faster.
We can also make that the goal of the onboarding experience.
The first one or two weeks of someone coming in rather than waiting to see if someone turns and then realizing that we have a massive issue, right?
3:55
And so, there's a couple things that can that can massively effect.
Turn on the And it's order to do is break down what?
Three of those things are, right?
So the first one is expectations, right?
So want to customers coming in the door, the expectations of both the marketing and the salesperson of the results are going to have.
4:13
And then also the experience, they're going to have to get there.
And so in an Ideal World, you want to sell cold meaning.
So, selling Khat is over promising, promising, the world doing anything to close the deal.
The reverse of that is kind of unsettling selling against people who sell like that to try and lower.
4:29
Vacations of the prospect, you're not doing that because you don't want to over delivery totally want to over deliver.
The thing is is if you set the expectations to the Moon, even if you do over-deliver you may still be below the superhot sale that a Salesman made.
Right?
And so what happens is and we have this early on in Jim launch, we'd have people make 20 grand the first month using our stuff but they were like I didn't make 50.
4:49
I thought I was going to make 50 and we're like in what world, how can we do this?
But it was really our fault because we had set our sales guys set where our marketing because we were marking all these testimonies people making all this money.
The marketing.
It set an unstated precedent that this is how much they were going to make, right?
5:05
And so do the same degree if you're doing, if you're doing weight loss, right?
Like with like, you're going to show some crazy Transformations, but you also want to show really kind of mediocre Transformations will talk about average results, right?
Maybe even the the bottom, 30 percent results.
And so we started to talk about this in our sales calls.
5:20
We're like these are the actual number.
Like, we're just, we're trying to be as transparent as possible.
Like, these are the numbers, because we know that if we're transparent, then what happens is.
The expectations are Curly set.
And so then we can actually over-deliver and then we can actually the light a customer rather than just meeting expectations even though what we did was actually amazing, right.
5:38
And so the first thing is expectations, the next thing is a huge breakthrough that I had, which is about qualifications.
And so the like I think I do, if I share this with you guys, but Jim launch, we've we massively increase the qualifications of who we work with right and that's because I did a 90-day experiment, we took on a bunch of people who were obviously lower on the business Acumen scale.
6:00
They were solopreneurs.
People starting out etcetera, and are terming through the roof.
The amount of payroll hours that I was, I had my guys working, which was super high.
So, just like all of it didn't work out, right?
And so we went totally other direction were like, okay, let's be super super high qualifications and what we bring in and what happened was in the first four weeks between before, and after we went from 22 escalation calls to 0, okay, after we implemented the change, the average revenue that was able to bring in for those guys.
6:26
And their first four weeks went from 6 to 30 We 5x the results of the product by changing the qualifications of the personal coming in, all right?
So if you think about that, if you can change the result that you were producing simply by changing the people that you were bringing in that has massive are McKibben ramifications.
6:45
And these people mind you required less effort because they were just more able.
Hey guys, real quick.
For those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans, I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
7:01
I'm doing that to build hype 400 dollar leads, but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers, make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
Its fo free in exchange for your email so that I can email you when we launched under leads.
7:18
And so that you can not miss out on it because last time I sold out for like eight straight weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
And so if you're looking at the three things that I was talking about, the first one is expectations, right?
So psychologically we can over deliver and what the marketing needs to look like and the sales conversation and the experience immediately afterwards, which is the onboarding experience, right?
7:42
I'll get to that.
As the third piece, who you're bringing in the door who you're allowing to say, yes.
So that's why you're not selling too hot because you're like, you know what, it becomes more of an interview process of.
Are you really a good fit for us?
Because we only work with these types of people because we know with these types of people, we can help them.
Crush it, right?
7:59
And so, if you can get super selective on that, then you can have these huge outcomes.
And what happens is your reputation.
Also only gets stronger and reinforced because the only people, you serve are good people.
And they bring good people rather than having kind of shit people.
And then they kind of don't bring shit people, but then they go and bash your reputation, right?
8:16
Because like, they're not able, right?
They're just not very able people.
And so if you think about that, now, the third one.
And this is the big one that I was referencing earlier.
Is you have to figure out what your activation point is, right?
So an example with this is Netflix So when they, when they have shows, they can measure how addictive a show is by where the retention point is, all right?
8:35
So you called activation called retention whatever you want to call it, right?
But there's a key point in most businesses were after something happens, the like the lifetime value massively expands.
So for clickfunnels, for example, as soon as they get someone to have their own domain, that that says like, you know, Alex.com and it has a landing page that person stays like, five times longer, right?
8:55
And so their whole objective rather than looking NG at churn is, how can we get as many people to this retention.
Point is humanly possible because it's a leading indicator rather than a lagging indicator.
So they can see improvements almost immediately based on process and change right in a Netflix.
9:11
They know that a show is really successful if the retention point or the likelihood that someone watches the entire show, all the way through the sooner, they can get that episode.
I think, Breaking Bad like episode 3 or episode 4.
If you make it to episode 3 or 4, the likelihood, you watch, all five seasons is like, Me percent.
9:29
And so there is a point that as soon as they can get that as soon as they can get a customer to that point, you push them over then, it allows you to much more quickly, iterate on how your retaining customers and increasing lifetime value.
And so, I know, Orangetheory because they announced that the one of the Summers that they did that, they figured out that for them for their business.
9:50
Now, they have different businesses than a more weight loss entered business.
Big, big big caveat here, their workout experience based business, very Different than a weight-loss business, just like throwing it out, but they figured out that if they could get someone to work out five times in the first month that the likely that the person is going to stay with me significantly higher, right?
10:07
And so that was, that was their big.
That's where they funnel a lot of their attention towards is getting people to work out that that fifth time, right?
And so for you right in your business, if you can, look at the people who are the most successful the people like, the easiest thing to do is if you just ran, if you're running a friend and promotion, right now, you're running a challenge running a trial, you're running or whatever, right?
10:27
Look at the people who actually succeeded, right?
People who converted and then, you can also be the people who stay for six months and you can look at both those as cohorts as groups of people and look at the actions that happen before that, right?
So if you're looking all the people who convert it into the into your, at the end of your challenge, for example, right?
10:46
Whether it's a detox or whatever.
If you know that, all of those people made it in for the first two weeks, they came in six times or whatever.
Then the likelihood that and then you can see other people cancel didn't do that or didn't.
Continue had that happen.
Then, you know that that is your activation point.
Now the thing is that this is a huge aha moment for virtually every business, so you're not going to get it on the first try.
11:06
And then there's a reason that companies, as soon as they figure out their activation point the explode, right?
Because then it gives you something that you can quickly iterate off of that.
You know, you can drive everyone towards which is going to multiply lifetime value, rather than constantly playing in the rear view mirror with churn.
Alright, and so churn is important so that, you know, that there's a problem but it is very difficult to implement solutions to try and fix churn now like a gym or We have the five potential, horsepower attention.
11:29
We have figured out how to do that, right?
And so, we reverse engineer that into a process that being said, there are probably things that are much sooner in the experience, like the sale, how they are sold.
And then, the experience they have when they're on boarded, right?
Like, do they know how to check like, did someone say, I like all of that?
11:45
All that stuff, that happened super early on is typically, when customers are actually choosing are making the decision of whether or not they're going to stick with the business, a long term, right?
And so the two times, The customers are really making decisions early on is between the sale.
And when they on board or when they start, right?
12:02
And then the actual onboarding experience, the first real beginning of them, receiving value in those two time periods is one.
The majority of customers are actually making their decision believe it or not whether they're going to come back and stick with your business.
And so despite the fact that they paid you, they're actually not, they're making decision of whether they want to continue to pay you for an extended period of time.
12:20
So, the sale really begins after the sale because what we're shooting for its businesses, lifetime value, We make sales to get customers, we don't get customers to make sales, right?
So you didn't portents, which in terms of how you're thinking through, so is turn dead.
Absolutely not.
I just needed a good headline.
12:36
But what you were tracking and this is an iterative process.
Meaning you try it multiple times to try and reverse engineer.
It is, if you can figure out what the activation point is in your business, where if this one thing happens, then the like that they stay significantly higher than that, is where all of your attention.
12:55
All of your resources.
Everything you talk about in your, in your weekly team.
Huddle's us.
How many people did we get the retention point.
Right?
Rather than rear view mirror.
Hey, we had extern, what are we going to do about it?
Because churn is really an outcome.
It's a, it's a, it's an output.
13:10
But the process change has to affect the cause and the cause is we have to get more people to this activation experience so that we can actually keep them longer and multiple at 70.
So I hope that was valid before you maybe have an operations manager.
Someone like that.
13:26
Tagging, this if you're listening to the podcast at leave a nice review, if you found that valuable, tell your friends Alex of podcast.com.
Anyways, have an amazing day guys.
Happy Monday Monday and keep being awesome.
Lots of love.

Happy Friday.
Hope you guys are having a good start to your week and like a sexy week.
I mean good start to your weekend so a good end to your week.
I wanted to get you the topics that are most frequently.
Asked and this one is about Partnerships.
I have tons and tons of scar tissue around Partnerships and they gave eight filled Partnerships that I can think of off the top of my head, and the common trait of those Partnerships is me.
0:43
And it is my fault that being said, from a lot of field Partnerships, I've learned a lot and I've developed, some fairly strong view points.
Around the subject matter, specifically, with Fitness owned businesses.
I titled this you work harder than your partner, does purposely Was somewhat illustrate.
1:01
Some of the issues that happen with initial Partnerships is that if you are reading this, you have a partner and you think that you work harder than your partner doesn't, if your partner gets it, they think that there are working harder than you are right?
Just by the very nature of the title, right?
Kind of why I did it, but there's some underlying truth there in that two, people ascribe different levels of value towards effort, right?
1:22
If I take out the trash, I think it's a 3 out of 10 or a 6 out of 10, excuse me and then my partner, she's me, take out the trash.
They think that's a 3 out of 10 effort and hear it.
Lee, there's a discrepancy between how much effort we think is put into X y&z, right?
And so the first issue that comes up typically in in Partnerships and so I'm going to make this specific to small businesses, right?
1:41
Because if you're let's say, like you're if you're trying to found a company, right?
You're being your co-founders and you're starting to technology or something like that.
Typically there's Clarity of rolls, right?
And that's the number one issue that we're small businesses.
Don't have that because most times the entrepreneurs are starting our new entrepreneurs, and don't know that.
1:59
I This having failed at times, like so, I'm saying this because I also did not know is that there's no Clarity of roles as in.
There's no division of roles.
It's just like, we're both doing this together.
We both put half our money in and we decided to start this gym, right?
And like you take the left, I take the right, like it.
Just the thing is that both of you doing everything never ends up working because both of you start judging how the other person is doing the same thing and they also start wanting to do things your way.
2:24
And so then you get in crisscross lines.
You think there's different levels of effort when one person takes a day off.
It's because he thinks he deserves Is it the other person thinks you slacking?
Right?
And so this happens and it continues over time.
Now before I go further, what I do want to note is that if I bet against a partnership, I have like a very, very, very high, mathematical likelihood of being, right, right?
2:43
And so, I'm saying this, with the understanding that I definitely have, the chip stack to my favor, right?
It's like betting against a relationship.
When you see two people together, like, it's not, that's not going to last, that's not going to last.
Well, think about how many people date and then what percentage of the people who did get married and then what percentage of Fail, right?
3:01
If you go from like total number of relationships to number of relationships that make it all the way to death, right?
Very, very small.
So if you're a betting person and you want to be a Negative Nancy, you should bet against Partnerships and relationship because that's typically what happens.
Right?
That being said, it's not going to help you so you work harder than your partner.
3:19
Does getting back to basically one of the questions I get all the time is like what should I do with my partner?
We're kind of at odds, like, you know, they kind of do this.
I kind of do this and So the easiest way, the only way that I've seen this work is that you have clear division between the entrepreneur and kind of an integrator.
3:39
The problem is in a small business, the op the level of operations necessary is not.
Super high.
And so you can find someone with a skill set to run a small business, is you the entrepreneur who does the promotion and selling etcetera, you can find that person and replace them for a lot less than it costs to have a partner and that's kind of the fundamental issue, right?
4:01
It is that one of you is kind of typically, in charge of acquisition and the other part of you is kind of typically in charge of doing the Fulfillment where it does work is when you have one bank account.
And so I do see, married couples all the time working together but that's typically because they're delusional.
What I mean by that is Ian Myself in this being delusional.
4:19
Like, I believe Layla is better than anyone else thinks she is, right?
Because I'm married to her.
She believes I am better than anyone else.
Think thinks I am?
Because she is married to me.
I disproportionately value her level of effort compared to what other people would value, right?
4:34
And so, we have these innate, these built-in safety mechanisms in our relationship.
Where if she gets busy because of something outside because of personal life, it's my personal life too and so I'm totally okay with it.
Whereas, if a partner has something that takes him away from work, if I were, you know, partner with another guy, whatever in the business, then I'm going to be like, well, that's tough, that's not my problem, right?
4:56
And you can see how the sink situation, how I approach it differently based on my relationship, right?
So going back to this partnership situations, partnership Dynamics.
I have seen it work in small businesses, fairly exclusively with married, married people, okay?
5:13
They tend to do really well together because they have innate.
Partnership Dynamics.
There's no real conflicts about money because it's all going to the same bank account.
If someone has to take the day to do something, for both of them, everyone's kind of on the same team together, all right?
Now, if you don't have that Dynamic and you are in a partnership, then the way and really the only way to make it work is to have clearly defined roles because then you don't have what I do.
5:38
This better like, well I should be doing that because I do it better than it was like cool.
Once you define the roles, you have to let that person run their ship, right?
If you're in Charge of marketing.
Then you're the one who's owns every aspect.
That it also means you have to take responsibility when you mess up right?
The same degree.
If you're running back half the ship, which is going to be, you know, fulfillment, retention ascension, all that kind of stuff that's happening on the back side.
6:01
Then that's going to be what you have to own, right and operations and the, you know, the weekly Cadence and talking to, you know, doing one-on-one, just daily Huddle's, all that stuff.
If that's you running the engine side, then then you have to own that piece as well.
And so those are kind of typically the division of roles the Is that Partnerships and small businesses.
6:18
There's just not a ton of money that is left over in a small business typically, right.
And so if you have two true entrepreneurs, they would usually be best served just both running their own small business and finding the person to do the extra things that they don't do for a fraction of the price of a partner, right?
6:41
And so most people just think of like what can I do today, which is like I don't have enough money to start this gym.
I need apart.
I need a partner.
But then like you're giving half away for like 20 grand, you know what I mean?
And I know this is like I did this stuff, right?
But the thing is, it doesn't really make sense financially.
Yeah, there's really no other way to say.
6:58
It doesn't make sense financially.
And so big picture, most times if I say, I don't think that your partnership is going to work or make sense.
It's because I also know that math is on my side and I try not to be Negative Nancy but this also kind of true Hey, Moe is an Asian quick break, just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
7:18
Alright.
So send me a connection request.
A note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or Layla's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
Right?
7:34
And so if you're watching this and you're like, okay we're listening to this if you're podcaster.
What do I do if I'm in the relationship, right?
Well one is you have to clearly Define and you have to have like a real heart-to-heart about the stuff that you are good at and that you're not good at and you have to underlie all of the tasks that are in the business.
7:52
A good way to do this is right every single thing that has to get done in the business.
The easiest way to divide it up is lead generation lead, nurture sales fulfillment and then Ascension, right Retention and Ascension and then lists all of the activities underneath of those things that you do as a company, right?
8:10
And then all you do is you have to Circle those things and assign them.
And then from that point going forward that is your Clarity of roles right.
Then you kind of have to just deal with.
It's just long-term what ends up happening is that typically resentment starts to set in because if the business stops doing well or isn't doing well, then you're like, your if it's not doing well known as making money notes, happy right?
8:35
And typically it's like that's always there.
If it does start to work, then you start to look at how much people are getting paid per unit of effort of time and work, right?
And then like I said earlier me taking out the trash feels like a 6 out of 10 to me and to you it looks like a 3 out of time, right?
8:50
And then there's this inequity that happens and inequity happens typically because there's not Clarity of roles that wasn't agreed upon in the startup, right?
And then you start looking at replacement cost, how much would it cost me?
To find someone else, to do the same job as this person has right now, right?
And then you start looking on the market, right?
9:06
You're kind of like, looking out for other relationships, like, huh.
I wonder if I could get someone else to operate the business for like 30 grand a year because my partner cost me like 80, huh, interesting, right.
And then you start, you start thinking thoughts that you don't like to think of that.
You don't want to think and you can't imagine the fact that your partner saying that about you like oh crap, right?
9:25
That's just being real.
And so I think fundamentally if I like like I try to always give Textual so I don't know your business, I don't know your partnership, I don't know your Dynamics but I'm saying what I have observed in general, is that for small businesses Partnerships that are not marriage Partnerships.
9:41
Have a very hard time working in the long run.
I also acknowledge that betting against the partnership in general over the long run is is in my in my math favor, right?
My mathematical favor, but you should think about why it's in my mathematical favor and maybe think about that when you're if you're, if you're starting a gym or your The second location or something like that, like I'm going to just partner up really, really really, really, really think hard about it.
10:06
Because usually, you're trying to partner because you're, you haven't fully developed out a skill set that, you should have write in a small business, you should have all the skills that are necessary to operate a small business, if you get into like bigger levels of business, like the required knowledge is more niched and more deep, right?
10:24
Like to run a small business, you don't need to have, you don't need to have relationships with bankers and you know, know, How to do fundraising and know how to do an IPO.
Like, you don't need those skills and so like I just get, I get annoyed when it's like you should be able to delegate him and bring people in.
10:40
Who can do each of these, like, in a small business, the level of like skill, that's required is really fundamental basics for the majority of the quote departments.
And most of the Departments are headed by one person, right?
Like Finance doesn't have like you have accounts receivable, you feel like you've all these things that don't really exist, much more business and so do.
11:00
Again the rabbit hole all that to say you probably think you work harder than your partner does and your partner's reading this thinking that they work harder than you do.
Which is a fundamental issue when you have a small business because everyone sharing the roles because the the skills are basic, right?
And it's hard to create Clarity around those.
So if you are considering getting in, I'd strongly consider, you get all of the skills to be able to hire and create a model that doesn't require having a partner.
11:21
If you do have a spouse in it, then you probably have a head start compared to everyone else.
And I have seen that work, many, many, many, many times successfully, The times where it's different is where the same people with the same skill sets, come in the door, both of you are trainers.
Both of you have clients both of you put money in and then the games begin because both of you have bring the exact same thing to the table and which means that there's no need for one of you and both of you realize it very soon.
11:49
And then just spend the next few years, slogging back and forth and talking to your spouse and talking to, you know, your friends about how the other person doesn't do XYZ.
And so it just it just gets into this shitty relationship and it's just a shitty Dynamic.
12:06
So I vote no, for proposition, 15 for Partnerships for small businesses, which is different than I'm like a large entity or something like that that requires more Niche based knowledge.
Like if you're developing a product and you have a product person who's going to be a co-founder, you have a kind of marketing, / promoter person who's going to be a co-founder or like a CTO like a coating / co-founder with like those situations make sense because there's clearly defined roles and Niche experiences necessary in small businesses.
12:36
It's really rare and so I would say don't make that mistake and if you're in that situation then do the best you can to clarify roles and set expectations and So sit out by Ops, right?
Just established early on what like what you would, what math you would both by one another out for and the nice thing is you both agree on it, then it goes two ways right there.
12:57
It's not unfair to anyone is like, I think that we would sell or we any person can buy the other person shares for x times profit or x times revenue or whatever, right.
And then you can stick with that on, trailing 12 months, whatever.
And then, that way, at least you have, like, you have an exit flap.
13:12
If you want to pull it, you can pull the cord.
It and you can start over after you have more skills or you can buy the other person out and start that, and really take the whole ownership of the business and cut the overhead of having a party.
So, anyways, hope that was on before you, I would say Tak, your partner, maybe don't tell your partner in this.
13:30
Maybe if you have a wife or something like that, you can tag them in it.
But if you did like this, drop a like or comment.
Anyways, lots of love hope.
You have an amazing Friday and I will catch you guys soon, all right.

If I take out the trash, I think it's a 3 out of 10 or a 6 out of 10, excuse me and then my partner, she's me, take out the trash.
They think that's a 3 out of 10 effort and hear it.
Lee, there's a discrepancy between how much effort we think is put into X y&z, right?
And so the first issue that comes up typically in in Partnerships and so I'm going to make this specific to small businesses, right?
1:41
Because if you're let's say, like you're if you're trying to found a company, right?
You're being your co-founders and you're starting to technology or something like that.
Typically there's Clarity of rolls, right?
And that's the number one issue that we're small businesses.
Don't have that because most times the entrepreneurs are starting our new entrepreneurs, and don't know that.
1:59
I This having failed at times, like so, I'm saying this because I also did not know is that there's no Clarity of roles as in.
There's no division of roles.
It's just like, we're both doing this together.
We both put half our money in and we decided to start this gym, right?
And like you take the left, I take the right, like it.
Just the thing is that both of you doing everything never ends up working because both of you start judging how the other person is doing the same thing and they also start wanting to do things your way.
2:24
And so then you get in crisscross lines.
You think there's different levels of effort when one person takes a day off.
It's because he thinks he deserves Is it the other person thinks you slacking?
Right?
And so this happens and it continues over time.
Now before I go further, what I do want to note is that if I bet against a partnership, I have like a very, very, very high, mathematical likelihood of being, right, right?
2:43
And so, I'm saying this, with the understanding that I definitely have, the chip stack to my favor, right?
It's like betting against a relationship.
When you see two people together, like, it's not, that's not going to last, that's not going to last.
Well, think about how many people date and then what percentage of the people who did get married and then what percentage of Fail, right?
3:01
If you go from like total number of relationships to number of relationships that make it all the way to death, right?
Very, very small.
So if you're a betting person and you want to be a Negative Nancy, you should bet against Partnerships and relationship because that's typically what happens.
Right?
That being said, it's not going to help you so you work harder than your partner.
3:19
Does getting back to basically one of the questions I get all the time is like what should I do with my partner?
We're kind of at odds, like, you know, they kind of do this.
I kind of do this and So the easiest way, the only way that I've seen this work is that you have clear division between the entrepreneur and kind of an integrator.
3:39
The problem is in a small business, the op the level of operations necessary is not.
Super high.
And so you can find someone with a skill set to run a small business, is you the entrepreneur who does the promotion and selling etcetera, you can find that person and replace them for a lot less than it costs to have a partner and that's kind of the fundamental issue, right?
4:01
It is that one of you is kind of typically, in charge of acquisition and the other part of you is kind of typically in charge of doing the Fulfillment where it does work is when you have one bank account.
And so I do see, married couples all the time working together but that's typically because they're delusional.
What I mean by that is Ian Myself in this being delusional.
4:19
Like, I believe Layla is better than anyone else thinks she is, right?
Because I'm married to her.
She believes I am better than anyone else.
Think thinks I am?
Because she is married to me.
I disproportionately value her level of effort compared to what other people would value, right?
4:34
And so, we have these innate, these built-in safety mechanisms in our relationship.
Where if she gets busy because of something outside because of personal life, it's my personal life too and so I'm totally okay with it.
Whereas, if a partner has something that takes him away from work, if I were, you know, partner with another guy, whatever in the business, then I'm going to be like, well, that's tough, that's not my problem, right?
4:56
And you can see how the sink situation, how I approach it differently based on my relationship, right?
So going back to this partnership situations, partnership Dynamics.
I have seen it work in small businesses, fairly exclusively with married, married people, okay?
5:13
They tend to do really well together because they have innate.
Partnership Dynamics.
There's no real conflicts about money because it's all going to the same bank account.
If someone has to take the day to do something, for both of them, everyone's kind of on the same team together, all right?
Now, if you don't have that Dynamic and you are in a partnership, then the way and really the only way to make it work is to have clearly defined roles because then you don't have what I do.
5:38
This better like, well I should be doing that because I do it better than it was like cool.
Once you define the roles, you have to let that person run their ship, right?
If you're in Charge of marketing.
Then you're the one who's owns every aspect.
That it also means you have to take responsibility when you mess up right?
The same degree.
If you're running back half the ship, which is going to be, you know, fulfillment, retention ascension, all that kind of stuff that's happening on the back side.
6:01
Then that's going to be what you have to own, right and operations and the, you know, the weekly Cadence and talking to, you know, doing one-on-one, just daily Huddle's, all that stuff.
If that's you running the engine side, then then you have to own that piece as well.
And so those are kind of typically the division of roles the Is that Partnerships and small businesses.
6:18
There's just not a ton of money that is left over in a small business typically, right.
And so if you have two true entrepreneurs, they would usually be best served just both running their own small business and finding the person to do the extra things that they don't do for a fraction of the price of a partner, right?
6:41
And so most people just think of like what can I do today, which is like I don't have enough money to start this gym.
I need apart.
I need a partner.
But then like you're giving half away for like 20 grand, you know what I mean?
And I know this is like I did this stuff, right?
But the thing is, it doesn't really make sense financially.
Yeah, there's really no other way to say.
6:58
It doesn't make sense financially.
And so big picture, most times if I say, I don't think that your partnership is going to work or make sense.
It's because I also know that math is on my side and I try not to be Negative Nancy but this also kind of true Hey, Moe is an Asian quick break, just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
7:18
Alright.
So send me a connection request.
A note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or Layla's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
Right?
7:34
And so if you're watching this and you're like, okay we're listening to this if you're podcaster.
What do I do if I'm in the relationship, right?
Well one is you have to clearly Define and you have to have like a real heart-to-heart about the stuff that you are good at and that you're not good at and you have to underlie all of the tasks that are in the business.
7:52
A good way to do this is right every single thing that has to get done in the business.
The easiest way to divide it up is lead generation lead, nurture sales fulfillment and then Ascension, right Retention and Ascension and then lists all of the activities underneath of those things that you do as a company, right?
8:10
And then all you do is you have to Circle those things and assign them.
And then from that point going forward that is your Clarity of roles right.
Then you kind of have to just deal with.
It's just long-term what ends up happening is that typically resentment starts to set in because if the business stops doing well or isn't doing well, then you're like, your if it's not doing well known as making money notes, happy right?
8:35
And typically it's like that's always there.
If it does start to work, then you start to look at how much people are getting paid per unit of effort of time and work, right?
And then like I said earlier me taking out the trash feels like a 6 out of 10 to me and to you it looks like a 3 out of time, right?
8:50
And then there's this inequity that happens and inequity happens typically because there's not Clarity of roles that wasn't agreed upon in the startup, right?
And then you start looking at replacement cost, how much would it cost me?
To find someone else, to do the same job as this person has right now, right?
And then you start looking on the market, right?
9:06
You're kind of like, looking out for other relationships, like, huh.
I wonder if I could get someone else to operate the business for like 30 grand a year because my partner cost me like 80, huh, interesting, right.
And then you start, you start thinking thoughts that you don't like to think of that.
You don't want to think and you can't imagine the fact that your partner saying that about you like oh crap, right?
9:25
That's just being real.
And so I think fundamentally if I like like I try to always give Textual so I don't know your business, I don't know your partnership, I don't know your Dynamics but I'm saying what I have observed in general, is that for small businesses Partnerships that are not marriage Partnerships.
9:41
Have a very hard time working in the long run.
I also acknowledge that betting against the partnership in general over the long run is is in my in my math favor, right?
My mathematical favor, but you should think about why it's in my mathematical favor and maybe think about that when you're if you're, if you're starting a gym or your The second location or something like that, like I'm going to just partner up really, really really, really, really think hard about it.
10:06
Because usually, you're trying to partner because you're, you haven't fully developed out a skill set that, you should have write in a small business, you should have all the skills that are necessary to operate a small business, if you get into like bigger levels of business, like the required knowledge is more niched and more deep, right?
10:24
Like to run a small business, you don't need to have, you don't need to have relationships with bankers and you know, know, How to do fundraising and know how to do an IPO.
Like, you don't need those skills and so like I just get, I get annoyed when it's like you should be able to delegate him and bring people in.
10:40
Who can do each of these, like, in a small business, the level of like skill, that's required is really fundamental basics for the majority of the quote departments.
And most of the Departments are headed by one person, right?
Like Finance doesn't have like you have accounts receivable, you feel like you've all these things that don't really exist, much more business and so do.
11:00
Again the rabbit hole all that to say you probably think you work harder than your partner does and your partner's reading this thinking that they work harder than you do.
Which is a fundamental issue when you have a small business because everyone sharing the roles because the the skills are basic, right?
And it's hard to create Clarity around those.
So if you are considering getting in, I'd strongly consider, you get all of the skills to be able to hire and create a model that doesn't require having a partner.
11:21
If you do have a spouse in it, then you probably have a head start compared to everyone else.
And I have seen that work, many, many, many, many times successfully, The times where it's different is where the same people with the same skill sets, come in the door, both of you are trainers.
Both of you have clients both of you put money in and then the games begin because both of you have bring the exact same thing to the table and which means that there's no need for one of you and both of you realize it very soon.
11:49
And then just spend the next few years, slogging back and forth and talking to your spouse and talking to, you know, your friends about how the other person doesn't do XYZ.
And so it just it just gets into this shitty relationship and it's just a shitty Dynamic.
12:06
So I vote no, for proposition, 15 for Partnerships for small businesses, which is different than I'm like a large entity or something like that that requires more Niche based knowledge.
Like if you're developing a product and you have a product person who's going to be a co-founder, you have a kind of marketing, / promoter person who's going to be a co-founder or like a CTO like a coating / co-founder with like those situations make sense because there's clearly defined roles and Niche experiences necessary in small businesses.
12:36
It's really rare and so I would say don't make that mistake and if you're in that situation then do the best you can to clarify roles and set expectations and So sit out by Ops, right?
Just established early on what like what you would, what math you would both by one another out for and the nice thing is you both agree on it, then it goes two ways right there.
12:57
It's not unfair to anyone is like, I think that we would sell or we any person can buy the other person shares for x times profit or x times revenue or whatever, right.
And then you can stick with that on, trailing 12 months, whatever.
And then, that way, at least you have, like, you have an exit flap.
13:12
If you want to pull it, you can pull the cord.
It and you can start over after you have more skills or you can buy the other person out and start that, and really take the whole ownership of the business and cut the overhead of having a party.
So, anyways, hope that was on before you, I would say Tak, your partner, maybe don't tell your partner in this.
13:30
Maybe if you have a wife or something like that, you can tag them in it.
But if you did like this, drop a like or comment.
Anyways, lots of love hope.
You have an amazing Friday and I will catch you guys soon, all right.

Welcome everyone, to the gym Secrets podcast.
Today I'm going to be talking about something I that it's just near and dear to my heart and I even got a coffee mug there's probably three things that I would say that I say repeatedly.
From a sales standpoint, one is the pain is the pitch.
0:34
So the extent to which you can create a need and a customer's life or make them aware of the need that they already have, just the pain cycle.
The more likely they are to buy your service, right?
You have to wreck someone we're emotional standpoint in order for them to become aware enough or increase the need enough that they want to buy your services.
0:52
All right, so the first thing, the second thing that I say all the time is the set is the clothes.
So if you have a two-part sales process which we We talked about a lot within our high ticket sales process selling, 2000-3000 our programs at your facility.
The setter is the closer, the set happens.
1:09
They're not necessarily when you're confronting money but it's when your edifying, the person that is going to ultimately do the closing because if I can say that you're going to meet with, you know, Grand Olympic champion, you know, the the you know, the child of dr.
1:25
Oz and and and gosh Michael Phelps.
Whatever, right?
If you're going to meet with that person, figuratively speaking, what's the likelihood that you're going to value that person's time and and B be more likely to buy their services, right?
So the set is the clothes and the third one is speed is King.
1:44
All right?
I had a sales manager who once told me that time kills all deals T Ka D, she had it written on every single salesperson said, desktop computer.
That was the background TKD time.
Kills all deals.
And so, the opposite of that should also be true.
2:01
Speed is, King speed is what makes deals happen, right?
And so and I had some some students of mine, I guess you could say.
Before I got into the world that I'm in, now I just coach them from zero to thirty thousand a month in sales.
They were just doing online personal training sales and that was fun for them and they just went and got up at the Baton went over 10 and then they went next time.
2:24
They did it and they kept implementing got better at it.
They did, you know they went 3 for 10 and then after that the next day they are not next day.
Next week they went, you know, 5 or 10 and then you know, now they're at seven or eight out of ten and now they're doing Group which is the self.
Anyways, the Are still the fundamentals.
2:42
And so when it comes to selling and you're getting leads right in the door, you need to make sure that you are contacting them quickly.
Alright like If you think about it, from an interesting point, the moment that someone Pops in for something, that is the moment that their need was highest is that moment when they click submit, that's when they've made that emotional decision, I'm in I want to do this, right?
3:06
And from that point on, it just goes down, right?
And it goes down very quickly in the first 30 minutes.
And then, from that point, it's like a nice slow trickle over the next couple weeks, okay.
And If you can focus on making sure that every person is contacted within the first 30 minutes, and even better contacting within the first five, I guarantee you that you will probably 3 x.
3:32
The amount of sales that you're getting off of your leads right now.
So if you're doing basic working right now and it's not quite working for you, I would guarantee that you're not contacting the leads within five minutes of them off doing it, right?
But how do you do that?
All you have to do is send a text message automatically from whatever your opt-in pages to someone's phone, right?
3:56
Super simple.
And as soon as that happens there phone buzzes is the phone buzzes, click the number, and call it real simple stuff.
Guys.
When you do it that way, you should convert about 50% of your links.
Crazy, right?
4:11
Right.
Off the bat.
And the beauty of this is that when you're on top of your lead sheet, which is a term that we would use You actually need to do less work.
You just need to do work when the work punks, because if you only do work on your time, What happens is?
4:27
You're like, all right, and you just, you know, out for hours, right?
And like, don't get me wrong.
If you coffee for hours, you're going to get a lot of people were scheduled, a lot of people get in the door, but if you're available and you can take that two seconds to call, some immediately literally half to three-quarters of your work, will already be done.
4:45
And the only thing you have to do is just follow up the people who didn't answer, but usually in the moment where someone has the time to fill out a form online, they have the time to answer A phone call and tell you who they are.
And be far more likely to show up and buy.
And then, if you think about this, this is one of my favorite things.
5:02
If you're selling something over the phone, which is usually a low ticket type offer and your speed to contact is within five minutes from the time that someone expressed interest in your facility for a promotion that you're running to the moment that they actually gave, you money can literally be 10 minutes.
5:20
Think about that.
Hey, if you're a return listener and you have not rated or reviewed the show, I want you to know that you should feel absolutely terrible about yourself and everything else in the world.
I'm kidding.
But it would mean the absolute world to me.
If you guys would go ahead and do that, you don't have to pause the show, you keep listening and you can just do it with your thumb right now will take you less than 60 seconds.
5:40
And like I said, the only way that podcast arose through word of mouth and this is you joining hands with me and helping as many isomers with possibly can because no one is coming to save us, it's just us.
All right, so please go do that now then let's get back to the show.
When the moment that someone opted in and expressed interest in head of desire, in an emotional reaction to an advertisement that you showed and they were, they were seduced Enough by you're offering your landing page to actually give you their information so that you could take time out of their day and attention, right?
6:11
That wouldn't their phone did ring right afterwards.
And it was you on the phone and then your sales pitch was sailing in the offer was, was provocative enough that they would say, yes, I want to do that and then they give you their credit card so that they want to get into the program the time that they expressed interest to the time.
That you collected money from that person to solve their problem was minutes.
6:30
Why is Amazon King speed the time that someone wants something to the time that they put they click, they click, you know, one click purchase it's almost immediate people want immediate gratification and the beautiful thing about about how you can do Fitness sales, is that you can actually scrap someone's that.
6:48
You can give them the gratification of having solved their problem very quickly.
After they've expressly now, by the time they get the result is going to be totally different question but it's the same thing with Amazon you need.
Thing you buy it with one click and then you're like, cool.
I got it and then you forget that you even ordered it that's what's crazy.
7:06
We forget that we even ordered and then comes in the mail.
Like oh yeah, why did that right?
And that's exactly how it works within the the Fitness business.
With sales, the faster you can get them in the door, the faster you can get them on the phone from the time that they opted.
The more likely you are to sell them more likely, they are to respond more likely they are to buy.
7:25
Okay, so make sure that you're still doing the fundamentals if a lot of you guys are like, man.
Like my scripts, blah, blah, blah, blah.
Make a stack the deck in your favor and just call them immediately.
Okay, make a massive difference in your business.

Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
Hey, what's going on, everyone?
Happy Wednesday, hope you are, enjoying your Wednesday or whatever day.
You are listening to this or watching this.
I wanted to go back to some in the trenches sales stuff I was on my mind and I haven't talked about sales in a while and I do love talking about sales.
0:47
And so what I want to do is tell you some of the most used kind of greatest hits in the trenches overcomes and kind of selling situations that I learned the hard way.
And so part of this came from the whole Allen project that we have right now which is our software that works leads people self-report their closing percentage.
1:09
So this we had reports for how much people say they closed so they they say they close 51% of people who walk in the door but with Alan they're forced to Mark, every single appointment as showed didn't show closed and close how much etcetera.
And so because of that, I have what they say, which is 51% and what they actually Which is 34 percent, which I think is fascinating because it just shows you how much we overestimate our own abilities.
1:34
And so in seeing that that that gyms that were working with, we're closing one out of three who are coming in the door.
I was like, you know what, it might be worth talking about sales.
So, first off, I want to just tell everyone.
Like, I subject sales, when I started, I couldn't close free trials.
1:52
When I first started my gym, it was like really very humbling.
I did I couldn't even get people to like give me the credit card.
For the free trial.
And so the first and probably most use thing that I use in sales in terms of in the trenches when I'm trying to close, especially those little itty-bitty sales like sales that you shouldn't have to worry about.
2:10
But but some reason somehow they like get messed up, right?
Like a free trial, like you should close on two percent of people on that, right?
And it should even feel, like I said, if it's freaking trial from a referral, whatever, right is, I would give people the contract, all right.
2:26
And then they would get to the crew.
Part B, like this free trial.
So, I mean fill this out, right?
And I'll be like, no, you do and then they would look at me and I feel like it's just how we've always done it and I would just shrug and be like, just how we've always done it and they would be like, okay, because that's how they've always done it.
2:42
Literally one of the best and most use lines that I use all the time, with any type of sale out there is.
So if you want because no one knows how you've done it before, but people do love following pack.
And so if you have something where you need someone to sign up, or you need them to put their card, then you need them.
2:58
To, you know, whatever, if you need people to do a thing, a certain way because more convenient for your business, a lot of times they just need to know that other people have done it.
Do I just how we've always done it and for some reason that that pitch has or that that line that hook has served me.
3:15
So well throughout the years my gift to you.
The next one is and I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to do one on retail and then I'll do a final one that kind of sums up all these other things in smaller tactics.
So one of the biggest ones in selling Retail.
So it's like selling selling supplements selling products, right?
3:33
Of any kind which you should at your gym because hopefully you don't hate money and people are going to buy many ways, the most evolved from you the most get them from a source who actually knows their goals.
What about?
So anyways.
So I decided that I wanted to share some cell phones because a friend of mine from college.
I saw him at the airport and he was like, hey man, how's your gym going other?
3:51
That's good.
I was like, how's your, you know, supplements or going.
It's like, it's good.
You know what about 75,000 a month?
And I was like, what What some protein powder are you kidding me?
And I thought this guy was not that sharp, and I literally was so like upset that this guy was making that much money compared to me.
4:10
I was just like it, like, so and supplements that I sucked at it.
So I could obviously process and whatnot that we have now.
But the single biggest breakthrough I had.
4:28
Was after getting beat up a whole day of doing orientations and trying to get people to buy cell phone.
Sounds like a really modern medicine.
You know, you're gonna be gonna, you know, be less or like all the stuff, right?
So I can science jargon and they didn't really care.
And finally, I had this really nice woman.
4:45
She's like, you know, the one with a nice ring and the nice person I was like, okay, if I don't sell this person, like I suck and I should just jump out the window, right?
And and so I got through the orientation and at the end of the audition, I I just was like, So, do you want chocolate or vanilla?
5:02
And she was like, which one do you like?
That's like chocolate.
Just like, okay, I'll take that.
I was like, really.
I just like slits where I was like, okay.
And then like knowing what had just happened.
I was like, for integrals, like we have strawberry, and we have kiwi, which, which one do you want?
5:21
And she just was like, and I was like, I like kiwi.
She was like.
All right, I'll take that Cecilia towards and I do want to scare her off, so I didn't go for anything more than the tip, right?
Time.
And so I was just like, do you want to just use the card?
You have them on your contract.
She was like, yeah, that's fine.
5:37
And I was like I just made and so this is like my first supplement sale that I ever did.
It took me a really long time to get there.
And so from a, from a tactical standpoint, simply asking, which one someone wants is some of the he's is one of the easiest and best ways to sell something because it's just, it's an assumed clothes and either or Close.
6:00
And I didn't learn that until much much later after a lot of pain and suffering.
And so, sometimes people say like, like and what's great?
Is that the First Act I could give you about, this is how we've always done.
It works perfectly, even in conjunction with this, and that's why I use it all the time.
So if someone says like, well, do I do I have to do, I have to take these these products be like, just how we've always done it.
6:22
You know, I mean, this is kind of what goes with a program.
That's how we know we're going to get that, you know XYZ like okay, that makes sense.
And so like, Just like if you use this two things in tandem together, you'd be amazed at how successful you can be because it's just like really convincing lines.
6:39
One of the other ones that I use pretty much all the time.
I would say it's probably the single overcome that I use the most when selling physical products was, if you change the variables you can't expect the same outcome.
That was the that was the clothes.
And so this kind of got a little bit further along when I was selling a lot more products.
7:00
If someone's like, well, can I?
So there's, there's different obstacles, right?
Number one.
Obstacle is like, do I need to do?
I need to buy supplements, right?
Do I need to buy these supplements?
Those are two, you know, different ones.
Like do I need to get them in general?
7:15
Do I need to get these ones specifically and can I have, can I just want to have a home?
Like there's all of those different variations of those obstacles and the one overcome works all the time.
It's just like honestly you came here, because you want this, what you've been doing the past?
Isn't working, and I can tell you that we can hit you here, but if you change the variables, you can change the outcome, right.
7:35
And like, literally, that little line of you can change the variables, you can change the outcome.
You're like, yeah, I guess.
That makes sense, right?
And so hopefully, these like these are the little lines, right?
The first line was, just how we've always done it, right?
That like you'd be amazed how many times you can close cards and get people to do what you need to do with that single line.
7:56
The next is, if you're, if you're going through a process like an orientation whatever, and you just, Say like great which of these two do you want?
Which one of these three prefer?
I prefer this right or most people prefer this right?
Most people do this.
All right most people end up like because a lot of people want to know what do most people do, they want to follow the pack and I'll have to risk making decisions and so you can even sell a bundle that's a four pack or an eight pack or something.
8:20
But being like most, like before you get to the end of the sales like honestly most people just get this and they're like great.
I'll just do that.
That's fine.
They're like you want chocolate.
Video and then you can go as soon the clothes.
And then if you change the variables, you change the outcome.
8:35
Right?
And that's really, really good for overcoming obstacles around, not taking the next step and that works really, really well.
So those are three easy little tactical in the trenches sales.
Tactics that I used all the time.
I think there's a lot of really fancy sale stuff and usually it's the simple stuff that works.
8:55
Like the number one.
Obstacle overcome that I used for, you know, I need to think about it.
I'm not sure about that.
What was always just like, what's your main concern?
Which is like, but wait a second Alex, that's not an option overcome.
Well, it kind of is because then they were they have to like, say what their concern was which then got me away from what the stall was and got me to like confront the issue.
9:14
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
9:30
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I catch the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
So, anyways, the last piece that I wanted to go over was a conviction.
9:50
So, this is a little bit of an all-hands-on-deck video.
Lots of little tactics the most important sale is between you and your service.
All right?
Like I can't say this enough, is that like a lot of times even like with our team with Jim Shu, come on board, sometimes they sell better before they like in the beginning.
10:13
They Sometimes there's some gyms to sell better in their first couple weeks.
Then like, six months later and what happens is, they learn the selling tactics in the beginning and then their sales immediately go up because you have to have some structure, the conversation etcetera.
But the thing is that their convictions really high, because they're Jim hasn't grown a lot, right?
10:31
And it hasn't broken.
And so the most important sale is between you and your service.
Because if you believe in your service, none of the other tactics, really matter, right?
If you've ever seen someone like, like M&M's are great example.
If you've ever seen someone sell, like, a product does matter what it is, I could be, you know, Rodan and Fields.
10:52
I mean, I don't know anything about the product, but the point is, if you ever seen someone sell those who, absolutely drinks, the Kool-Aid, who is all in, right?
It's, it's so difficult to overcome absolute conviction.
11:10
It's because what happens is it.
I don't know if you've ever talked to somebody who has Absolute conviction.
And this could be with religion, this can be anything.
The thing is, is their level of conviction makes you question yours and the depth of their conviction will make you question your like what do they know that?
11:27
I don't know, man, they really believe this.
Like and the thing is, is like, if you really truly believe that your product, your service is going to help someone, then you will be able to sell better, which is why Why as the entrepreneur / CEO Etc like you need to constantly be in the trenches on the other side so that you can keep your conviction sky-high so that you can continually acquire customers.
11:55
And so it's this Balancing Act and that's where it gets difficult because this is one of the difficult parts of business.
You know what I mean?
Is that like you may know that you need to make sales in order to pay payroll, right?
And you know, that you need to pay payroll in order to improve your business over time.
12:13
There may be times when your product or your service is not as good as you want it to be.
And let me just give you the surprise here, it will never be as good as you want it to be, but what you need to do is think about the Alternatives.
And so I think one of the biggest things that helped me with my conviction in selling in general is considering the Alternatives and I actually use this in sales presentations, you know, with someone anyways.
12:36
But it's like, whoo.
Let's consider the options which is actually one of our obstacle over comes in.
The bug is like, consider the options close, like, what what are you going to do?
Do right.
What else are you going to do?
And so you may not be perfect because you'll never be perfect, right?
Like Jim launch will never be perfect like as much as I want to.
12:52
There's and I honestly in any coaching business, like, I you cannot eat the food for your client, you cannot work out for your client.
I cannot call the leads for you.
I cannot make your ads for you, right?
I cannot coach your team for you.
I cannot teach your classes for you.
I cannot do that, right?
13:08
And therefore, there is a disconnect between my product in the results that are going to occur period.
David Wright.
It cannot I cannot which is one of the reasons I like Prestige labs and food.
And Alan, is that the product is independent of someone else's effort, which is what I really liked a lot about that.
But anyways, point being If you have a service where you cannot have 100 the control, you have to look at the Alternatives that that person might be pursuing if they do not use your service, right?
13:37
And so that's where you're like, okay Susie, it's been two years and you've gained 40 pounds.
So you know, what are the options, what you going to do?
Well, I mean I could I guess I could go to Planet Fitness.
It's like now we're already did that.
We, we know that that doesn't work for you.
13:53
Okay.
What else could you do?
I guess.
You know, I could I could try Weight Watchers.
Yeah, but then you lost it in, you gain more back right, lead be literally heavier than you are now, and you already feel like you're not happy right now, right?
So if you can 15 more pounds because you lose it and then gain it.
How would you feel horrible?
14:10
Right?
Okay, so that's not going to work, what else do you have?
And then like basically you exhaust the options for it's like so you really just need someone to like work out.
With you, make sure you learn how to eat the food, the right way, right?
And and make sure you actually do it with the accountability, like, actually hold you to it that way.
14:25
You won't fail, right?
Like, that's been the issue in the past, right?
Yes.
Okay.
And so a lot of times you can confront the issue, by having them consider the Alternatives.
And so like you may not be perfect, you won't be now.
You should do every, you put every ounce of effort into becoming perfect, right?
14:42
And trying to make it a man, like and the more this is actually really interesting.
So for us Like with our sales team, we recently had a call with that because they were doing a shit job or closing and yeah, just sucking and so they know it's all good, but one of the issues was they didn't know what we were doing on the coaching side.
15:02
Like, we done so many things recently.
Like, we like so many processes are implementation teams, and all these things.
And really, and this is where Layla popped in and she was like, do you guys know what we're doing on that side and they're like, no, we don't know what you're doing and so she just This is like we do this on day one and a two, and a three and a five, and a seven and a problem, right?
15:21
And they were like, wow, that was like, amazing.
And so, like this week the right back to where they, you know, normally and the thing is, is like a lot of times if you get too much in the in though, if they see this and they say this and see this and they say this it's like in the big picture.
None of the shit that I said earlier matters because if your conviction is Sky, High people will buy right.
15:42
That's it.
Like if you believe truly and this is the big piece If you believe truly more than they believe in their excuse you will you will win, right?
Not that.
It's a zero-sum game, but like like they will be convinced of your argument if you believe that much if you believe at a deeper level than they do about their excuse.
16:01
And so that's really what it is.
You know?
And so if you can like, so then all of your efforts should be in being the most convicted like you as CEO should be the most convicted of where you're going.
You know?
I mean and what the vision for your company is and Where you what how you want to change your community and the process that you want to take people through and how you want to solve their problems.
16:23
If you can paint that picture and believe it, people will believe you and then they will want to come with you.
So anyways, hopefully, that balance a little bit of in the trenches.
That's how we've always done it.
What flavor do you want?
And if you change the variables, you change the outcome.
16:39
Easy, easy overcomes.
What's your main concern?
Let's consider the options.
Those are all of the Very, very those things would be worn out if you can see them in physical space, like those would be worn out words that I've used many, many times to close sales, but at the end of the day, like if you just believe, they will believe you.
16:56
And a lot of times, you need to check yourself because most of us, know how to do the fundamentals of sales.
Right?
And so usually, it's just your own stuff.
That's getting your own way.
You had someone cancel, you had someone, leave a bad review you had you had a chargeback, you had a decline that's not responding to you.
In this person's been going to the gym for a year.
17:13
Right?
Stuff like that.
Stays with you write it.
But Tziu.
And so that's where you have to remove your emotions from the business and that's why business is hard, right?
Is that it's hard to do that.
It's hard to.
It's hard to keep.
Keep moving for keeping excited while also having the trash and the shit that you have to deal with, on the day-to-day basis of running a business.
17:31
So anyways, hope you guys have an amazing Wednesday, a Wacky Wednesday tag.
Somebody needs to get some in the trenches sales tactics.
They were five that I release on that call on this, this little podcast and I hope you enjoy them and use them to the betterment of yourself. and your clients be easy, but

Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
0:17
What's going on, everyone?
Happy Monday, hope you guys had a Mania meals weekend.
So we just got off the launcher identity meals, which went amazingly?
Well, just super proud of the team like Went off without a hitch, 18 months of prep and I'm just super excited to have that happen.
0:34
Now what I wanted to talk about was sales, right?
And this is probably the number one thing that I see that increases closing percentages.
And so, if there's anything that you ever take from any of the sales messages, this may be one of the most important ones, all right.
0:50
And it has to do with belief.
And what I mean by that is if I'm looking at a sales person and try to analyze, how they're doing, typically, I'm not going to start with the typical hand-to-hand.
Right, overcoming obstacles, the typical drilling that stuff's important.
And you have to have the fundamentals but it's not like once someone is repeated that they're an experienced salesperson or they sold plenty of times.
1:09
And you, if you're selling for your business, you have you probably know the fundamentals, right?
Or hopefully you should.
But the thing is, and the thing that happens is that you lack, this one thing and that one thing is conviction, right is belief that if the person signs up with you they're going to achieve a result.
1:26
Now here's where it gets really really tricky.
All right, it gets tricky. because, The.
When you're in a coaching business, right?
When you're trying to teach people how to get a result, right?
And that works with B2B, right, me trying to help Jim's make more money or when you're coaching clients on how to lose weight, right?
1:49
All of those things, you actually have no control and that's where it gets kind of tricky with this, right?
And what I see this happen.
A lot of times is that we'll have a you know someone someone signs up and and for Jim watch for example on Closing rates, actually really good.
2:05
And then all of a sudden it starts going down, which you think is counter because they got more reps.
They should be selling better not worse, right?
That would be the logical thing.
But what happens is not that their skills go down, but their conviction goes down because what happens is they start to see people who sign up and then don't get results.
2:21
All right, so let me give you a bit of truth about Jim launch.
Not every gym that signs up for gym.
Launch has a crazy transformation.
All right.
Not every person who signs up at your gym loses weight.
Why?
Because you can't control everything right.
Now you can do is show the zillions of people who have and they follow the process, and it work, right?
2:40
And so how do you mean team conviction when you know that a certain percentage of people aren't going to achieve a result, right?
And so what's interesting is that like I have like when I had my trainers, it was almost like this, rite of passage like until they saw the way out day and they saw person after person after person lose weight and be happy and lose weight and be happy and then all of a sudden like sales after a way out day, we're always Is like Sky High, why?
3:05
Because they believed it and they had just experienced it, which is why reading the testimonies the morning reading and reminding them why we do this is so important.
But here's the technique though, Beyond, just reading testimonials and being reminded of that is that you have to sell in your mind against the alternative.
Right?
What's the alternative of This person who's walking the door Susie, right?
3:25
Susie Susie is coming into trying to lose weight, you may know in the back of your mind, that there is a percentage likely that she may not have it, right?
She may not hit the goal.
She may not ever achieve the body that she wants, right?
It's possible.
You saw someone canceled last week.
You saw someone canceled this morning, right?
3:41
So how do you maintain that while also talking to Suzy me?
Like you're going to change your life.
This is where the discipline of sales is so important, right?
Is that you have to look at it by comparing the alternatives?
If she does not sign up, what is the likelihood that she is going to have her life change?
3:57
Probably significantly lower, if she goes to a non service-based facility down the street, what is the likelihood that she achieves?
The result?
If she goes and gets online program or if she gets a you know just like buys a course or anything like that.
4:13
All of the Alternatives such as what is the likelihood that she succeeds.
And so the best reframe that I can give you is this is your best shot.
Right, because nothing is guaranteed in life, right?
Like like I said, there are Gibbs.
There are gems who have not gotten results using your mom's right.
4:30
There are also shitloads of Ginsu have what separates that, right?
Same system, same process, right, what?
Separate the two, the person, right?
The person only they might be at a different stage in their life.
They might different levels of commitment.
They might have different levels of pain other things going on in life etcetera, right?
A supportive husband is supportive business partner, supportive, wife or whatever, right supportive staff.
4:49
That's be to be all of those things factoring in which You have no control over.
You can try to influence that person.
That is what your job is to coach is to, is to fill the gap between, we know that calorie deficits work and that you should exercise, like, that part's really simple.
5:05
All of the hard part is, how do I get someone to do that, right?
And knowing full.
Well, when you're selling someone that there is no 100% likely to success there, isn't it?
Just, it's just a fact.
So, deconstructing that the people who have the highest level of conviction, close the most All right, if you've ever seen someone and like, what if easiest way to think about this is, if you have someone, who's a friend of yours, who's an absolute fundamentalist in a religion, doesn't matter what religion is, if they're truly do, they're just so sold.
5:35
You see how hard they sell it?
And it's because of their belief, right?
And if someone super convicted like crazy convicted, at some point, you start to question your own beliefs.
You're like what is this person know that?
I don't know right because their conviction was stronger than yours and so that is why as a Skilled salesperson.
5:53
You have to know how to manage your own conviction.
That also means that if you know that you're doing everything in your power on the Fulfillment side right to achieve those results, then, you know that this person is sending front of you has the best shot at achieving their thing by working with you.
And so that way you can you can still keep your mind space in a space of absolute conviction will also addressing reality right which is that person may not actually cheated but it is still in their best interest and best shot to work with you.
6:22
Right.
So, what's interesting about this is that your language changes, the tonality changes, how you address things changes.
So, I was hired, I think I may have told a story before about side.
Again, I was hired to consult for a leads brokerage.
All right.
So they were selling leads to mortgage brokers Brokers and real estate agents, right?
6:41
So people want to buy houses and so they came in to help me.
I was supposed to help them script out the process better and then I was supposed to like that's the first half that in the second half to down.
So it's like one of the team and get them just outright And so they're expecting like, you know, Glengarry Glen Ross like always be closers like you guys talk like type of speech for me and it wasn't really that all kind of sat down and I was like, John, right?
7:03
Tell me how good of the liens, right?
And he was like, well you know they're short and I was like stop already know you've already unsold me because if you were belief right I was like imagine if these leads right were so hot that like every person of every one of these leads was gonna buy a house.
7:20
Well how much would your life change?
What would what?
Would actually change in how to do things right.
I was like you probably would be like shit.
Oh my God, like these real estate agents are making so much money.
These Brokers are making so much money.
So like my uncle Fred is a realtor so I'm sending him leads.
7:35
I'm buying leads with my own money sitting in to him and then we're splitting it.
I'm studying for my real estate degree so that I can start taking these teeth right now, so they're eventually, I can even maybe even get out of this job because like the opportunity is so big.
Do you see how how you speak changes because of your level of conviction for the thing?
7:52
Right.
And so, the script only matters, insofar, as the person who's delivering it in their ability to, to convict the other person of their conviction, because it doesn't matter if you are.
So, convicted other people will believe you.
And so, all of the hand hand combat sales, all the clothes are Frameworks on clarifying.
8:09
The paint, all of those things are just methods to have a conversation.
But at the end of the day, you being able to truly believe in your product and understand that the person in front of you, what is their alternative?
What is the likelihood of So there's Alternatives and understand that you are their best shot.
8:26
Then if you can approach the conversation with that framework, you have a highest like that is Success, right?
And that is what I look for in sales.
People is conviction, which is why some of the best salespeople for you will be X clients who've achieved amazing results because they may not have the, the the in the trenches sales experience.
8:43
But conviction will be experience and skill seven days a week if they believe right.
Now when you have to counter that with is not selling hot and over.
Promising, right?
And so I was talking to to my Carson from Wilder of the other day and he's a phenomenal sales person.
9:01
I mean, I think he's one of the best he's great and one of the things he did he's like after you close this you re closest to sell.
What I loved about this is he said, okay, now, you know Susie, I need you.
Ask me a question, okay with that.
Just like, okay, cool.
What's the question?
I need you to ask me.
What if I want to cancel?
9:18
What if want to cancel?
And you asked me out right now?
She's like, okay, you know what?
If I want to cancel Can't.
If you're a return listener and you have not rated or reviewed the show, I want you to know that you should feel absolutely terrible about yourself and everything else in the room kidding.
9:35
But it would mean the absolute world to me.
If you guys would go ahead and do that, you don't have to pause the show, you keep listening and you can just do with your thumb right now will take you less than 60 seconds.
And like I said, the only way that podcast grows through word of mouth and this is you joining hands with me and helping as many isomers of possibly can because no one is coming to save us, it's just us.
9:51
All right, so please go do that.
Now.
Let's get back to the shop.
Oh my God.
It's like they step back the like like what?
Yeah, like you can't cancel.
Like you just selected a year-long you know program and you're getting a discounted rate because of that.
10:08
So like obviously you can't get cancelled because that's why you're getting this this lower right to make sense like the only reason that you could cancel is because of like because you move, right?
It has to be 20 miles or more, but we also have an online program so there's really no reason for that.
So you can't cancel, it makes sense.
10:24
Because life is always gonna get away.
So you can't cancel because that because we have, This work, right?
That's why you're here, right, right.
Okay.
So what situation would come up where you think that you that you would, you would cancel, right?
Well, and like, and so you're overcoming the reasons in the future that they might consider canceling right and then you're like, Okay, cool.
10:42
So you'd understand that like if for some reason you came to me and said, like I'm going to cancel that I would send you the collections that makes sense.
And then they're like, you'd send me to collections and then his response is you wouldn't hold up your end of the agreement.
I'm like, oh yeah, and so imagine the expectations in the strength of that close compared to the soft weak ass closes that you hear all the time of, like listen.
11:06
And you know, if it doesn't look like it was canceling of you want.
And like, you know, even if you don't pay, we're not going to charge you like you're a meal.
Like like consider the difference in that person, the thing is is that if you confront it in the sale, you're still going to close.
They already said yes, right?
But they said, yes, they are getting these new terms that are that are cheaper because they're doing on a times that like make sure that you collect.
11:25
On them right now.
I've never sent people to collections, I never have.
But after speaking with him about this, I was like, man, that's actually really interesting and so I just thought it was absolutely awesome but that level of conviction that was there with it.
11:41
Just seeps through, it's like Susie like if you move away we have online.
If you get busy, we need to make sure that we can make this work because you're always going to get busy in life.
So that's not a reason.
Well, what if I don't have the money, will you have money now, right?
Okay.
Well, what are the things you spend money on, you spend money on clothes, you spend money on food, eating out.
11:59
You spend money on nails, coming on hair, do you spend money on, like, what are all the things going on?
A lot of.
It's okay.
So we can agree that you probably take this out because you didn't make a commitment to the Hair Company, ready to make a commitment to The Nail company, right?
You're making a commitment to me right now it's where you get this right to make sense, right?
So you can understand why we hold you to this, right?
12:16
Just like you hold it to me to fulfill my promises which I'm playing 100 idea to make sense, right?
And so if you want to increase your using percentages, right?
You want to increase your closing, you have to start with you, you have to look at the Alternatives that Susie has and think what other Alternatives she has besides signing up here.
12:35
She may not have 100% success rate because you don't have one.
I don't care what the fuck.
You say.
You don't have 100% success rate because of you are not the one who solely responsible for delivering the result.
You're not eating the food yourself.
You're not working out her body for her.
Then you don't have control.
I can't call the leads.
I can't sell for a gym.
12:50
There's nothing I can do about it.
I can't manage their team for that.
I can't see if their facility stuff.
There's nothing I can do about that but I had no, I do not have a hundred percent control.
I can only guide you right now, I can show you all the things.
All these other people have been successful have had right?
But I can say that the likelihood that you were successful with us compared to any alternative that you can present is superior.
13:11
And so if you want this thing, I'm I'm your best shot, how bad you want this, right?
And so your conviction will seep through and so if you need to check on your team, you need to check on your sales people.
What you need to do is sell them on why this is so important that they sign up with you because if they don't what are they going to go to the going to go back home, they're going to have a thing, ice cream and they're going to wait three more years before they get the courage up to do it again and they're going to be that much worse off because you didn't have the gall or the conviction to sign them up, right?
13:45
Because you started second-guessing yourself.
All right.
So as a business owner, you got to be able to take the good and the bad and still move forward.
All right.
That's part of the Late of being a business owner, which is why, when people start, they sell better sometimes than they do six six months in, right?
14:02
Because they've been beat up, right?
And so, you have the skill and if arguably even more skill.
But the thing that you missed the thing I went down as your conviction, right?
And so, if you can bring that conviction of the table, they will feel it.
The way you speak will be different, the tonality that you have and even the words, you say will change.
14:21
Because if you're looking at it, when this person walks in the door and I got I'm really urging you.
If you think about it as a sale you will lose.
All right?
You're like, I gotta sell this person.
Got to close this person.
You're going to your operating from the wrong mindset.
It's not going to work, but if you come in and you see, Susan, you think what was Susie's life before this?
14:38
Right?
She's trying to get to hear what is the likely to?
She achieves that doing anything but working with me.
Probably pretty low.
Okay, then it is my responsibility.
This is my duty because the coaching starts at the sale.
The coaching does not start.
Once they are sold the coaching starts At the sale.
14:55
That is where the expectations are set.
That's where you're saying, this is what you're going to do.
This is what I'm going to do and you can imagine how much more committed Susie is.
If I say asking if you can cancel, You can't because I'm not going to give up on you, right?
Because you have given up on yourself many times in the past, so give me examples of things that would make you think you would cancel, right?
15:17
Because we're in this, right?
I'm going to get you to that goal.
That is commitment.
I've made you.
So I don't see what life scenarios could come up, right?
Can't make you a dim.
Don't worry, we have online and remote can't like, you're moving away.
Cool, again, online and remote, you know, I'm super busy doesn't matter.
15:34
You're going to be busy again in your life.
I think you're not going to be busy, right?
You want to stick this for Life?
Yes.
All right.
You're going to assume you're not going to be busy for the rest of your life.
That's a lie.
Well there's holidays coming up right?
There's a vacation coming up you think that the rest of your life not going to go vacation of course you are right?
So that's not a reason to cancel, right?
15:51
And if you can address those things up front, you're actually being a good coach will also transferring the conviction that person that they have.
This moment where they're like, oh shit, this is going to work like they're going to follow through.
I'm actually going to get what I want which Someone to hold me accountable who's actually follow through with me, right.
16:09
The calorie deficit is not hard to calculate, right?
It's just getting them to do that and be committed.
And so if you can address that stuff on the front end, if you can transfer your conviction of the person knowing that they have no alternative that is better than the solution that you have in front of you, then you will be able to make them believe because you have to believe that.
16:27
And like the sail, is simply explain to them.
Why you believe that, right?
Like, I had some people like, how do I, you know, how do I, how do I sell meals?
There's a question.
Like how do you recommend nice leaves?
You probably are like, well, these are the knee sleeves.
I use I've used a bunch of them and these ones are the best like they're, you know, they're like you're not even concerned with the price.
16:46
We're talking to him, probably not the probably not the cheapest leaves of the ones that you use your probably use them, some nice ones.
Why?
Because they're better, right.
And so, you don't need to change the way you talk.
You just need to transfer and explain to them the same reason you believe.
And the issue is that some people don't believe, and they think the hand-to-hand sales combat, they think the closer framework is going Overcome the fact that they lack the conviction in themselves and what they provide.
17:12
And so you go dial in with your team, make sure your sits on point.
So that when you look someone in the eyes, you can say, I know and I can commit to you that we will try our absolute hardest to get you there and part of that starts with this conversation to see how committed you are fair enough.
All right.
17:27
Awesome.
And as a total side note, one of my favorite ways to close it saying, fair enough.
All right.
Why?
Because I got this inverted buffer.
Fair enough is not saying does this sound like the best deal ever know?
Because it might not be the best deal ever.
Right.
But if you're saying, does this sound fair?
17:44
Then it's the, it's the lowest level of getting someone to say.
Yes, this sounds fair, the sound reasonable.
Sounds reasonable.
Okay, but you got the, yes, and then you can close the sale based on saying, is this fair, right?
And then you're having someone who's less emotional more rational is making the decision and that is more likely to stick after the emotions of the moment have worn off.
18:04
All right.
So you're explaining, why you believe what?
Believe, and if you do truly believe it, then they have no reason to not believe what you do believe.
All right.
So conviction is the thing that you may be missing conviction may be the thing that your sales team, misses which is why you should read the testimonies them, which is why you should share the wins every day so that they believe as hard as you believe and they never will believe like you believe.
18:25
Because that's I mean, I hope not because if they believe more than you believe then you got some issues, all right, but it all starts with you.
So nice, have an amazing day.
Conviction is the key and I'll catch you guys on the flippy.
Keeping amazing and If you're, if you were tuning into all of our stuff with the meals launch affiliate dot Prestige, labs.com is where you can sign up to sell meals and become a founding member, which at you twice the incentive.
18:49
So you get twice as many meals for free which is pretty dope.
So if you want you and your trainers, all that stuff to get free meals, go do that.
You got to sell three people, your meals recover, pretty fucking bad ass.
All right, after that and it's going to double speed six people which is still fucking amazing but just for Founder's you get into that.
19:05
So affiliate .
Precedes labs.com and you can go side.
All right?
Be easy.
Love you all keep rocking.

What's going on, everybody?
I'm bringing some more books, but I wanted to say that, if you haven't checked out Hunter million-dollar offers, I would definitely suggest that you start there.
I've gotten some solid feedback and it couldn't be happier with its.
Number one ranking on Amazon for direct marketing and over 5,000, five star reviews.
So, thank you guys so much for that.
0:15
It's 164 pages.
I really can help you out.
It takes about four hours to get through, check it out.
On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
The audiobook is Lowe's, they'll let me put it on for it, so I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
Welcome to the gym.
See Grits podcast, we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
0:37
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
I am breaking lots of rules and making more participants on Monday because of feel it.
So one of the other pieces on my mind was about Max client value extraction, which is just a fancy way of saying how to get the most money from people who are coming through your business.
0:58
And ultimately, if you look at the difference, Queen small, business owners and Enterprise businesses, big large businesses, you know, multinational corporations Etc.
Is their ability to extract and provide value to end-users and typically they do this through a very choreographed process, right?
1:18
And so, what I want to do is give you an example of something that's not in the fitness space and then give you an example of what we have.
As a pretty refined process for upselling.
A sending customers in a pie Pipeline.
All right, so in most small business owners feel bad about selling people.
1:37
And that's why they broke and can't make money involved, right?
But hopefully, you're beyond that point and you're okay with selling things because that is kind of how business works, as long as your.
Yeah.
This is really kind of how business Works, don't have time to break the bleep on that.
1:53
It just is what it is.
So, if you were to look at like rental cars, right?
This is pretty you know, agnostics?
Just, you know, grabbing a Copy from out there, right?
And you look at the process.
They take somebody through, okay?
So when you're ordering online, you have multiple time for, they're going to try and one click up.
2:11
So, with the the online selling process mirrors, the in-person sign process, and they do it multiple times because with they have figured out is the one equation that I can tell you right now, for making money, which is the amount of Goodwill, you have times.
The number of times, you asked for a sale equals Revenue equals how much money you make.
2:29
Make right?
And so in a rental car space, you would go at you, you order online, you make your reservation, they try and upsell you a couple things online.
Maybe you say yes or no.
Whatever.
And then you come in person, all right.
Now I just recently rented a car because we were on vacation in Utah and so it was just for me, I was smiling the whole time was I just enjoy I enjoy selling processes what you know in general and see what they're doing.
2:55
And it was clear that the rep who was, who is selling us was she was brand new Right.
But even though she was brand new, you could tell that this one conversation, this one cross has had been just absolutely.
Like this is your job is to do these things and they made it so stupid.
3:13
Simple that anyone could do it, right?
And so as we're signing we're going through.
Right?
First question.
She asks, is hey, are you sure this is going to be a big enough car given, you know, hey, you might need boots or skis or bubble.
You sure you don't like a bigger sized vehicle, right?
So, right there, upsell number one.
3:29
Okay.
Now for the the gym owners are for the fitness, professional professionals, a general rule listening to this.
Like she just asked me if I wanted more right?
I didn't feel offended.
I wasn't like how dare you ask me if there's something else that I would like, I was like, huh?
Let me consider that.
3:45
Do we need another car?
That's bigger than the basic one.
Are we going to take me to a probably not?
I think we should be okay, right?
Upsell offer to never won.
Then next thing, that she says, when when we're going through this, just like so, Would you like the Standard Insurance?
4:04
Or would you like the minimum right now mind you they're both upsells.
I can always opt to say I'll take zero.
Take none of those things and take it on the fact that my MX covers for car damage because it does and so does yours.
But that was upsell opportunity.
4:21
Number 2 and the choices that you gave wasn't like she didn't say Do you want us to just add insurance onto your vehicle?
She didn't say that.
She was like, would you like the standard or do you like the minimum and the minimum quiet and most you're right now.
4:36
Just take the minimum right when in reality it's do not sell.
Okay, so that was up.
So number two, that happened and this is just in a matter of like a four minute conversation.
All right then and and let us like, she's like, I don't feel like dealing with the card.
If something happens, it's going to be.
I see she's like just get the freaking insurance and I was like, no.
4:54
And she's like, just get it looks like fine, right?
As soon as getting Insurance okay, which was an egregious ridiculous amount which was like I think it was like 20 bucks a day right now for insurance, most insurance is like $20 a month, right?
And so for them to charge that for that period of time is literally pure profit.
5:11
You're talking, like 98 percent margin on that money because the likelihood that it happens is 0, and you have to have recorded every single dent on your car, which is another Revenue opportunity, which I'll get to in a second.
Now, that was up.
So number two, and this is after we had all the upselling, Has it happened on the actual page during the ordering process?
5:29
This is just us.
Pick up the damn car that we already made the decision on right.
Number three.
Thank you, Artie Lewis right up.
So number three was.
Hey, would you like to just pre pay for gas that?
We don't have to worry about, filling it up, it's only 270 a gallon, right?
5:47
Which is the same rate or a little cheaper than what, the the gas was in the area at the time now.
She said it like that which is the way she was wish.
It's just the way she was trained to say but what they don't tell you is that you're prepaying an entire tank of gas, which means That, if you only use a third of your tank, you still paid for the entire tank of gas, right?
6:12
And so that upsell is, let's say it's a truck, which is what we ended up getting.
I think they actually the gives the truck.
Even though I didn't take enough salt, I gave it so setting this because they had too many.
I think it's a, it's like a 25 gallon tank times 3 dollars right there.
6:28
Was a 75 dollar upsell and we probably I think when we drove it back in, if you'd only used a third or maybe Take a gas and we actually drove a decent amount, right?
And so each of these things ended up being up so opportunities and it actually added a total of $400, I think to the, to the ticket for our, for our state, right?
6:50
All of these little things that they added on and I looked at it, I was like, you realize Ojeda $400 this ticket right now?
At this point, I'm okay with this stuff, like it's more just worth that not dealing with the headache, but the point is, is that you have to have a query.
We graph experience for upselling.
7:07
Now, mind you once I got to the car, I then had to Tau take your video by the way, quick hack is just take a video on your phone.
If your old car rather than try to like mark it on the thing so that if they do try and doing you can show the time and date stamp that the ding was already there.
And yeah.
Now what I want to do is now explain the process that most people have their gyms and why they don't make money, right?
7:27
Like if I had just the reason that hurts and budget and dollar and all these ones had been in business is because they understand the process.
This is the process.
Getting as much value from each client, that uses the the vehicle, right?
And the same degree.
It's also providing value because some people might not want to deal with filling up the gas tank, they might value their time.
7:47
Like we do, right and they might not want to have to worry about slipping on ice and getting it in the car and having to file with the credit card company.
You know what to do with it, right?
And then my value, having a bigger car like these are all things that some people might value.
And they know that on average X percent are going to take each one of these upsells.
8:02
And the more times they ask, the more money they make Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
8:20
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that, you mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
Right?
And in Fitness because we have poor views about money as a community.
8:38
We say it is bad to upsell people, right?
Which is stupid.
But anyways, now, in Fitness, this is the best process that I'm aware of up to this point.
When someone walks in the door at that point, is when you sell them service and you don't just sell them a membership, you sell it to their goal.
8:57
All right, so that means that someone might come in for a 28-day a six-week 14-day that's 12 week.
Oh whatever.
A referral for God's sake, right?
They come in the door and you're going to sell them to their goal.
You're going to sell them for 36 weeks or however, long.
You think it's going to help to take to, it's going to take to get them to whatever their goal is, right?
9:17
So, that's number one.
Most people don't even do that.
Say, we're like, just the people come in and they're like, hey, why don't you just do a free trial, right?
Like God, yeah.
Anyways, no wonder you're not making it was someone walks in you, sell them on that because that's one of the most excited that's when they're most Community wants and door.
9:34
Right now, that's if you just do that, you already head of everyone else.
All right, if you want to go even further right?
And be a really smart business owner.
The next thing you do is you should have a nutrition orientation, all right?
And this is where you talk to someone again.
You reiterate their goals, you read or write their pain, and then you onboard them with a good experience.
9:51
But then you ask them about their food.
And at this point you can upsell them supplements, right, and you can upsell them meals, so that they will have to like.
Now for some consumers, it's not going to be everyone, but you're going to know that.
Percent of people, you're an 80% of people going to buy at least two products for supplements and 1 out of 3 or 1 or 1 out of 2.
10:10
Depends on how good your salesperson is, is going to take one two or three meals a day off their plate, so they don't have to worry about it anymore, right?
And that's real value to the consumer, right?
But to the business, it's also adding multiple revenue streams and up stops like, think about that car company, write multiple revenue streams for them, was gas, right?
10:29
Insurance, the size of the vehicle, right?
Each of those things and the dense that That happen later.
When I write all of these things were different categories of Revenue that they were able to derive or provide value from and then extract value and return from the customer.
Right.
10:44
And for us as gym owners what else does someone bought, right?
You're going to buy gas.
If you use a rental car, you're going to buy supplements.
If you get into fitness, you're going to buy food if you get into fitness.
So she have each of these things.
Now, that's just upsell number to write the second orientation you have to up cells during that conversation.
11:00
Now, after that point is there, that's what it must be like.
I'm already done.
Already provided enough antibiotics check inside.
But no, there's more.
All right, at day, 14 or day 21.
Typically in that range is when you can actually meet again.
With the person establish how they're doing?
11:16
See provide more value in terms of goal setting and and really just looking back at their performance of this point looking at their attendance Etc.
And the beauty of this next meeting is that you actually have yet.
Another opportunity for upset, all right because there's really two scenarios are like scenario one is the person is Not getting the, the, the weight loss that they want.
11:36
They're not hitting the goals of the speed that they're looking for.
And at that point, you upsell them additional levels of accountability, right?
If you're at the gym.
So it's like, hey we're to provide one-on-one accountability for you.
We're going to be, I want to be in, I'm going to text you every day.
Make sure that you show for your workouts and make sure that you're doing your foodstuff and you can give them a deal for signing up today.
11:55
And that moment right now if the person is really happy, then they like you and will probably take whatever offer you give them at this point because there are Too thrilled with the results.
So either scenario actually works to your advantage because if they're struggling, now you can solve the pain and if they're succeeding, then you can have the Goodwill that you can Bank on to say, hey, this is if you're getting results on this.
12:17
Imagine the results are going to get with our more advanced program with a more with more accountability, more coaching Etc, right?
And so to recap, this the Quark is experiencing need to take some through, has to be multiple revenue.
Streams Hassett will many times in the dick face.
12:34
See multiple conversations because renting a car is different than signing up for training because you don't have to arm wrestle, someone to send it for rent a car, they have to do it.
Whereas at the gym you do often have to arm wrestle someone for 30 or 40 minutes to get them to become you know to make the decision to help with for themselves.
12:49
All right.
So sale.
Number one is going to be your service Dale where you sell to goal, not sell them a membership or sell them a try, but you silent send them all the way to the gone.
Just like that.
You take somebody who's going to be worth a trial and maybe not convert and you get them committed.
And now that 24 36 weeks at X right.
13:06
So now all of a sudden you have a 2000 or so which automatically sets you up as 2 times the lifetime value of the average gym or 3 depending on Stadium.
All right, then after that you establish two other revenue streams from supplements and food at the second consultation that you have which is for nutrition.
13:22
All right, great.
Now we have two more revenue streams that were kicking in then it D14 or day 21 depending on how you want to structure.
But in that second to third week, you're going to sit down with them again, and that upsell either more cup.
Annuity or high-level service.
If you want to hate you want to do somewhere private training center group, maybe that might actually help you advance faster might hold a little more accountable showing up.
13:41
Hey, dude do 101 accountability with me.
So you can actually do some of these workouts remotely all of these things are different ways of having a conversation where you get upset at different levels of service, right?
And so this experience this choreographed experience allows you to Max make sure that value from the customer and then if you want to be even sexier as a gym owner once a quarter, you're doing an entire campaign to your your whole list your current.
14:04
Customers and your list of past customers and reactivations to get them back in the door and upsell them into a defined period program, like a 28d belly fat blast or a, you know, a six-week challenge or big booty boot camp or a accountability challenge or oh whatever.
14:20
And guess what?
On the back end of that, you should have that continuity service set up so that they can stay and keep doing it and they're going to pay more to do so.
And so if you do that on a quarterly basis then it means that you're going to on a consistent basis.
Upsell the customers that didn't take the initial offers on the front end, right?
14:38
And so overall, after having your first service cell and then your supplements and nutrition sale and then you have your higher level of service upsell for semi-private, for one-on-one, for accountability for remote training, all those things on conversation, number three, and then you have on average on a regular basis, you kind of catch with a big net.
14:56
Anyone else who slip through the cracks, get them to bring friends reactivate, and that is the process of being able to consistently track map.
X value from customers and also provide value to customers which is how this whole game works, right?
And so right now, if you look at your business and you're like man, we only do one of these things or two of these things.
15:15
Well, then you're leaving money on the table and the good news is that all you have to do is implement it and you can increase your Revenue per customer without doing anything else in your business and you can make more.
So, anyways, I hope this was valuable for you, if you did like it, tag someone, or comments, or or leave kind review on the podcast, If you're listening and I hope you guys have an amazing day and implement this and don't be afraid to make more by providing.

Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
Welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
We talked about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Next up, we have Alex her Mosey the other half of the dynamic duo at Jim launch.
0:44
They went from zero to 50 million in 20 months and he's going to share his thoughts in 10 minutes and Alex 3, 2 1.
All right, who's pumped about sales.
1:01
Sort of Pumped about.
Okay, so quick question.
So I can cater this to you guys.
As I try to tell my team, sometimes I'm going to talk fast, you can just listen fast.
So who here has one person or less?
That would mean if you are selling doing the majority of sales in your company and your hand raised, okay?
1:17
So like half, okay, that's perfect.
And the other half of you have a sales team, multiple two or more, right?
Okay.
So the name of my lovely talk is going to be the closer framework, all right?
And so what I'm going to to do is break this up into two halves.
1:34
The first half is how you actually manage the conversation that should say work, you get the idea, close the framework.
And then the second half is, how you made is the sales teams, you can get Wicked consistent sales on a monthly basis.
So, first things first, who here has ever struggled with inconsistent lead, quality, inconsistent kak, right?
1:54
You're like, I thought I was at a thousand and now I'm at 3000, my leads our shit, actually, my leads are amazing.
My sales team is under work.
Now, they're overworked, they said, there's too many there's too few.
They're not being efficient, it.
Setters anyone with any of that stuff.
Okay, cool.
So I've run a lot of sales teams be to be weeded out to our sales company.
2:12
We would fly to Jim's actually self for them so we'd fill them up in 30 days with us.
Actually flying people out and selling.
So we've done a lot of sales and this is the simplest framework that you can use.
And so this is the first of the five Cs.
So I try to use Marcus is 5 C.
So when you go home, you got tense.
2:28
He's okay so the The first one governs, the conversation.
So that's kind of the for everyone who was raised in this kind of more of you over here.
Raising your hands about life about one person or it's me.
This is the governing framework for how you make the conversation.
See is you clarify?
Why the person is there?
2:46
All right.
Now, when you use this framework, everything that's in your framework, has to be a question.
Only do not put paragraphs, do not put statements, because they will start reading them.
They can't think that way only put questions because they can pause.
They can ask another question.
They can pause.
They can ask another question and they need no intelligence to do that.
3:04
Which means the scalable.
Okay.
So when you're asking so all of these buckets are the buckets under which you want to create the framework that you're making your sale.
So it's like what made you get on the call, what's your goal, why is that important to you?
What would it look like 12 months from now?
If this ideal outcome, we're doing, be achieved, right?
3:20
Those are the clarification questions.
Next, you label them with a problem.
So what I'm hearing is, you've done XY and z and The Missing Link has been X whatever is that right?
Yes.
Got it.
I now have a problem.
You know I have cancer I can cure it.
3:36
Alright next is 0 we're going to overview the pain, okay?
So I'm assuming I'm not the first person you've come to try and solve this problem.
So what have done in the past?
All right, I've done X y&z.
Why did that not work for you?
Obviously didn't work because they're on the phone with you.
All right.
So you always have the advantage because they're on the phone with you right now.
3:52
Sir overviewing past pain.
We call the pain cycle.
You do that until they have nothing left, and you're like awesome and then you recap the pain.
Then s you sell the vacation.
This is the only thing that your salespeople have to actually know.
4:08
This can be three stories that you're going to tell them, they're gonna be illustrative of the thing that you were helping them solve.
So an example would be Fitness your shin and Fitness Nutrition and accountability.
If I was trying to sell weight loss, right?
You're usually missing one or two or all three of these things.
That's why you weren't successful, right?
You couldn't consistently work out.
4:24
You can consistently the right way or no one was there to hold you.
Accountable to make sense.
Yes.
If you're selling leads it would be like you need your lease to be exclusive.
You need them to be Timely.
You need them to be.
Geographic, whatever.
Like you're going to find three things and they have to give a short 30 second snippet, why that's important, right?
4:41
If I was trying to illustrate accountability, I'll be like, hey did your parents ever tell you to brush your teeth me group, you probably hated it.
You're like, no, I don't want to and they can do it over time and I'll bet you brush your teeth now, right?
You need someone to hold you accountable, so you create the Habit, so make sense. 30, second story, they understand it.
That's how you sell a vacation.
All right, e-explain away their concerns away.
5:01
Concerns blah, blah, blah.
You get the point.
All right, that's where you're doing.
Aw.
Your option, overcomes, all right, crazy people, by without obstacles.
Normal people have concerns.
You need to overcome them.
These have to be drilled.
All right, they have to be drilled.
So that means that you have flashcards.
Like, I need to think about it.
I have to talk to my husband.
5:17
I have to check with my partner, I have to.
So there's only three by the way, if you don't know what they are, it's price, it's tall, it's decision maker.
All right.
So all you have to do is understand what each of those three are.
If it's price, it's a description discrepancy.
In value, they do understand the value.
If it's decision-maker, what you have to do is rely on Past agreements that are implied, that that person is already communicated to the partner.
5:40
So your partner knows that you're struggling with these things already, right?
They know that you're looking for a solution, right?
So why do you think they'd be a post with you solving the problem?
The journey know you have that.
They don't agree with gay guys.
Love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects more visuals, more graphs, you don't drawn out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
6:02
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, Right overcoming.
Okay.
Those have to be drilled.
Next one is decision-maker.
We did price and stall, right?
6:20
All you're doing is teaching someone to make a decision because people don't like making them because they fear making mistake, right?
Perfect.
Halfway through.
Why?
Okay, so what you're gonna do is walk them through decision-making process.
So how do we make decisions either?
Do you do you like me?
6:35
Yes.
Or no?
Do you like the product?
Yes.
Or no.
Do you think that we'll be able to help you achieve this outcome?
Yes, or no.
Do you have access to this amount of money in your bank account or know?
Someone who does yes or no?
Yes, What card you want to use, right overcome, you make them confront the decision.
6:51
All right.
What's your main concern?
Then they tell you my concern, you overcome it close.
All right, last one is reinforce the decision and I like doing this.
And we included it after time is that people back out, right?
So how can we slam slam it on?
7:07
How can we get them super pumped?
So immediately afterwards, that's the 30 second video from the founder be like, hey, just so you sign up for our software.
Super excited to have you by name personalized.
Edward and card t-shirt.
Any of those things, reinforce the decision, make the feet nice and hot make sense.
That's the closer framework.
7:23
Every single one of these buckets has to be questions that are simple for them to ask.
All right, so when you're organizing your script, this is the conversation we're going through that make sense to everybody, okay?
That is the first of the five Cs don't wear.
The other ones are are fast and about how you manage your sales team.
Okay?
7:39
Don't worry, I'll be fast.
So that's closer.
The next one is, don't worry, I'm rocking, we're good.
Okay, the next one.
Whoo, I should know these.
That's okay.
Okay, call recordings.
7:55
And then I'm going to, I'm just going to write these down real quick for you so you can write them down.
Comms.
Cut competition.
Okay.
So Marcus is much smarter than me.
I think he's like, the really classy classy person.
8:13
This is like from the streets closing, 4,000 people, one-on-one sales like weight loss, Susie's riding with, you know, her kids trying to write permanent marker on the wall and I'm trying to close your credit card.
All right?
So close.
The sequence is how you manage the framework call recordings.
If you're not recording every single fucking call that your people are on one or not compliant to you should do it because then they become more accountable to following the script.
8:33
All right?
You also overview those the tool that you need to use is gone.
If you guys sell via Zoom the fucking best, it's all I can say use Kong.
It's amazing.
All right.
Comms you need to talk to your team on a regular basis.
All right, the Cadence there is daily Huddle's weekly one-on-ones and when you do the, and then obviously monthly, but the daily Huddle's are quick, all you do is you share testimonials.
9:00
So they remember why they're selling so they get beat up every single day.
With knows, they need to remember why they're still doing it, all right?
From the 10 ones that you're doing when you're Meeting with them, you're going to record your going to have the tag you in three calls their best call their worst call on their average call.
When you go over in the 10 ones, you're going to ask them to show you where they clarified the problem, where they outline the paint and then where they ask for the sale and where they overcame objections.
9:25
If they never clarify the pain, and they've asked for the sale, you don't make money.
So that way, they always know that every fucking call you always ask for the sale.
You can never make a sale.
You never asked for it.
All right?
That's what you The communication, Cadence cut.
You got to cut the bottom.
All right.
9:41
It's the number one thing that will drive sales teams is by cutting the bottom 10%.
You do it on a regular basis.
It has to be on a regular basis.
All right, even if the team is going okay, when you cut the bottom, you'll see a 30% jump in productivity every time.
So if you can have a persistent 30% jump, why would you not do that?
9:58
That makes sense.
Okay, competition.
Last Point.
Whoo, I'm good.
I got a minute 20.
Okay so, Competition sales, people are competitive.
You have to have a leader board that is published that they can see every single day that they get notified.
10:14
When every other guy is making a sale, if it's super high volume, it can be end of day.
But when they, you've got a bell if you're in person, if you're not a person, you have a thread.
That should be all the sales guys, digging, they can literally send an image or a gif of a bell.
So it's like ring the bell, right?
So that they know, and this is volume that can see if there's activity.
There's action, right?
10:29
It's all of momentum.
So leaderboard that has to be checked.
Every day.
Has to be updated regularly, like that has to be on point.
And then competitions, we found that six weeks works, best in terms of sending them on like closers go to Vegas or go to Bahamas or whatever it is.
10:47
And so we put them in three men teams and that tends to work really well because that they share best practices that continue to work with each other, they root for each other.
So it's not it's Cutthroat, it's just always having Top Dog.
And in terms of how much to spend on that 25% of one month.
11:03
Check is usually the amount per person that a prize like that would be Be right.
So if you guys make 70 you might spend fifteen hundred bucks to send a guy for like a three day or like a two-day weekend.
It's not expensive 5 grand but it is worth every dollar so to recap if you want really really consistent sales use a closer framework.
11:22
Everything has to be questions do not have statements have 30 seconds stories record your calls.
Make sure you're sticking to the comp Cadence cut the bottom percentage and keep it competitive so they stay in it.
Thank you.

Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
Welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more percussive, Customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
0:37
Hey, what's going on everyone and happy 2020?
Hopefully have 20/20 vision going into the year 2020.
I wanted to do something that I don't think I've done since I've been a quote Guru or really shoot.
Even for that when I was a fitness Guru as in just a gym owner, not just a gem are but with my fitness clientele.
0:57
So anyways, I was reading So I have a habit of what I do is I take I write down my failures.
So this is something that I do.
I've done for a while.
I write down all the mistakes that I make and I do this on a regular basis.
So I have this ongoing email thread to myself of failures.
1:16
I think I'm like home fuck-ups but and it's just, that was a failure.
That was a failure.
And periodically, I'll go through and trying to take stock of, kind of all the failures and see if I can Figure out the lessons or principles behind them that I've learned.
1:32
And so I shared the list, I'm about to share with you with Layla this morning of I was like this is my 2019 kind of recap and she was like, that was really good.
You should make that into a podcast.
So this was at her behest, this is going to be more listicle than my typical stuff.
1:51
If you guys want explanations on any of the kind of points or lessons than just comments, and let me know.
And I will make individual podcast kind of Pounding on any of these individual notes.
So I broke this up into like business strategy, failures and lessons people failures and lessons relationships failures and lessons and then self.
2:13
All right, so the for the failures that I would say, 2019 brought for me, the first was you guys may not even remember this but bolt on which was basically supplements, only Secrets packages, as of cold cold front end, offer that Old and the lesson that I got from that there was to, it was twofold.
2:33
One, is that every product must solve pain, it cannot be an opportunity for game because people are irrational and they don't see $500 save versus five hundred dollars.
Earned is the same thing.
There are like 10 times more willing to save $500 and they are willing to make $500 more so bolt.
2:52
Aunt, that's lesson.
Number one, I got from bolt on was it has to solve pain all products must solve pain if they're going to be a massive success.
Next is that if you're selling something you can only break one belief, not to, if you have to create two beliefs of the product, it doesn't work what I mean by that.
3:10
Is if, for example, I mean, with both on the issue was, I had to say, hey, you should sell supplements, number one, if you were like, okay, that's the belief I can break like there's plenty of false beliefs are on just doing that.
And then after the, all right, got it.
3:26
I'll sell supplements that I was like, great here.
Species lives are like people, why should I say?
She's Labs.
So I had to sell two things.
The reason it worked in our communities, that people trusted me enough to say, okay well so Prestige because we trust Trevor, We Trust Alex.
And so then I only had to break one for my community but we know it's a coal traffic.
3:41
I need a break too and that's why I didn't work.
So those are two of the lessons that I got from bolt on hybrid.
Taught me a lot about messaging and so the lessons that I have from that are protect the core everyone hates change.
3:57
Everyone.
And those are probably my two biggest ones.
And so it's like speaking terms that everyone understands and doesn't get.
I thought I should shake the tree mix things up and it absolutely just like people lost their minds when it was indeed.
4:13
Just 101 nutrition and accountability.
So that was the lessons I had from hybrid with within Jim watch.
I had the launcher Prestige, that happened pretty much this time.
Last year, we also started increasing the amount of releases that we were doing within Jim watch.
4:30
We were a little less focused on acquisition.
So all of these are errors, I actually spent a million dollars creating an app that retains clients were about eight weeks away from being done.
And we've been about eight weeks away from being done, for six months and the reason for that is because no one gives a shit about retention.
4:47
So I I learned that that's why there's no retention agencies.
There's only marketing agencies, people cared about retention, they think they care over tents.
They don't actually give a shit about retention and so that Is a, an important lesson for me.
I think I focused a little bit too much on top line revenue this last year.
5:07
I mean, we did grow the top one.
I think our bottom line, stay the same between 2018 and 2019.
Obviously I read invested a ton into other Technologies things like that.
Like Alan that's coming out soon, don't feed meals etc.
Those are some of the mistakes I made there with new systems we didn't input data collection properly.
5:24
That was a big fuck up on my part and so we got Burns not knowing things soon enough.
That's how just do is way to way later than we should have found out my personal issue up at this one in personal and this probably the biggest error of all I would say just big picture is that I had three businesses which is literally the opposite of what I tell everyone to do is I had three businesses and that doesn't work.
5:54
It's very, very hard.
And so it was me trying to get three things and I have a lot of growth Juju.
I can grow shit, I'm good at that, but three was a lot.
And so now this coming year so I just gave you all the business barriers I'll rock through the lessons.
6:10
Right product has to solve pain.
Not being opportunity for gain you can only break one belief at a time.
Not too.
If you have to break more than one, it's not going to work.
Never break, Focus, get better at one thing.
Don't do more things.
Always protect the core.
Everyone hates change.
Everyone releases don't do shit.
6:27
More is less less, is more better as I asked meaning just make the same thing better.
We'll get you more than releasing more things.
Give people what they want, not what they need.
That was the whole mess up.
I had with retention versus acquisition.
6:44
Everyone wants acquisition when I started talking about retention my own retention, went down, as in like my attrition went up.
I lost clients when I talk to my retention and that was because people didn't care, I restate this lesson again, everyone wants acquisition, nothing else.
7:00
Otters to a small business owner.
I also think I the reason that the the hybrid messaging was so polarizing.
Is that at the time?
I think I was focusing on competitors a little bit.
So I was being reactive rather than just like remembering that we're like 10 times fucking bigger than everyone else.
7:19
And like, everyone else reacts to us, it was just stupid.
It was short-sighted with me.
The lesson also was just focusing on effort 6.
Redefining success is effort both for me for my family, for my team, as well.
And then the last lesson.
7:34
That we need to have a singular person who drives each business entity.
I can still be, like, chairman of the board.
So to say, but like we need one person who drives this one person to drive system.
That's all they think about.
We can't have people cross, you know, cross-departmental cross entity because it just gets too confusing.
7:52
People can't focus on two things.
Chase two, rabbits ride, two horses, have to serve two masters, whatever the saying is so that was my, those are my, my failures on the business front this last year.
Those are some more lessons from it.
I'm not going to tell you about my people failures, but I'll tell you about the lessons.
8:10
Obviously, to protect the people, these ones are a little bit shorter, but a little punchier, only hire people to do things.
They've already done, that's lesson number one, otherwise they're just learning on your dollar and the higher up, you go.
8:26
The less acceptable that is because when someone fucks up at a sea level, it's pretty big.
When someone fucks up at a Director level, it's pretty big.
And this last year, we were placed 10 out of our 11 directors.
So yeah, we took people from Frontline.
8:44
Move them all the way up to doing positions, they've never done before and they made mistakes, that no one should make.
And I'm glad that we were able to give them that opportunity to learn on our dollar.
And then they will probably be able to go somewhere else and not make the same mistakes.
And then that business owner will be better off.
So happy for them.
9:01
Never get too far away that you can see the problems.
Or so.
If you ever feel like an apartment is or like a section, your business is just crushing it, that it means you're too far away because there are always bodies.
So you have to know where the bodies are buried.
If you don't know where the bodies are buried, at there's more bodies than you can even imagine, you have to always, you can never be too far away that you can't see problems.
9:25
The next lesson was, don't shelter a star.
So, if you have a star employee and you start having to make processes around them because they're really good at one thing, but they suck at everything else.
Um, a lot of times that ends up changing a lot of the organizational structure around this person and that ends up backfiring on you and I've had that happen twice this year three times this year shit.
9:47
So do not shelter a star one, was it just a lesson on the clarification of the boss, right?
So, the job of the boss is three things motivation, training and communication, all right?
So communication to tell them, what exactly what you want, so that they understand what you want and then after they understand, What you want to have happen.
10:05
It's literally just two things, motivation and training.
And so if you are the boss, then your your time feel like, what should I do?
If you're not motivation, if you're not motivating, your team, training your team or communicating what you want done, then you're not doing the job of the boss, right?
10:20
So that was just a really good Clarity point for me, another was fire for ego.
So as soon as you see, ego obviously, try not to hire, if you see you go, but if you start to see you go, flare-up ego, does nothing good in the Ever people become entitled, they feel like they deserve things.
10:39
They always feel like they're not getting their due.
They're always trying to push other people down.
Trying to take credit when it's not 100% them.
They will put other people down in order to be viewed as more successful, which means, the team suffers.
And it's not about people, it's about the team, and so, if you see ego, just save yourself the headache and fire just save yourself, the headache, the next to our Fun ones, everyone will fuck you, everyone protect yourself and I purposely made that one a little bit strong.
11:12
And that's because we're human, you know, we want to have relationships in general but whenever you have money that comes between two people, then the dynamic of the relationship changes and everyone will always act out of their own self-interest, which is the kind of the next lesson.
11:29
They go ahead and hit expect people to act out of their own self-interest and evenly into It?
So lean into people selfishness and then you will never be surprised.
And I'm usually pretty good about this, but I'm still keeping to.
And so that goes for everyone that goes for clients, it goes for vendors, it goes for employees.
11:48
If you have a paycheck that separates, you expect, that they will always act in their own self-interest, always, all ways, all ways they will never not act in your best.
12:04
Like you just have to do your best to align your interest and there's so that it makes them feel like they're being good people by helping you.
When in reality they're just helping themselves which is fine.
Just don't expect people to do otherwise.
So those are my lessons from people relationship, this is just specific the Leyland.
12:21
I the filler that Leyland.
I had this last year, is that laying are spent too much time together?
Like we spent all day every day?
I mean, we've been doing it for last four years together.
And what's interesting is that if you study Study couples Layla does a lot more than I do and she's better at it.
12:40
They basically found out that if you, there's the kind of like three Dynamics, right?
You can have one person who works and one person is at home.
You can have both on the Other Extreme.
You have both people working together in the same business and you have the middle Dynamic is like two people working towards shared, big picture goals, but in different, you know, verticals.
13:04
Different businesses like to Executives Etc.
And so it turns out the either of the extremes is kind of not the best scenario for long-term happiness, which is interesting on the extreme where like one person's at home.
On person's now obviously any of these situations can be good, these are just averages.
13:24
All right, based on subjective.
Well, being reported by couples.
It doesn't mean you are going to be unhappy if your wife doesn't work or whatever, just like before the, for the crazy start coming out.
Just understand this is data.
All right, so put your emotions away.
All right, so if you're a person one person's at home will persons working.
13:42
What happens a lot of times is that people start growing apart, your realities are so different.
Now that's good for the wrote.
Like you can have more chemistry and romance because you're so far apart.
You can be strangers which is why sometimes, from a social standpoint that can be a good thing.
But sometimes from the comfort standpoint it's like we have lived in six different realities like you don't understand what's going on in my life, right?
14:04
Right on the Other Extreme.
If both people are the same in the same business working together, this outcome out of all 3, tends to have the best monetary outcome.
You make the most money.
These people make the most money out of all three scenarios.
When two people work in the same business together.
The problem is the opposite is that you're incredibly comfortable, because you see, you are familiar, you see each other all the time, you share the same reality, right?
14:27
But at the same time, it makes it really difficult to have distance.
And distance is what creates friction and Strip right romance etcetera.
And so now like obviously Layla and I are not going to be getting out of business, which is why I said, if you take these three things don't get like crazy on me.
14:45
So what we're doing is that we are separating our roles that we can actually focus on different business entities, within our larger business.
And that way, she can really kind of BC of one part of the business, I can be CEO of another part of the business and that way it's like, well, how was your day today?
15:00
You know, I mean in, so we have the same end goal, we still work.
And have respect for the fact that one another work and I respect for her skills, just respect for mine but we're not, we don't have sex shared context, that everyday is obviously the same.
Like, you don't need to tell me what happened today at dinner, because I already know because I was there with you, right?
15:17
And so then that it's like when you're like, I don't know what we should say to each other and so that was like a big lesson for us.
And so, so we spend too much time together.
We didn't spend enough time with friends.
These are all kind of under the same bucket.
We didn't have enough like fun time.
I think we could have done a better job of that.
15:34
At and I think personally or we together have evaluated every relationship based on monetary Roi, not life Roi.
And so like, I only hung out with people that I felt, like, would increase my skill set provide context, be good for my network Etc.
15:55
Rather than other benefits, that people can provide, right?
I'm just being really honest with you.
Those were the failures.
I had Hey guys, real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
16:11
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 million-dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers, make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward, slash leads.
It's for free in exchange for your email so that I can email you when we launched under leads and so that you can not miss out.
16:31
Out on it because last time I sold out for like eight straight weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
And so, the lessons from the was just one is the dichotomy of comfort and distance.
So people try and solve the problem of the relationship when it's like trying to solve Justice and mercy, they're both right.
16:50
And you have to walk the middle path.
It's trying to solve delegation versus Marco management.
You can't solve the equation.
You have to try and balance that.
So the same thing with relationships, right, for us to kind of me being super Comfort, super comfortable, super familiar and being super distant.
17:07
Super far apart.
You need both right?
It's good to miss someone and have that opportunity to miss someone because the distance is what creates variety of kits.
Spontaneity creates friction and creates mystery, but you also need comfort because you can't just constantly have mystery and spontaneity because your life would be chaos especially if you run a business.
17:28
And so it's being able to balance those two things.
So, it's a big major lesson underneath of that is kind of the alter ego effect, which is a book I don't have a next to me, but essentially you can't just Have one Persona and this was also a big failure of - felt like I was all work all the time which meant that like I never took my work hat off a lot of times and that makes romance difficult and so you kind of end up just going through the motions because you're like we have to do these things rather than like really being present and so really focusing.
17:58
Ironically on splitting up your egos like you're not you go from a price standpoint but you go from a personality standpoint.
So like You've got your work hat, you know what I mean?
And then you've got your husband hat and then maybe you have your like sexual weird hat, it really like because I think there's a great joke and analyze this.
18:18
Anyone remembers that movie with Robert De Niro and Billy Crystal he's like wait Billy Crystal's talking to Robin here.
Who's like a mob boss?
He's come to him as a shrink.
He's like wait your girlfriend is like yeah, it's like can't do that.
I can do things with my girlfriend.
18:33
I can't do with my wife.
It's like wait, what?
He's like.
Yeah.
Like I'm not gonna do things like that with my wife.
He's like that's the mouth, the kisses my my kids to sleep at night and what are you a pervert and stuff.
And so it's obviously hilarious.
But what he says like mix some sort of rational sense and it really kind of delineates that concept of like we need to we need to be these different people because like you have such respect and love for your wife and maybe maybe maybe in some typically in like not to get super weird sex stuff but if you like look into it typically people want the opposite of what they have in their normal Life in their sexual life.
19:09
And so it's like complete opposite type desires.
And so it's so counter to what that person is to you.
A rough what that person represents us.
Sometimes you have to occupy like a different mental space and that's where like role playing all sorts of fun.
19:24
Stuff comes into play, but anywho, I'll get you far too that.
But the point is just that having different ego separated and being clear about who those people are and the values you have, and how you act can, I think it'd be beneficial And the third lesson I had from relationships is just cut, this is a little bit kind of a general in but the diminishing return of money.
19:46
What I mean by that is like the more money you make, the less the money matters to you.
I can maybe just share this with you.
It just doesn't it just stops matter.
I remember when I was a kid there was a there was this article that I read about a guy who got a burger, right?
20:05
That was a 50,000 dollar burger.
Which is kind of crazy to me because I was like a fifty thousand dollar burger and it was some Finance dude.
And I remember thinking to myself, if that guy makes ten million dollars a year, the relative cost of that burger that was a 50,000 dollar burger was more, I'm sorry was less than the relative cost of a McDonald's burger for me at the income that I had at the time and then all of a sudden things became really real.
20:31
For me, I was like, wow, it's like you just need to make more money because there's so many more zeros on that side of nothing.
Then there are on the opposite side of nothing.
Like, you can only go to 0, obviously can go in debt, but like, most people don't know how to get in the millions of dollars that if, you know, how to get millions of dollars a day, then you already know that there's diminishing return of money, but for most people, zero is about as low as you can go, but you can go infinitely high.
20:54
And so what's cool about that is that like money means less to you as as you have more of it and to the same degree, you get an increase return of using it.
Meaning Since it means less you can do more with it.
21:11
Like when when you ship like rich people do crazy things, they don't really do crazy things.
They're humans.
They have a different context or reality and so it's like, if you could reorganize your entire house for five dollars, right?
Would you do it?
And would you do it seasonally for five bucks?
21:30
Probably.
Now, what imagine if you had enough money that the relative income are relative amount of time, it would take you to make that.
Money was the amount of time, it takes you to make five dollars.
Now you probably would do it and then people would look at you be like, man.
Rich people do crazy things.
They just blow their money on stupid shit.
21:47
We're out.
Is it just?
It's so insignificant in comparison to the amount of Total Money, you have that it stops really being meaningful.
And so you really get an increased return of using it because once you have so much there's really nothing else you can do with it, right?
22:03
So those are kind of that was I put that under relationships, that probably goes.
Yourself.
The last bucket is self as things that like I've learned first.
Is that you create sex success with skills, you sustained success with traits and you grow success with beliefs.
22:25
And that's been one, that's been very true for me in terms of myself.
But also in what I see in other people's in the beginning, you just don't have any skills that you need to be able to learn how to do things.
But once you learn how to do things need to be able to have the traits, the personality traits of patience of consistency that allows you to continue to execute those skills that you already have in order to sustain the success.
22:46
But once you sustain the success, then you have to re-break beliefs that you once had in order to grow that success even more, that's the continual process that you have to do for myself.
I have to have guy friends.
I'm a guy friend, dude, I need to have that in my life.
23:02
Personally, I go nuts without it super Big expectations leads to unhappiness.
And so, I had to keep myself in check and realize that my expectations are so high, that there's virtually no outcome that I would be happy with that actually happened with our meals launch, I actually still don't know.
23:20
I know we're doing really well with it, but I don't know the actual numbers because I got asked by my team to, like, do you want to see the numbers?
And I was like, I thought about it and I was like, there's literally no number.
You could tell me that would make me happy.
And so I just said, no.
And so right now I'm operating, this interesting space.
23:36
Where am I?
Actually judging myself based on how much effort I'm putting forth for that side of the business rather than the outcome.
And it's actually incredibly freeing, which is really cool for me.
So that's the the expectation side.
So you need to like, check yourself as like is there like before you find out news or what you think would happen actually think.
23:57
Like what like would any number really make me happy and if you if you find out to yourself, there really isn't one then maybe just judge yourself on effort.
Might find it kind of nice.
Now, in that same vein, I had a big breakthrough with my, my family this year.
24:15
I feel like I forgave my dad in a very true sense because I stopped judging off of what I perceive to be outcomes of parenting and rather started judging based on intention and effort and was like, did this guy, try his absolute fucking hardest.
24:35
To do the best.
He could given the cards.
He was dealt and I could not in any Universe.
Say that he did not try as fucking best and as soon as I realized that, I was like then, who am I?
You know, I mean to fucking judge and so I, I've switched, I switched how I judged relationships based on effort not outcomes and it's been unbelievably fruitful for me.
24:56
And so I highly recommend doing it.
If you have some that you've harbored resentment towards anything like that, it's been incredibly powerful for me too.
To use that.
And so I've really reapplied that lens that frame over and it's been really great and interesting one for me.
25:15
In terms of expectations again is in terms of how to run my life.
So the last four years has been 100% all-in on building gym, lunch, and all the associated entities and we've made a tremendous amount of money.
25:33
I mean, I mean a tremendous Of my and in realizing that there's actually no incremental increase in money.
That would make any difference in my life whatsoever.
Like Layla got me for hats for Christmas.
25:48
Which told what $120 that were custom made each have was 30 bucks and that was my Christmas gift and I was pumped you know super happy to have it and Layla and I live on sevenish I think the highest If we had was nine thousand dollars a month and we make that and usually about an hour a day, so it just doesn't really make any sense.
26:14
And so I've tried to reframe like just life in general for myself of like if I could like because no incremental increase in money is going to make a difference to me.
So that means that no one year's worth of extra profit is going to really change my life in any way.
And so the only thing that would really change my life from a monetary standpoint would be selling the business but I don't see the I think in the immediate future and so, maybe taking that out and saying, like, if I could never sell the business and I always, you know, operated this entity for the rest of my life, how would I run it and have life that I want?
26:53
And some of you might be like, well, duh Alexis like well yeah I mean I'll be the first to tell you what my what my limitations are and so the last four years, I've been 100% all-in.
I worked every pretty much every hour of the day that I could.
And I work until the point where I felt like, I had diminishing returns in my effort and that I would recharge and then work again.
27:10
And I've just pretty much done that cycle.
Well, I say for four years, but it's really been the last decade since I was 19.
So 11 years.
And so I think I'm entering into a different feels like I'm entering into different chapter of like how can I buy structure the business so that it's more sustainable, I don't do as much.
27:30
I do more of the directing and really Empower other people to do.
So it's kind of the gear that I feel like I'm getting into, is finding the leaders who can run the individual.
It's just like I was referencing earlier and they can drive growth in all three.
And then I can kind of just cast the bigger vision of like we're we're going as a company.
27:47
We're like how we can help the most people and all that kind of stuff.
And I finished my little section with the mottos of 2019 that I thought I'd share with you.
You probably have heard them.
One is success is the best revenge.
28:04
So whenever you See people talk shit about you, your client, your employees, or people fuck you, because they will, if you're a business, it's inevitable.
And it's not because they hate you, or they're militia.
It's just because they're just acting their own self interest in your interest is not aligned with theirs.
And so the only way to have a fruitful outcome that does not screw you in a long run is to just succeed.
28:27
It's all you can do.
I've played out every scenario like the only way you win is just by succeeding and making them irrelevant.
That's it.
I think that's all there is.
You can't lash out.
You can undercut because that hurts you, you can't, you know, poison yourself with anger because it only poisons you not them.
28:44
You can't spread negativity because that gets associated with you.
Like it just there's nothing you can do besides just succeed and do better.
The next is don't be cute.
That was kind of gone.
Pretty viral in our communities like just don't be fancy.
Don't try and reinvent the wheel.
29:00
Just keep doing the boring work which is the next motto which is In your reps, in putting your time, under the bar, just a total assets, a volume game, like life is a volume.
He go on more dates.
You can finally find the girl that you want.
You take, you know, you tell, you know, you do make more tax.
29:16
You make more calls.
You make more sales, you make more have more sales appointments and will make more sales like right?
Like the more you do something, the better you get at it.
So don't be cute.
Don't think you're going to out fancy outsmart success, it doesn't work that way.
Like you just have to put the fucking time in speed is King.
29:35
That is somewhat self-explanatory, like you gotta move, gotta keep moving and just endure, right?
Like you'd like you cannot lose if you do not quit.
So that is also one of the mottos.
It's like you can't lose an infinite gain.
29:50
The only way to lose the game is to stop playing and so, if you ever feel beat down, have to just remember that, like, you only lose if you stop play.
And that's been incredibly comforting to be in darker times, And just a big one.
30:06
For me to wrap this whole thing up is that some of these lessons that I shared or lessons that I know better and yet I still make mistakes.
And so I think a lot of times myself very, very much included.
I need to be reminded not taught there, very few new things.
It's just when you reminded of the things that we already know.
30:23
In the lessons we've already learned so with that.
I hope some of the lessons in the failures that I shared with, you were useful.
I hope some of the relationships of the business stuff, some of this.
Stuff of maybe one or two of those things, maybe resonate with you or you find Value in.
30:40
But anyways, those are the lessons and failures of 2019 and I am not sure about how like I've never been at goals guy.
Ironically, I've just been like, a learn from my lessons and keep doing the best I can.
And if I learn more lessons than my, the best I can, I will get better.
30:59
And that is worked.
Well, because I can just said, like, I want to help the zillion people like I just don't know what that's going to change on my daily basis.
So if I focus on anything, it's just on the habits.
And the actions.
I'm going to take and actually scheduling them out of my calendar.
If I want to read more than just put reading in your schedule if you want to work out more boat working out in your schedule and just stick with your schedule, you know, just do that.
31:22
So anyways, hopefully 19 is sorry. 2020 is awesome for you guys.
I'm super excited about what's to come very, very excited.
I learned a lot of lessons and despite all of the failures that we had, We still grew by 50% 2019 compared to 2020.
31:37
All right, sorry 2018 so all that to say like you can fuck up tremendously.
And still win as long as you just keep moving for.

Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out, if that's what you are into.
0:16
And if not keep enjoying the show, Welcome to the gym Secrets podcast, we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
I want to tell you a story about something that happened recently.
0:33
That was impactful for me and was just another one of the, we need to be reminded more than we need to be taught lessons.
It happened this Friday, on our Legacy release call.
And so if there's you don't know like every other Friday or so I kind of release new stuff, trainings information, whatever towards and was community and the last it's a month and a half, maybe two months.
0:58
I've been trying to Across this one point which is the importance of availability for making sales.
Simply put I mean it right now because we have so much data support this like the number of hours and number of time slots per day that you have and the number of days that you are available to take sales.
1:16
Appointments is a massive impact on your throughput of marketing.
What I mean by that, is for the amount of eyeballs clicks that turn into customers.
Write throughput.
They have to go through all of the steps in your sales process.
Right from click to opt-in.
In to apply to schedule to show to close right all the way through.
1:34
Like that's throughput, right?
And so availability.
And don't want to tell you the story about how like, how this came to be.
But I've been trying to get our gyms to increase their ability, like you need to find a way to be available more times.
1:49
Like if you're only available for three hours in the afternoon, four days a week yours not going to make that much money.
Like I just like, I'm like, I don't know how to say this different, right?
And I can't really banging my head against the wall with this summer.
Why is no one getting this?
I'm like, guys, you're gonna have three times as much money if you just have full availability, right?
2:06
People like you know, I don't know man.
Like you just hang it high right?
Just like just dragging ass and I was like, what the fuck like why are you not doing this right?
And so this last Friday I framed it differently and I had a huge response to it and I tons of people must means as a result.
2:23
When I said it, I felt like it hit, right?
And the difference was for the last month basic or two months.
Been trying to talk about how much opportunity was being lost, right?
How much opportunity for games, like I should get a three times, how much money you're making?
2:38
Like you're going to go from having, you know, 15% your lead show to like 35, 40 % your leech.
Oh, it's a massive difference, simply by having tons of availability for people's self schedule, right?
Because they're a more likely to schedule and be more likely to show the times more convenient, and I have the data to support that now because we've done this across, you know, 100 plus locations and we've tracked appointments Correspondingly, two different levels of availability, right?
3:03
There's a whole bunch of other factors too, but this was a really big one, right?
And so, in framing it, this last Friday compared to other times.
I've tried to bring this up with people, I said it differently when I said it, I thought everyone change.
And what I said was guys, you're you're wasting two thirds of your ad spend, right?
3:23
And like instead of spending nine thousand dollars a month on Advertising.
I was like, you can spend three now, the same amount of people Open your door and I was like, so that's six thousand dollars a month.
You be saving right by not having but by Just Simply Having better availability, like you have this much availability, you're going to save thousands, right?
3:42
You're going to not overspend on your acquisition by by 3x, right?
You're overspending to a Car customer.
It's costing three times as much to get someone in the door as it should.
Right.
And so now they make that may seem sudden to you but when people saw that they're like holy shit I'm spending three times as much.
3:59
I'm Spending three times as much as I could be spending on Advertising, like, literally.
Oh my gosh, I just been a third of what I'm spending now to get the same amount that is what clicked for people.
And the difference was up to this point, I was talking in the terms that I understand, and I'm going to talk the second half this little content piece.
4:16
I want to talk about this, but it's I talked about the opportunity for gain.
So guys, if you change nothing, you makes three times as much money, right?
No one gave a shit, right?
Because humans don't think an opportunity for game, right?
4:31
I'm still making the same fucking mistake, all right, talking like this, because I told you in my 2019 lessons that people by pain, not gain, right?
And it's continually to being reinforced for me, all right?
And so, I only talked about the opportunity for gain up to this point and then stead after that, it was about the pain that was being solved, right?
4:56
About the pain of overspending on acquisition about how much they could.
Save right?
And that's just because humans are illogical and they only think about pain avoidance.
They're so much more pain avoided than they are Desiring for game now.
5:12
Like that was the, that was the big shift in messaging for this last Friday that if you have to, if you're trying to communicate to someone to get them change, try and talk in terms of pain avoidance not opportunity for getting not talk about how much better their life's going to be but talk about all the pain, they're struggling through now that they won't have to have.
5:33
Right.
If you talk in those terms, they're going to be far, more likely to receive the message and then act in accordance to that.
All right so huge breakthrough for me right?
And hopefully for our Dream which Munich is if they can actually change the freaking availability, then they could save two thirds of the requisite across.
5:49
They wouldn't have to burn two-thirds of their ad.
Spend every month on Lee's that should be a walk in the door to just hit a scheduler.
That doesn't have available that they can make, right?
So that was kind of the first.
Staff.
Emo's a nation quick break.
Just to let you know, we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
6:08
Alright.
So send me a connection request.
A note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
The second half is kind of the fallacy that most business owners make because their human right.
6:30
Like most of our, you know, our growth is entrepreneurs is just unlearning who we are and learning that happens anyways, an opportunity for game and an opportunity for saving write or paint avoidance whatever you want.
You want to throw out there are equal from a mathematical standpoint and so you have to disproportionately away opportunities for game, right?
6:54
Because if I can make an extra thousand dollars a month, it's the same as meet taking effort to save three thousand dollars a month.
It's the same provided the the cost of those things.
From a Time standpoint is the same, right?
And so the cost of three Xing your throughput is the same.
7:13
You have to open this availability, what do you have to do, right?
But if you have to frame it to yourself that you're going to save 2/3.
It's not a very big growth mindset because for me, I'm like, I can triple how much money I'm making.
But some people just wanted to stay the same and then save more money, right?
That's what most people did.
And so, the fallacy is a business owner is not falling into that trap and being able to see opportunities for gain and pain avoidance in the same light as simply math, right?
7:39
Like if I can save you three thousand dollars a month on rent, it's the same as me setting up an affiliate relationship with you so that you can get, you know, affiliate commissions on everything that the people in your community already.
Bye.
Bye.
So now it's no operational complexity and either way but adding three thousand dollars a month of profit, right?
7:58
That doesn't have any operational.
Complexity is the same as me, getting three thousand dollars a month, knocked off your rent, right?
But if I set it that way, three thousand dollars a month, knocked off your red, like all you have to do is just like put these signs up and ask these questions in your landlord is going to knock off three thousand dollars a month in rent.
8:14
People were like hell, yeah, let's do it.
I'm stoked right versus doing the same setup to make.
Dollars a month, more right and they don't do it, right?
So you have to check yourself and I do this all the time for me, not an approach.
You ever saying like Making sure that you're not letting your emotions, make the decision and just letting the math guide you, because, as long as the operational complexity of putting any intervention in is the same.
8:41
Then, you should simply look at it in terms of how much money it could swing in either direction, right?
And so that is my, that is my big, my big takeaway from this last Friday.
I had a bunch of gym owners message me being like, Oh my God, that's made so much sense.
I feel so stupid for not just having better availability because they were like, no, I'm just going to take the time to the convenient for me and like, When you realize, if you can just set every day from nine to nine as available and then only block off the one or two times, you know, you can't take someone just doing that right starting as the default of full availability and then only changing the the couple of times that you know for a fact that you cannot meet with someone, right.
9:21
If you just do that, you can take your schedule rates from 40 to 60 percent, which is a 50% increase in throughput just from that.
And then on top of that, take your show raised from 40.
To 60%.
All right, I just have the data to back this up and so you think about how much how much does it cost you to do that?
9:39
Not a ton.
And if you're like, well, I'm outside of the business, then how much would it?
Like, would one one extra person who's working, part-time, be able to buy you back, triple your return on ad spend, and then you extrapolate that over a year because everybody thinks in a one week time frame like come on, right?
9:56
Think about this, if you're over 3x, right?
So here's we talking about it in terms of gains that if you're going From 10, new clients, a month to 30 new clients, a month simply by opening your availability month to and month 3 and month.
For that shit Stacks, right?
It's stacks and then it becomes irrelevant from a cost standpoint, right?
10:15
But from the pain avoidance, I'd I'd say.
Like if every month you have to spend 1/3 this amount of money that you normally do to keep your business, the same, how much more money is that in your pocket, right?
So instead of spending nine thousand a month on ads, you can spend three, you can take the extra six and put your pockets.
10:31
At least something thousand a year, whatever, 72,000 year that you can save, right?
And by save, I mean that's direct to bottom line, right?
If you're like the average gym that runs on 12 percent.
Gross, more are 80 percent ibadah.
Right Oprah said take home then 76 or 72 thousand dollars a year is a lot of money, right.
10:48
Just by opening the availability up in order to increase your throughput of all of your marketing, right?
And also just be kind of like a business, like 7-Eleven, like, you don't have to always say, you have to sell all day.
You just have to be available to sell. 7-Eleven doesn't have to have customers in their doors at all times.
11:08
In fact, I'm sure there's been plenty of times you've walked into a 7-Eleven, or a Royal Farm or Wawa or whatever is in your neighborhood, right?
And walked in there was no one there, right?
But they were available to take your business, right?
And so, to the same degree, especially in the Fitness World, we have to operate on off hours, a lot of times because the clients that we have, hopefully many of them work normal jobs from 95 and I see gym owners who only have availability from 9:00 to noon.
11:31
I'm like, well, who do you think's going to come in right?
You know, I mean, we're like they don't take any appointments after five.
Cool.
You don't have to do it but your business does running your business needs to have that availability like, well, what I do right now, it's like, well then you need to like, you opened a business and so you have to grow it to the point that eventually, you can have someone else do it for you.
11:51
And that's kind of what you signed up for.
And if you haven't done that up to this point, it might be the reason that you still haven't gotten there, right?
So even sometimes if it takes a short term commitment, from you, saying, Listen sweetheart, I'm going To be like it's me, six months but I'm going to be able to or 3x our growth rate so that can get back out and pay someone to take this availability over that's far right.
12:10
But we're talking we're not just talking like an incremental increase.
We're talking talking 2 x 3 x amount of people walk in the door and have the data to back that now which is crazy to consider.
All right.
So anyways I hope you guys hope.
You guys take that into consideration when you're trying to communicate something to your your tribes, your community talk about in terms of pain avoidance talked about, in terms of the things that they won't have to do.
12:32
That they currently do.
So it's basically taking things that they don't like now and removing them rather than adding things that that they would enjoy, right?
If you talk about it in those terms, people tend to be more responsive to it.
And if you are a donor for God's sake, open up your flexible.









Company0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll over the gym Secrets podcast.
0:18
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
I wanted to bring up something that's very important for marketing.
All right, so Jim wants has been focusing a lot on acquisition.
0:35
We always have.
But especially, I mean 2020.
That's our entire Focus for our community.
Who would I want to do is dispel some of the myths, dispel some of the myths, or I don't stuff that people talk about the really just isn't important for marketing.
0:51
And so I see this stuff all the time.
You do to so-and-so got a thousand leads in two days, right?
Or so.
And so got one.
Our leads.
And so the were a lot of people will direct your attention is the cost per lead, right?
1:07
And it's usually because it's the top part of the funnel and you moved, it would almost be as ridiculous as saying, so, and so it was getting one dollar clicks, right?
Someone says getting five dollar cost per impression, right cost per eyeball and so the further up, you go in the funnel.
1:22
And by following me from, like, click all the way to customer the the further away from the truth, you really get right?
And so, So the only number that really marketing, it's art that really matters in marketing from an acquisition standpoint is cost per acquisition and I would say.
1:38
Secondary number that matters are the two other numbers at.
That would be subsets of that will be upfront, cash value, and then lifetime value.
All right, so those are kind of the three big ones that you're looking at from an act from from for marketing right now.
Here's one of the mistakes that a lot of people make, a lot of a lot of agencies, know that less experienced business owners will say these things or maybe the agencies, don't know this, right?
2:00
So they'll say, hey and I just literally got this example from someone in her community, they were getting solicited by a marketing agency and they're like, hey we got, you know.
So and so's lead pass from $30 lead to 20 dollars, right?
And they were marking that as a, you know, really great outcome, which, you know, is great, whatever, right.
2:20
But the point is that the cost for the marketing Services was two thousand dollars a month and when those marketing Services were taken into account, Count into the cost coreper lead.
Now, I'm still not getting to the major stuff.
I'm just saying at least showing this the cost per lead to cost for leave.
2:36
Went up to $45 late.
And so if anything for the customer that was literally their testimonial, they had actually made their situation worse, right?
And so this is kind of where you start unpacking the data and thinking like does this really matter and why is this important?
2:52
And so I'm going to walk through each step real quick and then I'm going to tie into why the last number matters, which is cost of acquisition, right?
Is that first you have Impressions which is your cost per eyeballs, which depends on whatever media Source, you're using, whether it's Facebook, Instagram, whatever you're getting charged for eyeballs, right from there you have clicks, right?
3:10
That's when people talk about Ctrl, click through it especially unique, click through it because that's what matters.
How many unique people are clicking on the link to get to your page, right?
So be the next piece.
Alright.
So now that you've got eyeballs, you've got a certain percentage of those eyeballs at click uniquely because one person clicking five times is really matter.
3:26
And that's why these data points can be deceptive.
Oh, we're getting Clicks.
It's like, well, what if people are just clicking all the time with you have Bots that are clicking right?
Which is actually super common and then from there you have your opt-ins regular leads, you have conversion rate on the page.
What percentage of people are opting in.
3:42
Thank God.
And here we are.
We have a lead right now from that lead.
You then have a schedule rate of some sort.
If you're doing appointments, which most service-based, businesses, that are listening to, this are doing appointments of some sort, right?
You have your schedule, right and then you have your show, all right?
3:57
And then after your show right?
You Do our actual sale itself.
So how many people of the people who are walking, or actually enclosed?
And then from that close, you have your upfront, rather, how much cash is collected pain?
The first transaction, and then the lifetime value, which is what you're expecting to collect over the life of the customer, right?
4:15
And so as a rule of thumb just so you guys know, you want to have a 321 or higher, LTV a calculation which means a lifetime value of the customer to the cost of acquisition.
Now, that's what most businesses say is.
Like, if you can't be above three, you're not really the business probably won't work.
4:32
I like to be much, you know, much much harder than arjan's whenever you get five and half to 1 only front end, not even including a lifetime value.
Now, the difference is that some businesses are higher higher profit than others.
And so, the actual lifetime value is taken off of gross margin.
4:48
Okay.
And so that means the cost.
So like when we let me give you an easy example.
So with meals, right?
If we're selling a meal I'm just going to use Easy numbers here.
So let's say we saw a hundred dollars with meals and let's say the Cost of those meal hard cost of just food labor etcetera, right?
For those meals, let's say is is is $60, okay, so $60 of that is just hard cost, right?
5:11
And then now we have forty dollars left over which is our gross margin and so if we know someone's going to make four of those hundred dollar purchases, the lifetime value is not $400 but four times the $40 that's left over which is going to be 160 and that's what we do.
5:26
Our ratio of three to one off of and so when you're looking at your Gin.
And you know what, your gross margin is?
Which should be, you know, if you're, if you're spreading out your spreading out, your red between all your classes and your cost per trainer for all the sex, you know, for all the classes, then you're going to get your gross margin for fulfilling the service, right?
5:46
And so, whatever that gross margin has and then from that, that's what you're going to multiply out in order to determine whether it's profitable for you to acquire customers, what makes sense for this marketing campaign, right now, back to the original premise, the only marketing member that matters is Cost of acquisition right now, the reason I had the two other numbers, which is up front for cash and left in values because let me give you a counter example.
6:08
Let's say it cost me $10 right to acquire a customer that is worth.
I don't know.
Let's say, $40 right?
Just for simple math.
Alright, now let's say I get zero of that money and I'm going to get that 40 dollars over the next year.
6:24
I have to have a lot of money up front.
I don't have capital in my pocket.
Maybe outside funding Etc.
See Able to spend 10 dollars to make that sale.
Now, let's counter that with a different promotion.
So right, we're trying to attract a different type of customers.
Say, it's a personal training, that's right.
6:39
And let's say it cost us, I don't know.
Five hundred dollars to acquire this customer, but we immediately get 1000 or 2000, and we know that this person is gonna be worth 10 on average, right?
And so, even though it might cost us more to acquire these customers were actually making more money overall and we have immediate cash value.
6:57
And so, this is where it gets really interesting into like the different shades of marketing.
Why one number might not tell.
All right, so back to the original thing, Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
7:17
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
Would you look at the marketing agencies are we're getting $20?
7:33
C PM, their $10 2pm's.
Probably not.
We're getting one dollar clicks for.
What, for, what, promotion, how do we know they're unique?
Are they are like, what are people clicking on?
Raise a picture of a hot chick?
Or is it a picture of you just explaining your program?
Well, probably the you coming to expand your program to be more qualified.
7:48
Click, there might be fewer of them, but the likely that that click becomes a customer's much higher, right?
And so then, once you have your leads, and then you have a certain percentage that schedule, okay?
Well, how much is my cost per schedule?
All right, this is getting a little bit.
Closer to home is becoming a little more interesting, little bit more value, right?
8:03
And then even further along, what's my cost per show, right?
And so for me, I think, if I'm if I'm thinking, I'm breaking this down for like if I'm talking to a gym, which most of you guys are or we're program or service, whatever, I'm going to be looking for marketing at cost per ship right now.
8:20
Big picture.
You have to know what promotions your marketing, right?
If you're running, you know, a 14-day free trial compared to a 12-week ultimate transformation, you're probably not.
Different cost for showing those, but you might close a higher percentage of the people are coming in for 12 week and you might close but at higher average ticket.
8:38
And so that's where the ratios of how much of costs compared to how much cash up front compared to lifetime, value comes into play, and that's how you can really make analysis of whether or not your marketing is working for your business, right?
And so, when you take all this stuff into consideration, like the only objective I had for this entire piece of content is just think a little bit more.
9:00
On the headline when someone says I'm getting one dollar leads well how many of them are scheduling of the people that are scheduling, how many of them are showing of The Who are showing what percentage of those are buying and what packages, right.
And so then it gives you four more truth in to what's going on and those are the types of questions that you want to ask someone if they're if they're telling you or they're spouting out individual stats, that aren't within the larger context of an entire container, really even an entire business model.
9:26
The reason that I'm become so obsessed with this stuff because I continually try and I'm Obviously improve our business but also the businesses of all the dreams that we work with etcetera, is that as I've driven divin, I think that's the word I've done super deep, dives into the data on the outside of the of the shop, which is all the software that we had that automates lead nurture.
9:45
So that means we get leads to show without any human interaction and it's been an incredibly long and Incredibly incredibly deep learning process for me because there's so many more variables than I initially thought.
And that's because in a Small data set your, you can under, you can see all the variables when you see across the large data sets you have a lot more that come up, right?
10:06
The different markets like people in New York compared to people in the midwest tend to show up less for appointments, right?
Is nothing you can do about it, you should really worry about it, but it's just something that is data.
It's a very right now.
Other other interesting stats in the things that affect this a lot, believe it or not, or actually counterintuitive, or maybe they are intuitive.
10:24
But a lot of times our community, for example, and this is something that I even espouse.
And This is why I'm probably rescinding that.
It's like we started running ads with food right because we're getting shitloads of clicks, right?
And we were pushing them over short, squeeze Pages, short opt-in pages so just like name phone or email, really no description.
10:42
Right?
The thing is, is that short off the pages, tend to outperform longer outside pitch in general, not always.
There's always examples that are different but in general, they tend to outperform now, here's where it gets interesting.
The lead quality as measured by throughput from the point of turning into a lead to turning into show.
11:02
Can sometimes be three to five x hire based on what they saw before they opted in.
And this is the stuff that I'm wondering because like Alan starts at the point of opt.
Once you get the name from rip, that's when Alan starts, working them to get them scheduling, get them to show right.
But I'm seeing these massive differences between to, you know, to Jim's, even in similar markets.
11:24
Even running similar promotions, right?
Two of them are running in a, let's say a 28-day transformation or a month.
Whatever.
Right now, one Jim, let's say is running food, pics, or pick some hot chick, right?
And then they're going to a short squeeze page if that's what's happening.
That, that person might get much cheaper leads, but they might not get more people in the door and that's what you have to be measuring off of when you're looking and then Jim.
11:47
Number 2, might have a picture, you know, might have a picture of people working out or might have a video if you're working out with an explanation at the end you might have.
Decent amount clicks from that.
But then going to a page that has more explanation of the program that benefits is that are outlined in the pain that someone with experience.
12:02
Now, people are more aware and the offer becomes more relevant and some people might think I would argue wrongfully why?
I just wanna get as many loads as I can.
The thing is if you tell someone more about your program and then they choose not to opt in that's a good thing.
12:18
They're segmenting themselves out and saying that like they weren't actually interested and so that way you don't waste your time and effort Hurt on the right.
And so if you have a higher purpose, like the people who are opting in even if you have, let's say half as many that opt-in.
But of those have they are three times more likely to show.
12:36
Now you have a marketing campaign that is working better than kind of what a traditional clickbait looking campaign might be all right?
And so when your mark making your marketing measure what matters measure and look as far as close as possible to the actual sale itself and how much revenue You're able to generate per show because that's going to take into account, your closure it.
12:59
So if all of a sudden people coming in from one, promotion are closing in a much higher percentage than people coming from a different promotion, the next definitely going to affect whether you think that promotions good or not, right?
And so you have to measure it as close to the sales possible because that way, you're going to have a revenue per show and then that way you can back it all the way your campaigns and then you'll be able to see whether these campaigns are actually better or not.
13:20
And if you are getting talked to by or someone's trying to talk to Mark and they Spout off.
Like a we gotta 80% conversion, runner-up to page what's the offer in which the traffic, right?
We're getting, we're getting, you know, whatever.
You know, we're getting $2.
Cool but like what's the offer was the traffic, you know, like what's Give me the give me context, right?
13:39
And so that is all I would implore you to do.
So, if you're thinking about marketing, make sure you're measuring ask close to the sales from the possible.
Taking a look at the three big metrics.
One is cost of acquisition of just always going to be king.
Then the two sub metrics, which is going to be immediate cash value and lifetime value of the customer, which you want.
Want that to be at least three to one for your gross margin.
13:57
Not from your total revenue collected.
Big key point.
Want that to be at least three to one for your gross margin.
Not from your total revenue collected.
Big key point.









Company0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
The number one reason that people I fail is because they are successful, then they change something.
Welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
0:45
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Talk to you about something today.
That is probably the biggest mistake that I've ever made, and that I've repeatedly made and hopefully kind of a heat of warning and kind of an explanation of how to avoid that same mistake.
And honestly, it's probably the number one biggest mistake that successful entrepreneurs make and I say successful with a grain of salt, you know, I mean because success is defined however you want it.
1:08
But basically once you've accomplished something that you set out to accomplish, I would say like in doesn't matter what level, it could be making your first sale.
That this is the number one issue that people Mick.
And so this is where the whole concept of self-sabotage comes from not being able to sustain levels of success, right?
1:25
Like you can get there but you can't stay there and it comes from this one kind of central concept and it's honestly one of the single hardest things to master as an entrepreneur and it's still something that I work on every day and this is kind of what it is.
It's not being able to repeat successful actions and what I mean by that is every time you You do something and you actually works right?
1:50
You try a bunch of things.
Then finally, it works.
What you then think is, oh, I should continue to try more things but the reality is that you already bore the cost of learning how to do that thing to get there.
And what you need to do at that point is just continue to do that successful action over and over and over and over again.
2:06
The problem is the personality traits that you and I have that got us.
There are not the things that keep us there.
And so we have to go against our own nature in order to sustain success.
And so, and the thing is is that it's incredibly boring.
It's really difficult because you have to learn different, you have to emphasize different aspects of your character and you have to learn different skill sets.
2:25
And so for me, part of that skill set that you have to learn is kind of being able to focus at each level and I'm defining Focus as the ability to say no right and the ability to not change things because it's in our nature, to always want to tweak.
I always want to Tinker.
But the number one reason that people fail is because they are successful, then they change something and then they're normal and it no longer.
2:48
Anger works, right?
And they're like, yeah, I change this and then all of a sudden my numbers, you know Crush.
But the thing is is they change multiple things the same time and then they don't know which one is the one that is the problem.
Now, in theory, you're like, oh, I only change one thing at a time.
No, you don't don't lie to yourself, you change, multiple things.
And so in order to focus at each level, the thing is that the the level of opportunity continues to go up as you oopsies, the level of opportunity continues to rise.
3:18
As you go up.
So it's like in the beginning, you have to say, no to let's say you know a 50,000 dollar opportunity and then once you level up then it's like you're saying no to a, you know, 250 thousand dollar opportunity, and then you're saying, no to a million-dollar opportunity and then you're saying no to a ten million dollar opportunity.
3:37
And the thing is, is that every single time it looks beautiful and because it's always, because as you level up and your skill set levels up the attractiveness of Of this new opportunity will raise with you, so it's like the the temptress becomes more and more beautiful to you as your skill set increases.
3:56
And so don't think that you're like, well I learned how to say no at this level, right?
I say no.
I like you don't even have to try and say no to that stuff anymore because I don't even think about it, right.
But when one of these comes along right or or one of these comes along it's really hard.
4:11
It's really, really hard to stay the path and be able to stay focused and continue to do this stuff and The successful actions and do them over and over again.
And so the reason that business owners, entrepreneurs Etc are not successful when they don't repeat successful.
4:28
Actions is something called the bergman's Trap and so dr.
Bergman was a PhD at at Stanford MBA, for business school.
And and essentially, with the burgling Trap is is it's better to know why you failed and be correct and knowing exactly why you did not succeed.
4:48
Versus being successful and not knowing why you won?
And the reality is that I think the vast majority of us, myself included, we think we're smarter than we are.
And we don't actually know why we succeed it.
And so that's why it gets really, really tricky.
5:06
When you go back to hear where you're like, well, this thing worked, I'm smart I know exactly what made it work.
So I know how I can improve it.
When in reality you have no clue why it worked because you try 20 other.
Things and they didn't work.
And you thought all of them were going to work.
Think about that for a second.
5:21
You try 20 other things that you thought were going to work and none of them worked.
So I would say that your predictive ability is probably pretty poor.
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
5:37
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I guess a partner with you.
5:54
So that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
Right.
And the reality is that rational design really doesn't work?
Trevor could talk about this forever, but a lot of times, it's people stumble into things.
They try they try, they try and then finally something works.
6:10
And so, if you think about that from a rational like concept, you actually have no clue why it worked.
So why would you think that you would have the ability to start tweaking and tinkering with it, right?
And so you have to fight that aspect of your nature that likes to tweak and likes to Tinker because it is that what got you.
There is not going to continue to allow you to see the success.
6:28
And what's interesting is that if you Look at growth, if you look at growth overall.
The fun part is here in the beginning, right?
This is where entrepreneurs are having fun, right?
6:45
But here is where entrepreneurs are sad, but here is where you make profit.
And here is where you make happiness, is where you're basically breaking even.
7:02
Right.
And the reason that is so interesting, is that in the beginning, you're breaking even because you're continuing to reinvest in the growth where you have to have more people come in.
You have to hire more staff so you can fulfill more people, you spend more on ad spend all those things and it's exciting because new things are happening and we love new shit, right?
7:19
But the problem is that where you actually make your profit is where you actually continue.
To repeat the same actions over and over again and don't mess with it.
And this is where entrepreneurs get bored.
And this is where I see, you know, in our community people just lose focus.
7:34
They just can't stay focused.
They have a successful gym and they self Sabotage by just trying something else that's new because they're bored of making the money that they are dead serious.
They get bored of making the money they do.
And they actually just introduced chaos into their own business because they want to do this again.
7:51
But the reality is that once you fix the business, once you fix the operating model of a You provided more value to the end user.
This is where you make a profit.
This is where you have to learn to make a profit.
Some of the most bored times.
I've had it, Jim launch.
Like me personally, it's been like, we don't do anything new and we just make a ton of profit, right?
8:10
All of this profit between, you know, our cost etcetera because we're not spending all this money, reinvesting, in trying to tweak things right now, obviously we innovate a shitload but that's a defined process in and of itself because that's a successful action that we continue to repeat.
We have our whole Has we test two, three, four things and some of the work and then every once in awhile we Crush one out the park like the diagnostic selling process.
8:31
But the point is that you have to and it's like well then how do you innovate you have to innovate and small controlled settings.
So if you're looking at your attention span for like how you innovate, you know what, I'll just stay here.
If you're looking at your attention span for how you innovate it's got to be like 90/10, right?
8:48
Like 10% of your time.
And the thing is is that you're like yeah I'm only doing ten percent of my time now.
No, you're not.
You're not doing 10% your time.
All right.
You're doing Like, 40%, your time is on your new project, and 60% is on your existing business, or maybe it's even flip-flopped.
All right?
10 percent means you're putting like, you know, two to three hours a week into this thing that you are finding interesting.
9:07
You know, that's it.
That's all you're doing.
And the rest of your time is doing what I would consider Q&A, which is quality assurance, which is making sure that the things that are supposed to happen are successfully happening, continually, right are the same people.
Calling the leads are the same people following the script of they walk in the door is every client being reached out to for their 101.
9:26
How is the 14-day nutrition going?
What percentage of people are getting up, sold in the supplements and food Etc, right?
And you have to just make sure that those things are happening and so that's the boring part that's the part.
No one wants to do.
That's the part that no one likes, but that's where all the profit is.
9:43
All the profit is being able to consistently do the same action over and over again and it's boring as hell.
And that's why most people cannot sustain success is because they fail fail fail achieve And then fail fail fail, because they continue to change, because they what got them there of continuing to tweak, and Tinker.
10:01
They continue to tweak and tinker.
And then they take it again because they'd actually don't know why they achieve the success that they did.
All right?
So, my advice that I'm also half telling myself, is just keep doing the boring work, keep doing the stuff that got you there and be okay, not optimizing in your own minds.
10:19
Because in reality when you try and optimize you end up taking it.
So just be okay with Making money and consistently doing that over and over and over again because that's the point.
All right.
So anyways, have an amazing day.
Hope you guys found that valuable.
I hope that that convince somebody who's about to try and do something new in their business to not do that, and just keep doing the boring work.
10:40
Continuing to reach out to new prospects, continuing to nurture leads, continue to sell.
Using the right process, continue to service them so that you can get them great results and make it happen.

I see.
So many gym owners, make the exact same mistake again and again and it's forgetting how to position stuff to sell.
Welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
0:36
I hope you enjoy and subscribe drilling excited for going into 2020.
So obviously in the gym industry 2020, January New Year's Eve, New Year's resolutions.
As a time that there's a lot of talk.
Now, big picture typically the biggest ones for service based facilities is actually like February and March and I think it's just Kind of The Compound Effect of Post.
0:59
New Year's resolution for Big Box gyms where they actually sell memberships, January, tends to be the biggest month, because usually happens to someone goes there, they fail within three or four weeks, they realize they need more help, and that's when you know, p t cells, Etc, pick up, February and March.
Now, that being set does not mean you should not absolutely dominate January.
1:17
So we're going to go through is the number one mistake that I'm seeing just make right now and it's kind of, I don't know, say it's cute because it's not cute.
But like, I see so many gym owners make the exact same mistake again and again and it's forgetting how to position stuff to sell.
1:35
And so what I do is kind of give you a little bit of a countdown of how to create hype that's going to allow you to sell more people into your gym or people in your programs Etc.
Just kind of use the framework for how I've done it, right?
And so the framework that I have is the same framework that I used last year and right after we did this kind of launch hype framework for Christie's Labs, The Southern Company.
1:58
We did 2.4 million in five weeks, right?
And so, and everyone that I was, who's doing that with us all the time what you're doing or modeling the exact same process.
All right.
So the big mistake that I see everyone make is they just post and they're like by my shit.
2:14
Hey sign up for my shit.
Hey Center, for my shit.
And it's really ad hoc.
It's not deliberate and there's no questions or information or belief that are being addressed.
It's just like, Hey, by my shit.
Lake.
Hey, buy my shit like brain doesn't work, so the process you have to go through.
2:32
I heard this recently, I don't know who it's from, but whisper T, is shout.
And actually just really like the way that that sounded in terms of how to promote stuff, right?
And so like, we just launched meals, right?
And so if you were, if you were trying to launch a new program, 42 Day, Shred New Year, New You, whatever, right?
2:53
You're going to start a little further out and you're not going to be marketing nearly as much.
It It's just enough, it's a whisper, right?
And so for me, I think the best place to do that is in your warmer audience, so that's like your free group or your gym, you know, your clients group Etc.
You can just make a post the big countdown timer and like the logo of the challenge, right?
3:10
Doesn't have to be more than that and mind.
You might not even have the thing ready yet.
You don't need to, you should have the freaking graphic, right?
It's, you just post that you even need to put any any copy around it and just be like it is coming and then everyone will get super excited about it, right a week later, you can do the same thing, you know, with less He's on the countdown again, right?
3:28
We're talking like a month out.
Now, the heavy marketing for me, when I start any more than a month out, starting to heavily Market it, I think it kind of backfires.
I feel like it, crescendos, too early so I feel like, I feel like 10 to 14 days is where like you Crescendo into like, Max hype and so putting like the post out a month out and then nothing else.
3:50
Maybe one email one post a week later, one email one post and then now you're into the Last kind of 14 day cycle.
And at that point, then you can really start marketing.
I usually do it in a 10-day countdown because maybe I don't like writing is my emails or I just feel like people are people have.
4:08
So short of attention spans that like I don't think you need to keep something top of mind for a very long time.
I think it's just like keep it top of mind for 10 days and then launch of thing, right?
So what is the process in that?
Kind of 10-day window.
So there's kind of the five, five, or six emails that go out.
4:24
I like every other day works fine for me.
And I probably do it that way.
Because again, I don't like writing tons of emails, but if you're ready, if you're studying 10 days out your like email one, you know, day off, email to day off email three.
That tends to work very well and what you're trying to do is trying to adjust and head.
4:41
It's like ahead of time, what concerns someone might have, right?
The things that they would get excited about what is in it for them, right?
And typically you should be making a program that's trying to address certain pains that everyone experiences, right?
So it's like don't like if you're including meal prep, for example, it it's Like don't have time to cook, don't have time to count your Macros.
4:59
Don't have time to go to.
Like so then you can just basically exaggerated or aggravate, the pain associated with just buying your own food with just, you know, whatever.
Right.
And if you were selling something, that was just like, like, sure we launched our meal program.
That's how I was just talking with that.
But like, if you were launching because your training stuff, right?
5:18
Your services.
So instead it's like aggravating the pain around going to the gym figuring out what to do, walk around aimlessly, having people judge you.
Are you wondering what you're going to be doing next?
And then all the while, giving up things going on the treadmill where you get bored within 10 minutes and then leave ashamed of yourself, right?
5:35
So like that's where we're talking about like, okay, we're going to talk in terms of the customer and about things that they're struggling with.
Now if your program addresses, multiple of those facets, then have each email address, like the nutrition component of trying to figure out milk, right.
5:50
And then the fitness part about going along with Jim not knowing is doing.
And then, like the accountability part of like, Like not wanting to not being motivated, not having somebody that like help you out, be more like all of that kind of stuff, right?
So you hit into those emails and you basically can just recycle them through again and you know leaning on one aspect because reality is that not everyone's going to read all your emails and sometimes it's better to be reminded than taught, right?
6:13
And it's okay to recycle the same thing kind of Hit the same points again.
Just say two different ways.
All right, so it's kind of like, if you had three points, you could have like an intro email and then point one, two, three.
And then point, one and two and point, two and three and then kind of Beginning of the crescendo because at that point if you had six emails and you have like day ten eight, six, four, two.
6:33
And now you have 1 & 0 0 being launched at, right?
So they one is going to be like hey 24 hours left.
You don't even need to put any copy in here just like hey get ready to watch me.
Sick, super excited.
Get ready to sign up right now, on launch day.
Alright, really important?
6:48
I, if anybody saw for the meals, I emailed like six times on that day, right?
And I've got that from Frank Kern.
I got that from Russell.
I got that from every big internet marketer that I know is that on launch day?
The email like six times they're like the reason we do that is because we want it to be on the top of their inbox and they see it like, it's just like you even have to have copying it.
7:05
You be like 4 hours left dot dot dot and that you like your body copy can be like, see subjects rather like it's like, you just want them to see the inbox right now.
If you have phone numbers for all these people, you can also do this concurrently with text messages right now, if you're like, I don't want to sell via webinar, which you probably should it.
7:26
And by I mean, definitely don't fucking do that if you're in person business.
All right.
So please God like Alex doesn't have us.
Do what he does because he's trying to hold something back from us.
Know, if I had fucking in-person business, I would sell in person.
Duh, I would use the biggest Advantage ever of having trust face-to-face.
7:42
Anyways, sorry little side note anyways.
So you're doing your countdown right now.
You have your text going on.
Top of that.
Now, the text need to be super short and you're basically trying to distill down like then entire email until like one bullet right now, the last like 48 hours or trying to push is going to be the link for them to like sign up for the thing right now.
8:08
You don't need to buy the thing like if you're if you're like these you think you should have them opt-in and then schedule a time or just have them straight schedule a time if it's if it's a warm list, if it's like you were your Client List It said are you can have them as straight schedule a time side with you because they're probably not going to know show you right?
And so at that point you can have everyone sign up for the thing.
8:27
So that you can have one on to consultations every 30 minutes house.
Like men Alex, it sounds like a lot of work.
I'm telling you, every single time like don't be cute, don't get fancy.
This is the best way to launch your facility.
Have a huge momentous starting and if you want to also include the referral part like which you definitely should write, like, tell them to bring a friend with them to the orientation you can you can close the friend and get them signed up because like if they're coming with someone, they're not going to not buy unless you're an absolute idiot.
8:57
Right?
So like have them bring people with them.
They can schedule for themselves and just bring their friend with him.
It just makes it logistically.
Very easy.
All right, so Hey, if you're a return listener and you have not rated or reviewed the show, I want you to know that you should feel absolutely terrible about yourself and everything else in the world.
9:16
I'm kidding.
But it would mean the absolute world to me.
If you guys would go ahead and do that, you don't have to pause the show, you keep listening and you can just do it with your thumb right now will take you less than 60 seconds.
And like I said, the only way that podcast arose through word of mouth and this is you joining hands with me and helping as many isomers with possibly can because no one is coming to save us, it's just us.
9:33
All right, so please go do that now then let's get back to the show.
Big recap, here's what to do and what not to do.
All right?
So if you're trying to promote something new, don't you feel like, hey, here's our new thing, click the link, sign up.
Hey, here's a new thing.
9:49
Click like new like having sequence Whispering tease, it build excitement, right?
Then in the 10 days, leading up to like your registration opening or when you open up your calendar.
At that point is where you go every other day, email address their beliefs and then tax.
10:08
But if you are allowed to the same thing kind of on the off day.
So if you email on day 10, texts on day nine, emailing the eight text on day 7 and that way you have this nice Cadence inside of Facebook groups, what I've seen in terms of posting Cadence.
I really stick to the once a week because like, it takes, like, two days for a postal.
10:26
Like I feel like it's seen by everyone, and if I post like more than once a week, it just feels like aggressive.
And people are still, like, in the old posts.
I just, I've just done once a week and then with the exception of the last week, I'll do a, I'll do a 24-hour, reminder on Thursday, if I'm doing like a launched on Friday or something like that.
10:45
So that way it's like they'll get four weeks out, three weeks out, two weeks out, one week out, and then 24-hour reminder in the post.
So, if you're keeping track at home here, there's basically three channels on communicating on.
All right, I've got my text, I've got my emails that I've got my Facebook posts.
11:01
All right, and the Facebook post.
The first two are really just Whispers.
I don't really say anything.
And then the last Two before the 24 hour countdown is me kind of doing a high level overview of how cool the program is and all that kind of stuff, right?
And so that is how you want to promote stuff.
11:18
All right, now I think the reason that people get hung up on this is especially if they're excited about something.
It seems like something that they want to do.
They're like I can't believe anyone would want to do this thing, right?
It's like I'm seeing it right now with meals right?
Which is funny because like, everyone should be excited about because but thing is just like the rules of selling don't change, right?
11:36
It's, I had a I'm owner who came up to us at want to come up to me at one of my, one of our Mastermind recently.
He's like, hey, man, I just bought this twenty thousand dollar piece of equipment.
It's this EMS bodysuit thing and he's like, so how do I sell it?
And I was like the exact same way.
You saw everything else clarify.
11:52
Why?
They're like, we don't know.
But like how do I sell this thing?
I was like, you don't because no one cares.
There's literally, like, are they trying to lose weight?
Yes, cool.
So they're going to exercising to work out the fact that using this thing makes no difference, whether it's cycle, you know, or spin or it's, Kickboxing or, you know, you know whatever, we lifting CrossFit, whatever.
12:11
It doesn't matter.
Just doesn't matter, right?
And so anyways, he was like really sure he's like, but how do I sell a?
He literally kept coming back from like, six times and I was like, dude, like it doesn't fucking matter.
And so finally, I was like, listen, the only thing that this can do.
I was like the big selling point is that it only takes two to sessions for 20 minutes twice a week, right?
12:30
He was like, yeah, I was like then the only thing you're going to set like that you can have in addition to this as a benefit is that it takes us time as like That's it.
It's not like that's also just takes less commitment on their side which you can increase the value of what you're selling because they need to do less.
They need to be here for fewer hours of the week.
12:47
That's all right, but he thought he had to have like, a whole different pitch just like nah, man.
Like it's the same game, right?
So don't make that mistake.
When you were trying to Market your new programs, don't think.
Because this thing is so awesome, I think it's so awesome.
People are just going to consign up because it's so awesome.
13:04
Unfortunately, people don't think that way, right?
And you Still have to do and said this point.
I feel like it's the dance of sales because it's like honestly like I wish I didn't have to make big pitch decks, you know what I mean?
That take me like three days to make but I understand that like as humans we like being sold.
13:20
We want to be sold people like buying stuff.
Think about it.
Do you like buying stuff for yourself?
Like, do you enjoy going and buying stuff for yourself?
Yes.
And so what we have to do is just allow people to do that and just take them through the dance that they want us to take.
13:36
They want us to take them.
I'm through.
All right, so build anticipation, whisper it first then, tease it then shout it, which is going to be the last, you know, three days where you're just pumping it and making sure that everyone sees it.
And here's the reality, I said a bunch of boxes of foods people that I, that I better just friends of mine have been fought, you know, forever.
13:56
And one person I text I was like, hey man, I was like how do you like that food?
And he was like, oh shit.
That was you?
And I was like, where the fuck?
If you bid I was like, how did you Like what?
And so then I just realized it was just like a nice reminder to myself is that like you can Market your face off and still there will be people who don't see Jack shit, right?
14:17
And so any Hill, I hope you guys have an amazing Friday.
Make sure.
Now one final warning with this is that if right now you're like oh I've got this thing that's going to start in 3 days.
If you have done this wrong right I honestly would recommend you take 10 days from now and just make that a little bit of your hype and then follow that process.
14:36
At least.
The last 10 days.
All right, if you don't, you're going to be really underwhelmed with how poorly it's going to do and you're going to be really disappointed.
Like, oh my God, I wasted January right?
So don't do that.
Now, in terms of, I saw some questions in my own groups.
I was about to say, I'm now, if it's like, what should I do?
14:53
Externally versus internally, you can do both the same thing or you can do them different.
It's up to you, it doesn't really matter, right?
Like, as look like, if you do a 42 Day Shred, it's going to work.
Externally and internally.
If you're doing a six-week, do you know New Year New, You doesn't it?
It's Work externally and internally.
15:08
The other day, the people who are your clients are going to trust you, no matter what, and they're going to want to do whatever the thing is like they're like, like, hey Rosie, do you want to come like, do this whole 30 with me?
And I'll be like, no.
I'm like, I'm at Alex's Jim.
I'm sure he's gonna have something.
I'll just do whatever they're doing, right?
Like you have trust with your clients, like just do the dance that they want you to do.
15:28
Make them feel excited about buying the thing that you're going to have them by so that they get more but into it and ultimately get better results.
So anyways I hope you have an amazing Friday.
Day.
I hope you follow these things and don't make the mistakes that I just said, like, you have to promote, you have to do it the right way.
15:43
And if you don't do it that way, then you will be really sad and less people will lose weight and you'll be, you know, sad face the injera, but you don't to be all right, because especially because easily avoidable.
All right, so tag people like this, anybody who has to help you with this stuff.

What's going on, everybody?
I'm bringing some more books, but I wanted to say that, if you haven't checked out Hunter million-dollar offers, I would definitely suggest that you start there.
I've gotten some solid feedback and it couldn't be happier with its.

0:15
It's 164 pages.
I really can help you out.
It takes about four hours to get through, check it out.
On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
The audiobook is Lowe's, they'll let me put it on for it, so I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast, but I've had this happen.
Before it's like, I like I don't have my wallet with me and I can't tell you about of times people, like all right, I'm gonna get it.
0:35
Welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Good morning.
Every one of you guys are having a great start to your week.
0:51
I wanted to give you something super tactical today.
This probably only a couple minutes but I just got off the phone training sales team.
For in-person sales and they were closing trials.
And so they're like what if someone, you know, says that they didn't bring their wallet or they left their card at home?
1:09
How do I how to overcome them?
And so the big one is virtually, no human actually leaves their Cardinal.
So that's the first thing is you have to say like, no one actually leaves their home with other like it, they don't and not like, 10% or 20%.
Like, how many times have you left your house without your wallet, like one in?
1:25
I mean, like twice a year, you know, it really doesn't make sense, right?
So you have To have that conviction first that that's not true at all, right?
And so there's some easy things that you can do to overcome that.
The first one is whatever you are.
Transitioning to the clothes, right?
1:41
Rely case you want to do it, they're like awesome.
That's where you can just say great.
So it's need your ID right?
Your gesture handle like I need your ID and so at that point you're not asking for their credit card and so most people take out their wallet or their take their purse out in the, put it on the bench and then they'll usually take the rod out of the purse.
1:58
If it's a girl, it's a I'll take his wallet out right when that happens, they can't say they forgot their wallet but you asked for something that wasn't their credit card.
And so you do this for a couple reasons, one, you should ask for their ID so that you can make sure that the info is correct, right?
And you can also have some bench.
Oh, you're from, you know, you're from Pomona.
No way, you know me, tell you live around there bottle of all, right?
2:15
And so as you're making small talk and then after that, it's like awesome.
Just you know, whatever card you use.
And so you take the card and you hand it back to them.
And you can gesture towards their wallets awesome.
And it's kind of like, you're like, I'll trade you, right?
It's when you do that, it makes it seem super low-key.
You should be keeping the conversation.
Ation going during this happening.
2:31
And if you're really low key, now at this point, if you're doing like a trial, for example, this is where someone's like, they might say like, Oh, I thought it was free but like why do I need to put my car down?
And that's where I'm telling you and I've said this before, but I'll say it again because you need to be reminded more than we need to be taught.
You just say it's how we've always done it and you just super low-key about it.
2:49
I got this is always.
Have you done it?
Great.
And just keep going, like, get the card when you use, or which card you want to use, doesn't matter, right?
And just like that, you can Jester back to them.
So asked ID first that's what gets them to take the roll it out, that way they can say they forgot their wallet and then right there you can gesture towards it because that would be ridiculous for them to say that they don't have the wallet.
3:07
Now if they say I don't have the card that I want to use is like no worries won't you put a different card down and then between now and you know the next time you come in on Monday or whatever you can swap out the car fair enough that way.
You can start at least we can get you going.
Okay, so it's just little easy things that you can do to help overcome the whole, like I forgot my wallet, you know, whatever the other thing that sometimes happens.
3:29
Oh, Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
3:45
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
I've had this happen before.
4:01
It's like, I don't have my wallet with me right now, that's if I ask for the ID.
All right, now, if that happens, then I'm like, where's your wallet?
They're like, and I can't tell you about of time.
Someone's like, I left it in the car.
I'll be like, girl and go get it.
I was like your workout starts.
4:16
Now, right now I have found it to be kind of sketchy.
I've done it before where I actually walk out with them, but, you know, it's you gotta feel it.
If you have a good rapport, You like this is where you'd be like, man.
4:31
I work out with you.
Let's go do it together.
I've been sitting all day anyways.
Let's go get it, right?
And so that way you can, you can do that if you have the report, but the worst case is, just like go get it right on my workout starts now.
And you can make a little bit of a joke and I can't tell you the amount of times people, like, all right, I'll go and get it right?
4:50
And, or some people are like, I left my wallet in my car on purpose.
So I wouldn't sign up for something or whatever bullshit, right?
And so, just a couple little tricks that you can use to overcome the My wallet at home etcetera that you can use with your sales team today.
So, easy things after they had, you first get them to take their wallet out.
5:08
Then swap you leaked their ID for the well, up gesture towards the wallet.
Get their info down first always shrug and say, just how we've always done it and you'd be amazing Me growing up.
That's how they've always done it.
And that way, it also makes it seem like it's not in your control.
You're like, just you don't miss a policy because it'd be stupid.
I just be like, just how we've always done it.
5:25
And it means it shows presidents and social proof that other people have done the same thing.

So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
What's up?
Everyone.
0:30
This is Alex and we just had an amazing weekend.
All my gym Woods came into town and we had to spend 12 straight hours.
To days actually gets its 10 hours, both days, 20 hours, whatever.
There's a lot of hours, basically going deep diving deep into the fitness gym business and I want to give you some of the sweet, sweet takeaways.
0:54
So the first thing is at one point, we did a little stand-up thing where I had everyone.
Hold up.
How much extra money.
It made in the last four months working with our system and you wouldn't believe some of the numbers but the highest one was two hundred and thirty four thousand dollars in additional Revenue.
1:10
Second highest was 220,000 it another.
Another couple that was over 200,000.
This is an additional Revenue that they had made in the last four months since they started using our system.
So this is really exciting, really cool for us and got to meet everyone in person who he had met.
1:26
And I think it's also cool for the gym or to connect another They have a community of other a players are generous programs that are hires program where we're all the guys who absolutely Crush their watches and understand the need for more levels of service.
1:44
And basically want to learn the rest of the secrets of how to run their gym, all the stuff that's underneath of the iceberg.
Not the tip, but everything, that's underneath that makes the machine run, then they join that.
But anyways, it was a really awesome weekend and there's a million take away.
So I'll I'll probably be sharing a lot of those in the next few days.
2:03
But the theme of the weekend that I told them, no, want to kind of relay that to you, is that Retention is everything retention is the game.
I can tell you that I talked to hundreds of gym owners.
On a monthly basis and there are only two types of Jim models that make money, the gym owners who have semi-private Studios, who obsess about retention, and making sure they keep every single person.
2:32
And the second model is the Large Group, Training model, where you have, you know, usually in the neighborhood of 100 to $200 a month in recurring, Revenue per person.
And people who obsess about, Our attention for that.
2:49
So there's really just one business model that was kind of what I did there and it's people who obsess about retention in.
The reality, is this is that if you have three ways of building a business, you can acquire more customers, you can get customers to buy more times from you, or you can increase the transaction size, right.
3:08
And within the gym model, the way that that works is you have your face of marketing and referrals, right?
Or is your G working too?
So all three of those as the ways that you acquire Commercial and then you have all of the internal plays warm traffic place to ascend customers up, get them to spend more money with you.
3:27
Give them samples at a discount of the higher levels of service internally so that they desire higher levels of service because actually know what it's like.
And then, how do you give them amazing service so that they will stay and not leave right?
3:43
Which is getting them to buy more times, right?
Getting them to buy more months of service with you.
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
4:02
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
And just for everyone is here.
4:18
Just as a side, note is the popped in my head contract.
I don't think mean a ton.
I mean we definitely have people use to come up and talk much contracts but the only reason some will stay is if you're continually delivering value, it's easy to sell people.
4:34
It's hard to keep people, okay?
Unless you're really paying attention this.
So the first thing here and this is the biggest.
The first thing that I want everyone who's listening to this to do is go now and calculate what your retention rate is.
I had some of the Doom Lord, raise their hands.
I said, who here knows what their protection numbers are.
4:51
No one raised their hands.
Brad.
This is our first Meetup guarantee.
On our next Meetup.
They all know their numbers, but you have to know what you're choosing numbers are.
If you don't know what it is, I guarantee you.
That's your problem, like, right off the bat.
It's because you don't even think about keeping your customers, and I know some people will listen to this and be like, well, we've had people for three years.
5:09
Duh, every gym businesses had that, but that is not because of you a lot of time.
That's because of things that have happened.
Outside of you.
Like there's a there's a there's a lunch place nearby me that I go to all the time, it's not really because they're that good, it's just reasons really convenient for me, right?
5:27
And so a lot of times we think, That we're doing something really special, because we have a few people are quote core that have been there forever, but if you can't grow past 100 Years of T's, it's because it's because you don't think about growing, right?
5:44
All you're thinking about is the cold Market acquisition.
But, and I'll quote Dan Kennedy on this.
If you if you spent all the money and took all the effort and all the time to acquire customer by God, don't lose them, right?
And so we try and think about this all the time within our business like how How do you think it is too far a gym owner versus acquire?
6:03
Someone who wants to lose weight?
Everyone needs to lose weight.
How many gym owners are there?
Not as many, right?
And so, by God, I can't lose them once I've gotten them and so like what can we do to get people to stay?
A lot of people try and blame their customers and be like, oh no.
Like, you know, people are there wishy-washy.
6:19
But if you can really really over deliver to your customers in such a way from an experiential standpoint, it has nothing to do with results.
Okay, hear me say it again.
Has nothing to do.
With results, you get them in with results, which means you do need to produce results and especially need to Market with results, but it's the experience that keeps them.
6:40
All right, now, in my business, most people that I talk don't have the money to pay me.
So I literally have to go and make the money to pay me but it was your cases that's not the situation, okay?
So within the weight loss industry, you bring them in with results because that's what they think they want.
6:55
But what they really want is they want the rest of their human needs satisfied connection.
Against growth contribution.
All right, variety and routine at the same time.
You have to satisfy those needs.
And that is what's going to keep someone?
7:11
Okay?
So the biggest takeaway that I want to relay to you is one, make sure that you're measuring your numbers when it comes to retention.
If you're not measuring your numbers, I guarantee you're losing tons of people.
Okay, once you do start measuring your numbers, then you can actively start implementing things to try and keep people.
7:29
And you can also see what month people are on when they're leaving track that as well.
Because if you start seeing Seeing that there are blips, right?
Let's see it month.
Three months.
Six months, twelve.
That's when people leave, right?
Then you can start over, delivering, in the month prior and getting them through the quote hump of attrition, that people sometimes experience.
7:53
So first thing track, the numbers second thing track, the people who are leaving what month service or how long they've been with you.
So you know what happens?
And it's not just when people cancel obviously, when people card stops.
You're a decline happens in the don't, you don't recover it.
8:10
Okay.
So it's important to track that because that's where actually usually were more than half of the declines.
Come from our sorry, more than half of the quote cancels come from, is from people who decline in that.
Don't give you a new new payment information, okay?
So use those two things start thinking about retention, it'll be a common thing that I'll bring up a couple more times in the future because it is the game if you can think about conceivably, if you could We lose a customer, you would always grow and your business would be thriving.
8:41
And so it's the fact that you continue to have holes in your bucket, which is the reason that you came across and cutting attrition percentage, believe it or not is significantly easier than attracting new customers.
It's just that most people are in such a scarcity mind, they don't want to focus on retaining customers.
They're only thinking about, when can I get my next hit of new people?
8:59
But as soon as they have them in the door, they don't even pay attention to them.
And look for the next group, right?
And if you can retain customers, It means that you will be able to Aspen everyone else and then you're cold, traffic marketing.
Ironically will be the easiest thing in the world.
All right, so have an amazing day, guys.
9:16
Hope hope that was useful for you and kind of.
Refocus, you on what's truly important within the business.

0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.

And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
I don't know what it is about this.
This but like the word and the concept of deserving something bothers me to my core.
Welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
0:46
I hope you enjoy and subscribe, are you good morning, everyone.
Hope you guys are having a great Friday.
I was in a little bit of a pensive mood this morning because I was packing my bags for a vacation.
Which is the first vacation that I will have gone on, hopefully successfully in my in my professional capacity since I was 20.
1:13
I'm basically since I graduated college and what's weird about this is like I try to go on vacation, I think three other times in my in my career and each time I went back home to work for the next like with In 48 hours, so I cut them short.
1:32
So this time I'm hoping I make it through and it's interesting because I was talking to our neighbor yesterday.
He's an entrepreneur and he sold his business and I was like, yeah, we're going on vacation tomorrow and he's like good for you man.
He's like you deserve it.
Like you work your ass off and I don't know what it is about this but like the word and the concept of deserving something bothers me to my core like it's something that I like, hey, I just, I don't think anyone deserves anything, and I'm not saying that in terms of like the grind hustle thing, like not that side, but like, I think that, like, I have done enough bad things in my life, I have wronged people.
2:16
I have, I have, I mean, I've just done like, as a human, you know what I mean?
Like, I've just, I've done things that I'm not proud of it were the my life, and I don't think I deserve anything.
And I really mean, I mean like I don't think I deserve anything and and I don't really think anyone deserves anything.
2:35
So I think we're all flawed and and what's weird about that is like I think like you're born in America it's like you already want like we deserve nothing more, you know?
I mean like you're not born in sub-Saharan Africa you know with like a 1 out of 6 chance of living or whatever it is right and so it's like it's really weird Sensation from your thought process that like I have to like I'm like cool.
3:00
Part of like deserving stuff and I don't know because what's weird is like I like it feels counter to my identity, right?
Because like I'm I've always been the guy who when I was in the gym and really literally everything up to this point and still was like, every time I saw someone else on vacation I was like, fuck you.
3:20
I was like, I'm getting a head.
I was like every time you relate, like you relax and you sleep and you enjoy your life.
I was like, I'm getting one step closer while you do whatever you're doing.
Right.
And like that.
I almost feel like I got more joy out of that than anything that vacation could give it, you know, and while everyone else was on vacation, everything was even quieter for me.
3:39
So I got laser focused, you know?
I mean I could do more like I was advancing it like double speed you know, doing double time.
Well everyone knows who else was on vacation.
And so it's this weird thing where I'm like, I don't want anyone to feel like they can gain on me while like while I'm taking this five days, you know what I mean.
4:00
And, you know, we're supposed to take off and not, you know, bring any work with us.
I'm still going to end up, not will not working, but I'm going to bring a bunch of books that I want to want to read while I'm there.
And hopefully, I can at least Advanced my skills during during the vacation.
4:20
But I don't know if I can answer for this.
This was just more like a just a weird thought process this morning that I found myself and I was all like packing you know soon.
No gear.
You know?
It's like because we're going to like a ski resort and I was like packing my things like what like what life is this?
4:37
Like you know I mean like this is crazy like I'm going on vacation like what's going on?
And so I think, you know, as a total little pivot during this conversation thought process is that like I don't think anyone deserves anything.
4:53
I think the thought of deserving, something is literally the most entitled bullshit, like, I've ever heard of in my entire life.
Like, you're like, I deserve.
It's like, It's like someone says, like I deserve like you deserve jack shit, you know, you just have nothing ever like ah like anyone like it, especially if it's because you're of like, an identity thing of like, I deserve this because I'm a woman.
5:14
Ah, like I deserve this because I'm a man, because I'm a race, because I'm a whatever you deserve, nothing, don't deserves anything, right?
And like, ah, just like, drives me, what like nuts.
And, so, what's interesting?
And the kind of corollary true that of the whole deserve, Being thing mindset because like as soon as you think you deserve something, it means you stop and you expect the universe to give which never happens.
5:38
Right.
No one's going to stand there and be like oh hey deserve a hand out, right?
Like for me deserve is like a Pity.
It's like I deserve to be pitied like I never want to be pitied, you know, me like ever in my whole life.
Never and so from observing standpoint, what's interesting about this is that Hey guys, love that.
6:00
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, I think that the game is rigged because I think if you don't think you deserve things at all like you deserve nothing.
6:29
Then what's interesting is that you can take the actions while still being undeserving and get the thing that you want just weird, right?
Like you can be an undeserving shit, right?
And not be the perfect person, right?
6:45
Because no one is and still be able to get what you want by still doing the things and so it's as weird place where you're like I don't deserve this life and I'm like I don't deserve these things but I can still enter the cheat codes and do Do the things to get there and still get it even though I don't deserve it.
7:08
And so it's just it's just a wild ride and it's it's kind of tripping with my head a little bit as we're like about to go on this vacation to some really nice resort.
It's going to, I don't know, I'll let you know how it goes.
It feels weird because it just doesn't feel like me, you know what I mean?
7:26
Like, you know, I'm wearing 14 dollar freaking Champions, you know, that I've been wearing.
I've only have two Years of these.
And I alternate the same blue pair every day.
You know, I don't know if it's like, I've got a whole, not this one of my other ones have holes in.
I just don't get it.
7:41
I mean, it's like, it's just not me.
So I don't know if it's because I don't want that.
I don't want that to change my identity.
I don't want to get soft.
You know what I mean?
Like, I don't want nice things like, oh, I can't take a shower and anything but marble, you know what I mean?
Like, I just, I just don't want that to rub off on me.
7:59
And so, it's this weird thing of like, I got it.
It's like I'm like not even sure if I want to enjoy the vacation because I don't want to want, I don't want to want a vacation, you don't know me.
And I don't want to think I can't wait to the next vacation because then it's like it's going to throw off the game.
8:17
Like I want to be on vacation and hope and this is what's happened, every time.
It's like I go there and then I'm like man I can't wait to get back to work so I can like move forward anyway.
So we're going on this thing and I will I'll let you know if I, if I crack some code of figuring out how to how to be there.
8:36
Enjoy it while, also not feeling like I'm getting soft, you know, to the game that anyways, I hope you guys have an amazing Friday.
I hope you guys have amazing holidays.
I may make something while I'm there, may not, but I hope you guys just have an awesome holiday time period.
8:53
I hope you guys are prepping and getting your teams ready for the day after Christmas from the 26th.
The 31st of December is one of the hottest sales week since This everyone is off.
Everyone is just doing nothing feeling bloated.
And then, you know, from all the holiday parties and all the eating out with the family and all they see is New Year coming and the impending.
9:13
This of the fact that they are not better than they were last year and they're actually heavier.
And so that is the time we need to bring them in.
Show rates are higher, people got time and you can pre-sell and go hard.
And that's actually one of the things, one of the other reasons is like I've never really did the vacation that I went back home twice when I Years of owning the gyms.
9:34
And I left within 48 hours, I supposed to be there for like five days and I left within two days because I was like, I just can't do it this.
Like I was like, I got stuff.
I got to prepare for.
I got ya, I got shit to do.
I was like, is we're about to go into the heavy season and starts the day after Christmas.
And so, anyways, maybe you guys resonate with that haven't taken off a, you know, like a holiday season in a long time.
9:56
I'm still, we're still obviously back the day after Christmas because like we got shit to do, but But anyways, I hope you guys are gearing up.
You guys have some good campaigns planned, if you don't have campaigns plan, please?
Dear God planned, something externally and internally as an internally to your existing membership base.
10:13
A big referral Play.
Bring friends, you know, a free challenge, a non-free challenge whatever, bring people in.
You got a market.
If you're like, I'm not sure we're going to do like, decide on something, you have to do something and easy.
Easy process for that is start ten days out, you know, five emails.
10:31
Five texts lead it to an event in the sign up.
Alright.
Doesn't have to be super complicated, put a couple Facebook post with you and your trainers like just don't don't get crazy with it.
Everyone wants to like this is like the Black Friday time.
Like everyone wants to feel better about Fitness like let them do it.
10:47
So just just open your doors and accept what they're giving out.
All right.
Five texts lead it to an event in the sign up.
Alright.
Doesn't have to be super complicated, put a couple Facebook post with you and your trainers like just don't don't get crazy with it.
Everyone wants to like this is like the Black Friday time.
Like everyone wants to feel better about Fitness like let them do it.
So just just open your doors and accept what they're giving out.
All right.

Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do, that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
All right, so what I want to show you how to reverse engineer pricing A and B how How you can look at how to provide more value outside of the box.
Welcome, to the gym Secrets podcast.
0:36
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Hey, what's with everyone?
Hope you guys are having an awesome, a terrific Tuesday in your week.
I wanted to talk about a topic that honestly in almost every time I have a, some sort of Consulting day or coaching one-on-one, especially with.
1:00
Higher level business owners in order 15 10 million a year.
Plus this just never lie, gets brought up and so I wanted to dive into this a little bit more for those who don't know what the value equation.
Is it something that I have not seen anywhere else?
1:17
And so this is just kind of like how I view and how I put it together and it really works well.
All right.
So what I want to show you how to reverse engineer pricing A and B, how you can look at how to provide more value outside of the box.
Okay, so the value equation is four pieces to it, alright, to on the top part of the equation, 2 on the bottom part of the equation.
1:36
All right?
The top part of the equation is two pieces.
One is perceived outcome.
All right, so this is the plus side, this is the big part.
So if this were an equation, this is what's going to generate the upside, right?
So the perceived outcome that a prospect has of what they think they're going to achieve by buying your service information, product, whatever, right?
1:54
And so it's like, for for Fitness, for, I'll tell you all for and then I'll give you different examples, all right?
So that would be the perceived aapke Hain Fitness to be energy.
Look sexy feel good.
Great body, right?
The second part of the top of the equation is the likelihood of actually achieving that, right?
2:10
So that's whether the prospect believes that they're going to achieve this outcome.
All right, so that's where a lot of times we as marketers Etc.
Salespeople is we try and add in lots of social proof to increase.
Someone's conviction and therefore, charge a higher price.
Get more value, right?
2:26
I would say the first half of my career probably more than that.
The first 70% of my career are focused on the top part of the equation.
All right, which is Big perceived outcome, lots of increasing likelihood of success of achieving Janka, right?
That should be it, right?
2:44
But it turns out, there's actually two two more pieces of the equation, right?
You have the bottom half, this is the detractors.
These are the things that pull away from the value of the price that you're able to charge, right?
So the first part of the detractor, is the delay.
All right, so, that the amount of time between when they give you money, and when they're actually, To experience the perceived alcaman they think they're going to actually achieve it, right?
3:05
So let me give you just two different examples, an example, there would be like Fitness, right?
You, you saw someone on a transformation program whatever realistically, we know, and they know that it's going to take them 6 months, 12 months to really achieve the look that they actually want and maybe even then they still haven't achieved it.
3:23
So massive time to lie, right?
And so, that's number one, on the detractor side?
Yeah, I imagine if you could, they could pay And you snap your fingers and they have the they have the body, they want right in front of you, do you think you'd be able to charge more hell?
Yeah, right now the third sorry, the fourth piece of the equation.
3:40
So the second detractor from the equation is the actual the effort that they have to put in and you can put time and effort in there because time as a function of how much effort they have to put it in not time as a delay, right?
And so, in a fitness example, it would be.
All right, you can't eat the foods.
You want, you have to wake up early, you have to be sore, you can't eat with the family anymore, right?
3:59
These are all the things.
Things that they have to.
These are the sacrifices that they have to put forth in order to either.
Press, you got them right now.
So if we're looking at this equation and we're looking at it with a fitness example, right?
I'll go through all four real quick just as a recap perceived outcome.
Big sexy feel good bikini right likely to success let's be real kind of love right?
4:18
Do we really think that they're going to achieve the big bikini?
We're going to try and get them pumped up and we also know what percentage of people fall off, right?
And what percentage of people actually make it all the way they're very, very slim and they know that to we're trying to Delay their disbelief during a sale but the reality is that a lot of people don't succeed right now detractor.
4:36
It's going to take months and months and months.
So that's a negative and then how much effort they have to give up all the time and effort to change their entire lives, right?
Which is why for Fitness, for example, people don't go onto websites and one, click order a 2000, 3000 dollar personal training package, could you imagine if that were actually how it worked, right?
4:55
It doesn't work that way and that's why we have to spend 60 Minutes arm wrestling.
Someone You get them to take the decision to change their life because we only have one of the four value pillars in our Corner, which is just that we have a really good perceived outcome, we're going to change your life are going to transform.
How you look how you feel your energy you sleep, you know everything right.
5:13
But the rest of the for are not that good right now I'm going to give you two examples that I'm going to talk about how we can use this to increase your value for you and kind of where I've kind of evolved in terms of how it my thinking around it.
So I'm going to give you a different example than Fitness, right?
Let me give you an example round.
5:29
Relaxation.
All right so same perceived outcome is increased subjective.
Well-being, increased happiness, increased feel good feelings, right?
Such a proceed outcome.
Let's say we're going to use meditation, all right?
So that would be your.
That would be the vehicle that were using here perceived Alchemist, chill, chill.
5:45
Great feelings.
The likelihood of achieving meditation probably pretty low, right?
Because let's be real people really distracted.
You have to learn how to do it if this across.
Like there's there's effort and skill, it has to go into it right.
Time to let It might take you 60 days before you actually a good right, might take your time to get there.
6:04
And then the last piece is, is the effort and sacrifice feeling stupid feeling.
You can't focus constantly, you know, failing at doing this, all right?
And so in this equation, you have like one big bonus one, good one and then maybe like a half on the likelihood of achieving it time delay might be you know 30 60 so it's less than Fitness, right?
6:24
But overall not huge value, right?
And that's why meditation is not like a Of industry.
It's not like as big as weight loss, you know?
I mean, it's just like it's so so value.
Now, what I want to show you is how if you change three of these other pieces, but you keep the perceived out from the same, how you can massively increase the value of the product, right?
6:44
So, same perceived outcome, chill.
Relaxed feelings right now.
Let's say we're using Xanax as our product.
Alright?
Likelihood of achievement, right?
Second part of the equation.
Skyhigh, right.
How do I how confident do I feel that?
6:59
I'm I feel chill and feel good after I take Xanax, virtually, 100%, right?
What's my time?
Delay, 1530 minutes, I mean maybe 10 minutes if you Mainline it, I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding, but sure right.
I'll have to wait a long time for that to happen and then what is my what is my, My Sacrifice?
7:18
The effort have to put forth nothing I swallow a pill and you know, drink some water, that's it.
And so what's the difference right between meditation and Xanax is the same perceived outcome, right?
Right.
But one of them is a gazillion dollar, you know, pharmaceutical brand.
And the other one is something that there's really no, like main priors in the meditation, you know me.
7:36
Like, there's, there's no huge economic, boom.
In the meditation space, right?
This is not, and it's because of this value equation.
So let me let me tell you about what I have been thinking about a lot more recently.
So I would say the first three quarters of the time that I was in business.
7:52
I focused much more on the top side of the equation.
I focus all my attention on, how can I increase the perceived value of the service that they're providing how high it?
Chris the likelihood that they're perceived - achieving the outcome, right?
That's why we have tons of social proof.
We have, you know, big bike.
Let's see what Jim was, right?
8:08
I'm going to get you to increase your Revenue by two hundred forty thousand dollars a year.
Top Line.
Here's our average revenue per Jim.
Look at the Thousand testimonials we have.
For all of my focus is up here, right?
And now, when I talk to people who make a lot more money than me, and you're a lot smarter than I am, I noticed that a lot of them focus on the bottom side of the equation more.
8:27
And so, let me give you a tiny math example.
Then I'll show you how powerful this is.
So let's say you have something that's a small perceived outcome, right?
A small big top are the equation, but I make the bottom side virtually zero.
So I make the time delay, almost instantaneous and I make the effort and sacrifice almost zero.
8:44
So here's an example of that.
Netflix, did not change what we consumed, right?
They didn't change movies, they didn't change the TV shows.
In fact, they just put the same shows were already watching, but all they did was, they made instantaneous, right?
And we had Lino effort, we did have to get up to the store, we'd have to go to Blockbuster, we'd have to get our car.
9:03
We have to peruse the whole like we have to do any of that, right?
We just click it from our phone even and instantly seamlessly consume the things that we were already consuming.
So they didn't change the top side of the equation.
They change the bottom side, right?
And so, when I'm thinking about what we're looking at it, our business, all of my effort has really been put far more towards on the service side.
9:25
How can I decrease the time and effort for someone to achieve the outcome?
How can I decrease the amount of time?
It takes them to achieve an outcome and by doing that, you can increase activation fees like some value etcetera.
But it overall increases the value of the service or the product that you have, right?
9:42
And so, if you think about like Allen, which is coming out this Friday for our Jeweler Community, by the way, because I get asked about this all the time, I'm just an investor in the business.
I think it's an amazing product, I've helped in the formulation of it.
I'm not the sole owner all right, but I think it's awesome and so So it's a really big undertaking, it wouldn't just be me anyways what Alan does it's a software that works leads all right?
10:07
And so let's go through the value equation.
Hey guys, real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 leads but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
10:29
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads its hope free in exchange for email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller leads and so that you can not miss out on it.
Because last time I sold out for like Eight straight weeks really fast.
So, that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
10:48
So, the value is needs come in the door, right?
It's great.
I get 2 or 3x, my throughput.
Alright, awesome, right.
What's my, what's my?
Shoot what's the second part?
We're getting spotted by the equation.
What's the time to like its immediate, right?
11:03
Like as soon as you hook it up you don't have to do that anymore, right?
And then the effort and sacrifice.
What it does, is it removes all of the effort and all of the sacrifice that is typically customary with working leads, right?
And a lot of that comes from the interruption cost, right?
11:20
It's not that like, because on average, it takes about an hour to work lead and and if you worked it fully for 30 to 60 days, if you were to do it the right way, Brody's known doesn't most people don't do okay but beyond that the biggest cost is that the moment you get a lead, it becomes a 10/10 priority in your life because you could be writing it in voice, you could be doing contract, be writing on meal plans.
11:41
You could be talking to a custom whatever it is, it immediately takes your attention becomes priority number one, or it should be right, cause you're hot lead this right there.
And so what it does is it, it's the cost of switching tasks.
And so, if you do, they've done tons of research on this.
If you have two tasks that you have to do tasks and task B, and it takes you 10 units of time to do Beach.
11:58
Right?
If you are asked to do both of them together, it would not take 20 units of time.
It takes 70, or 90 units of time depending on the person simply by asking them to do both at the same time and us as business owners.
What we end up doing is working all day and getting nothing done because we're constantly switching between tasks.
12:15
And so the primary cost us something like an interruption based issue like working leads phone calls, Etc, is that it destroys the productivity of the person during the day, right?
It's also impossible to manage someone else's.
She at the pay rate that usually have to pay someone to do that for them to do a sustainable job and make sure that for every single week.
12:35
For the rest of the year, you always have sufficiently flow for them because God forbid, you have somebody who's supposed to work leads and you're not running a campaign right now, right?
And this person is literally just dragging overhead improving, providing a value.
All right?
And so my effort now and even the same thing on the done, female side is Ben, how can I make things seamless right?
12:54
Like I haven't changed food, right?
Like, you know, mean the briskets.
Great.
Don't get me wrong though.
The food tastes great.
It's amazingly well, packaged all of that stuff, right?
It's non-GMO, Etc.
But the real value comes from the pack that it removes pain.
It decreases the bottom side of the equation.
13:11
And if you think big picture about how you can provide value, there's a lot of opportunity.
Like most everyone focuses on the top side, myself included of the equation.
Let me promise more promise bigger tell tell people how they're like, you know guarantee.
But all this stuff right?
13:27
Where we're trying to increase.
They're, they're perceived likelihood of achieving the outcome, right?
Those two top sides of the equation.
But the more, I see the big companies, the billion-dollar, the 10 billion dollar companies, all I keep seeing is how they focus on removing barriers on how they focus on removing friction from the experience of a customer, like Amazon.
13:47
Like they've just made it so seamless for you to purchase something with one, click on a whim that by doing.
So, they've created more value than basically any other company out there right now.
It's not that even didn't even change.
What we're buying they didn't they literally didn't change what anyone was buying, they just changed how easy it was for us to do it.
14:05
And so when I think about Jim launch and I think about how we can provide more value.
Right now, all of my focus is, how can I get people?
How can I, how can I shrink the timeline that I can get someone to result, and how can I get them to do fewer things consume fewer videos.
Obtain fewer skills to achieve the result.
14:22
And if you can frame this with any business you're doing weight loss, if you're like, okay, how little can I get them to do?
How few To get you to acquire, okay?
Can I take the care of their meals for them?
Alright, that's done when they show up.
How can I get it?
So they don't have to think about anything when they're here.
They don't have to ask the instructor again.
14:37
How to do XYZ, like maybe even not show up to the gym if you're running a hybrid model like how can I remove the obstacles?
That create friction and create pain for a prospect.
When you do that then you can increase the value and the price.
Ironically.
And so this is where it gets kind of interesting is, if you look at a math equation, it doesn't matter what you have on the top side of the But if you divide it by 0, it's Infinity, right, anything / is your eyes is infinite.
15:03
If you guys, if you guys know that for math classroom, eighth grade math.
And so for me that's been really profound because getting the top side to Infinity is really really hard but focusing on decreasing the obstacles and the friction that a prospect has to go through.
Gives you a very tangible way to provide value by removing pain and removing friction.
15:24
And so it's been one of the things that when I'm talking to a higher level Whatever business owners it's like right now, you have too much friction right now.
It takes too many things for your customers be successful, right?
And so part of the reason, it took so long for us to get Alan out this because we had to streamline the onboarding process for the people, we're going to be coming in, right?
15:45
So that we can standardize the variables that we've now identified, there's a ton of variables that affect show rates which are mind-blowing, but how can we standardize that process?
So that becomes seamless for this person so that once they're done their onboarding experience, Audience.
And we know this that there's only 14 days, if someone sticks with Alan for 14 days and it's just because it takes 14 days to ramp up, right?
16:06
If someone passes the 14-day Mark, they step, they don't leave because they never won work leads again, right?
But it's that 14-day period.
We have to remove as much friction as we possibly can.
To increase the value of what they're receiving.
All right?
And so anyways, that's where all of my focus has been as CEO and I wanted to share that with you guys.
16:24
So maybe as a different way to potentially consider providing value, or even explaining, Ideal prospects.
Sometimes everyone promises the same things, you know?
I mean like if you look at the gym space right there's a zillion people who promise the same things.
I'll fill your jam on make you more money.
Don't work, less blah, blah blah, right?
16:40
Same promises right now.
Everybody's got testimonials right?
Some of us have more but everybody's got testimonials, right?
So then what other ways can you differentiate value?
And I think one of the biggest opportunities especially in the service space, because most people don't think this way is looking at the bottom side of the equation, because there's a ton of opportunity.
16:58
There.
And that's ultimately what, you know, I'm going to I'll tell you a fun.
Little side note story.
So I had a, I had a business owner who actually sells the gym owners.
All right, so he most people would see, like, this is a competitor of yours, right?
And they do about three hundred thousand a month and, and good guy, you know, I mean, it's a for everyone who's like worried about the small Ocean or whatever.
17:19
Like just don't be stupid here.
I mean like I'm helping this guy who's supposedly soliciting my member right and within First, you know, our I was able to get him to basically admit he's like my product isn't isn't as good.
Right.
17:34
And I was like I know that, but I'm glad that you said that right?
And the fundamentally his cost of acquisition was the same as ours was alright so our cost of acquisition his sales and marketing was was was fine but it is the same as ours.
The difference was the lifetime value of a customer in his business was eighty three hundred dollars left of our customer.
17:52
Our business is 42,000, that was the difference.
We made more per customer because we keep No longer and keep them making money longer and a lot of that comes from, how can we squeeze the time that I get someone to win how a few things can get them to do to still have this great result, right?
18:08
Reality is that most people don't do, most people aren't fucking consume the Legacy portal.
Like 90% of people who buy our stuff, don't even consider other videos.
If I'm going to consume 25% of the stuff and actually act on it, they win in there in friend, right?
And so that is everything like whenever we make a new like Jim watch portal update.
18:24
We try and make it shorter, not longer.
We don't try and add videos.
We try to take away videos.
How can we increase people's?
We decrease the friction and increase their speed and money because if we can work on the bottom side of the equation, the promise, which is always the same, the overall value of the product will go up.
And so that is where all of our focus is a team on.
18:42
That's where all of my attention goes as CEO and it also gives you an amazing differentiator for you to focus on how you can provide value.
But also how you can explain the value that you provide to your prospects, and your Marketplace differently is by focusing on the friction and the obstacles that you remove rather than yet again making a Huge promise like everyone else does because they're not original.
18:58
Huge promise like everyone else does because they're not original.









0:00
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into.
0:16
And if not keep enjoying the show in that moment, where pain is the highest work?
Tomorrow, it might not be there in the day before it was it because today's the day they walked in the door, so you always have that Advantage because you're in the Moment of Truth.
You're in the moment that they want to make a decision.
Welcome to the gym secret spot.
Last, we talked about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
0:37
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on, everyone?
Hope you guys are having an awesome Tuesday.
Are whatever do you listening to this?
If you've seen your car podcast, all I could stuff, hope you are rocking and rolling.
So I've been a little delayed in my making of content and that is because I've been making content in a different form, which is visual framework.
0:57
So I had the another 24 Frameworks and putting There, it might end up being like 36 by the time I'm done with it and it's going to be all around acquisition.
So it's just general acquisition strategies and really, you know, how we built three multi figure businesses using kind of different models than was traditional.
1:16
So one that I want to share with you today was kind of the five sales that you must do if you were selling service.
Alright.
And so sorry it's for sales but if you look at this beautiful thing, which if you're listening, then you can just kind of listen along.
There's four.
Sales that have to happen, right?
1:31
The first sale is your service sale.
All right, now you're not just selling one thing but you're going to Anchor high and then continually down sell all the way down.
All right, the second sale and I'm going to break down each of these sales, the second so that you need to have is going to be your bolt on sale.
So this will be the sales for ancillary services or products.
1:48
Alright.
So this would be for us in the gym space your nutrition sale, now in the nutrition.
So you're gonna be able to sell heart monitors, you're gonna be able to sell supplements, or maybe we'll sell meals and these are all things you're going to bolt on.
Client is going to buy these things.
Anyways, a lot of times per your recommendation, the third thing is going to be your continuity sale.
2:06
All right?
Which is, once you've gotten them in, you want to upsell the continuity and then the final said that you're going to make, is kind of prepay for the duration.
All right, so we'll walk you through this process works.
So when someone walks in the door and this is how you can actually maximize your client value.
Because right now, you're only like right now when people start working with us, right?
2:23
They're usually only selling one thing, they're doing it really poorly.
So someone comes in and they're like a, you know, you should sign up for, Membership.
And they had him a clipboard with prices and say, let me know if you have any questions work or they say, hey, just want you come work out for a week and then you know, let us know if you like it and we can talk about membership stuff that, right?
2:39
These are the typical ways that most people try and sign people up for memberships.
Problem is, it doesn't really work.
If you look at the math, you come in way, way behind a business that actually has about in process.
Like, you go to hurts, your not, they're not going to say.
Yeah, I like walk around the parking lot pegar.
2:54
Let us know if you like what?
Like, it doesn't work that way, right?
Because they understand the game, and if you want to win the game, Or at least keep playing the game.
You have to know how to play, right?
And so the first step is understanding the cells that you're trying to make so the service.
So we'll start there.
The entirety is that when someone comes in is the time when they are most excited to purchase right there, pain as high as they got in their car, they made time.
3:15
They drove all the way there.
And so the for some reason you cannot close someone on that.
Hi.
Layla, someone in that in that moment, then you're kind of missing something, right?
Because they came and in that moment, their pain is the highest wear it tomorrow.
It might not be there in the day before it was it.
Because today's the day they walk, Walk in the door.
So you always have that Advantage because you're in the Moment of Truth.
3:33
You're in the moment that they want to make a decision.
All right, so I believe that you should capitalize on that.
And so, the most expensive thing possible, and that also gets a higher investment from the client, which means that they're going to be more invested, both financially and emotionally because there's a transfer of energy there when they hand you money.
3:49
Now they're likely.
So if you want to be a coaching want to get people get results, you have to get them invested with part of the coaching job is to get some invested and if you can't do that, then you're missing out on the first and probably the most important.
Of what you are being paid to do.
All right, so back to our little drawing here.
4:05
Okay, so the service sale.
Now, you see that there's four sales into the service L that's because this is a downsell, all right?
Or an upsell Matrix, whatever we want to say it is that at each of these sales.
There's not just one sale, that's yes or no.
If they say no to the first one, you start on the second sale and being able to go through this and navigate it smoothly is going to be your skill set that your wanted to hone over time.
4:27
Alright?
So the first thing you're trying to is Diagnostics out Which is selling to go.
So.
Okay, Darth, you know, you came in for a 21 day, whatever.
Our 14-day, whatever seven day fix or 20 or six week detox, it doesn't matter, right?
They came in for a widget because that is the level of awareness that they came out on and that is the the offer they put on the front end.
4:43
That is getting clicks to get people in the door.
Great now we can both agree that after having spoken you want to lose. 40 pounds is not going to happen to 21 days.
Come here with that rather watch him start hacking off, body parts and and and neither of us want that, right?
Horrible, clean up for me and for you probably really difficult to workouts is that ha ha.
4:59
Okay.
Great.
So we can both agree on that.
Fantastic.
So why don't I just solve your problems that cool?
Great.
Notice the tonality here, right?
Is that we're going through the sale and they're agreeing with you.
They're like, no, you're right.
There's like, it's not going to solve my problem.
All right, so what it's going to take is going to take you wherever 24 weeks to hit your goals, can take other 10 to maintain it.
5:16
So, 34 weeks and all and it's only 99 bucks a week.
All right, you're gonna get me.
You're bubble ball, right?
Sound good fair enough.
She's gonna say yes.
Or should you be like, I can't afford that.
Really cool what you can do is you can just creep a today.
Do you just put it on a card then pay on your own terms?
5:32
Just like that?
We still switch from a painful to another paid in full.
If you still says no right then you can start decreasing the duration, right?
You can decrease the down payment.
You're like all right.
So instead of 3,000 a, how about we put 1,000 down today and then we can decrease your payments over time, right?
So instead of paying, you know, prepaying I can save you 10% off and you can put a thousand down and then it's a 90 on a week earlier, you have to pay sixty six weeks at work, fair enough and it should be like, yeah, I can do that.
5:55
Cool.
She can't do that.
They just like, you know what?
Maybe, maybe the time came, it is time to mentally.
Yeah, I'm not really sure if I like it.
Okay, cool.
How about this?
Why don't we just start with six weeks or 12 weeks?
Whatever you guys want to do, right?
And let's just get you some results first, and we'll go from there.
Fair enough.
All right, so let's just do 600.
There's no payments after that and we'll go from there.
6:12
Great.
So, when you anchor with a 3,000 dollar front end, right?
The Thousand down sounds like way less, and then the 600 feels like nothing, right?
And so, that is how you start down side.
Now, she still says, now and she's like, I hate you, your mustache is offensive to me, you know, my uncle has a mustache guy.
6:27
And I hated him and you remind me, okay.
I understand And so why don't we like can I just get you?
Can I just get your results?
First.
We just start there.
Okay, cool.
So I'm going to, I'm going to train for this one.
What is absolutely free?
All right, and what I need you to do is make them say you want to show up, you really want to get results?
Yes.
Great.
All right, so you need to make eight workouts during this period of time.
6:45
All right?
You need to make three appointments, all right?
The first appointment in 48 hours, which we're going to go over all your food, right?
If you're not gonna change how you eat, you're not gonna change how you look great, you understand?
Awesome.
The next one and all I'm doing is a point on the contract with are initially.
Alright the next one is a feedback appointment like I I can't change your program and make it more personalized.
7:02
If I do get feedback.
That's a I make sense.
Okay, cool.
So you're going to show up that appointment, you're initially here complaining with my finger great.
So the third one is your way up because I need transformation pictures, because listen, there's no way we're going to be to know if we made progress, I can't get an after picture from your before, so make sense.
Yes, fantastic certain initial here.
7:19
All right, so these are what you're committing to me.
I'm committing to training for free finish, 21 days.
All right.
And so, if you miss this as an added layer of accountability, this is the get you doing this because you said you struggle with accountability the past Easter Um, getting going sticking with it right?
Is that we're going to be $25, call it, call it fat tax, whatever you want to call it, right, motivation.
7:37
Tax to get you to show up that make sense.
Ha ha, ha great.
And so that way now, and I can get you results and still make it effectively free.
Thanks.
That's great.
And so just like that you went from three thousand dollar ticket to a thousand dollar ticket to a and that's that's not our front.
7:53
So six hundred dollars up front and you can probably split pay the 600 they say okay to that, then you can just close the trial.
All right, so no matter What everyone leaves with something.
All right, every human who walks in the door has to sign up, they don't sign up, you're not getting, you can't help them.
8:10
A most efficient quick break just to let you know.
We've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright.
So send me a connection request.
A note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
8:26
All right, so let's get back to the show.
Right.
And so, you should never lose anyone ever who walks in your gym, because everyone can sign up for free, all right?
And if you want to help them, you can still sign up for free and you have them put their car down for contingencies.
8:44
So it's a free trial with contingencies or with commitments, which is just that they're going to follow through.
So you can actually get the results which everyone will agree with when you're going through the sale because they said they want to get results.
You think you get results will show up the gym now?
Do you think you'll get results if you don't change?
You're really no.
Okay, so then just show up these points so you got it.
9:00
Like you have to do anything.
Just show up.
Fair enough, great.
Alright, so that is that is the step down on the service sale.
All right, now I don't want to make this an overly long podcast.
I'll probably just talk about the second sale.
Next video, I thought I can be able to make it through all of them, but it turns out that was probably the case.
9:16
So that is the first sale.
Mastering that first sale is going to maximize your throughput.
So right now, the average gym clothes is one out of three people who comes in the door, one out of three.
So if you want to be 3 times better, then, Your neighbor follow this sales process because here's how the math Break Stuff.
9:35
If you have, let's say, I'm going to do a multiple of 3, so it makes my life easy.
So let's say you get nine people who walk in the door.
All right, the typical guy is closing.
Three of them on a membership, right?
May be right, or maybe like, and he's getting 100 bucks, okay?
Now you are smart mofo and you're not going to do that, because you listen to these types of things, you're trying to grow and try to improve, right?
9:56
And so you're like, all right.
Well I'm going to close one out of nine or two out of nine.
Fine on a 25 hundred dollar prepay, right?
So boom, you're already a 5000 like if you close nothing else, you already crushing the gym across the street, all right?
But then you still have seven other sales, right?
10:11
And let's say you get two of the other sales at 1,000.
Okay, cool, maybe just one.
Let's just, let's not, let's not get over.
Let's go one at a thousand and then they got a contract on the back end.
The next you get 600 with a contract in the back.
End another one, you got 600, no contract and the rest of them.
10:27
So I think I just said five, right?
And the other for you just you Just get their card down, right.
So now all nine of these people you have the opportunity to get into continuity.
Now with the four people are in Trials, do you think they're out of the woods yet?
You think that we're just going to be like, you know what, we wish you the best and I hope that you'll come back and let me know if you want to stay for a membership.
10:46
Hell, no.
Because we're controlling the process here.
This is our Master out, and they have no internet.
So, That is going to bring us to cell number two, which is what we're going to do in the next 24 to 48 hours from every single one of those nine people.
All right, so we're talking revenue from just these nine shows the person that we're trying to compete against the guy, down the street who can barely pay his bills.
11:05
Which is hopefully not you because you're listening to, this is making $300, a nine shows.
All right, let me get 30 bucks, a show.
It is hard to be a missile to make it 30 bucks to show, right?
It's hard.
It's hard to Market hard, to acquire her to pay.
People aren't big commission's just work, right?
So that guy is making 30 bucks to show 9 /.
11:22
So whatever that math is things about 30 33, whatever.
All right, you are smart cat.
You got two people to prepay out of your nine.
You got 1,000.
It's got six thousand total between those three.
You got to 600's Downs.
All right, so those are your five.
So so you got whatever that is 7200, right?
11:39
And then you got four.
Trials are.
So you got 7200 compared to 300 your 20 times better or whatever the meth is twenty three or four times better, then the guy down the street and that is how one simple.
Tweak in how you sell, your service, can massively change, the the throughput, and the future of your gym or your service business, or whatever, is simply by catering the conversation and the reason that it works is because you're providing more value.
12:07
Because if you sell someone a membership, you're probably not providing as nearly as much value as someone who you just sold on 36, weeks of 101 accountability and nutrition and workouts, you know, training at your facility, who do you think?
Is going to get the better before and after picture, if we're looking nine months from now, right?
12:26
The guy down the street had three people sign up for membership.
Two of them are going to turn out in the first month because they got poor onboarding, right?
And so there's going to be one left to maybe meet someone is a little bit social and maybe they'll turn out a month five, right?
They probably won't get any before and afters but you because you learn how to have a have a value-based selling process that diagnosed right?
12:46
You're not practitioners disclaimer, right?
But figured out what the problem was so that you could prescribe a solution for them.
You're now able to cater your programs to people to provide more value.
So that at the end of that nine month period, you'll have two people who made it all the way through because already prepaid right?
13:02
One person paid 1,000 probably is going to make it all the way through because they put 1,000 down, that's a pretty big stick, right?
And then you've got the six hundred percent, which you probably got a 50-50 shot on and the trials may be one of the four actually makes it through.
That's okay.
But you went from one may be making it to 45, making it all the way through and because of that your business provided more value.
13:21
Simply because your Go to set expectations in a way that people could consume them as that, they can describe a monetary value to it.
And then become invested, which as coaches that is our job.
It's not programming.
Because if you can look up a workout on bodybuilding.com and look up a diet plan, the job of our job is to get people motivated and invested in doing it.
13:42
And that is why they pay us money to do this.
All right?
So if that makes sense, if you're not using this kind of selling process of starting high and working your way down and learning how to have that conversation smoothly.
Using reported using humor so that you can have it without seeming like a weirdo, then that will be something that the guy down the street learns faster than you and put you out of business.
14:01
So hopefully you are that guy and not the guy being put out of business.
So use this process on the next next installment.
I'll talk about the bolt on sales, the upsell process from there, there are multiple upsells and all of these are just one of her first 48 hours which will help you liquidate your exit acquisition cost pay payroll, cross pay onboarding process which are important because if you can on board and activate a client, well, Well, and you can liquidate that that cost then you're going to extend the life of other customer and also we make a lot more money and provide more value.
14:29
So anyways, keeping awesome have an amazing day.
I'll catch you guys on the flip side.









0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually a pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
We kind of seen a second one, it's just how we've always done it.
All right?
And so you use that line and just like that, you will get two cards.
Welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
0:33
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
I have a very short, very tactical tidbit for you today, how to eliminate two thirds of your declines, which for most of you is getting half of your turn or more is going to be coming from declined payment.
0:50
So not necessarily cancellations, but people whose cards don't go through and that you try and recover and then fail to.
And so, in the next couple minutes, I'm going to show you exactly how to not have that happen.
And so soon, as you get this to clients, you do this process and then you can recapture two out of three of them.
1:08
Which Got so it all starts at the sale starts the signup process.
So after you've closed the sale and you say, hey can I have your ID right?
It on the top and you say, hey, let me treat you for whatever card you want to use.
You get the credit card, you're at the credit card down and say, hey, it's you hold the card and you facing the prospect in your like, in case your identity gets gets compromised, or this car gets lost or you know, I'd anything like that.
1:31
What card you want to use as your backup card right now, half the time I'll just hand you the bill.
You can use this as my backup card, right?
If they're like now you can just use that one.
That's fine.
You just say we kind of seen a second one, it's just how we've always done it.
All right?
And so you use that line, just how we've always done it after you asked for the second backup card and just like that you will get two cards.
1:54
Now, if every one of your recurring members has two cards on file, as soon as you have the declines, you check the account, you swap the card, you run them all again on the back of card.
And Off to the Races, you go, this works for any recurring business whatsoever, get the backup card.
2:12
You can also use a CH has a backup, so it's like, if you want, if you don't use a card, you can use the, use your bank account or whatever card your husband doesn't say hahaha, right.
And so any of those things will work you should put both cards on the contract so that you're very you're authorized to Bill both of them.
2:32
So make sure that you have two spots where you can put it there.
Once you do that, you're good to go and just like that, if you start implementing this, you can virtually overnight eliminate two thirds of your declines, which for many of you be over half of your turn.
Alright so I hope that was useful for you, think Ed turning, who's here for the VIP day?
2:52
And that's one of the things he did to keep his turn low and he's got a stellar seven-figure plus champ and you should do that.
If you don't have money, Once you do that, you're good to go and just like that, if you start implementing this, you can virtually overnight eliminate two thirds of your declines, which for many of you be over half of your turn.
Alright so I hope that was useful for you, think Ed turning, who's here for the VIP day?
And that's one of the things he did to keep his turn low and he's got a stellar seven-figure plus champ and you should do that.
If you don't have money,









0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
The objective of a businesses is to make a profit that is the point.
That is what separates it from a non-profit, right?
And so it is my belief that you should take as much money as you can out, more than you probably feel comfortable with.
0:43
Welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going, everyone?
Happy Tuesday, hope you guys are rocking and rolling.
0:59
I wanted to talk about something that's a little different than the actual business, but very important, which is just about the money of the business.
So I'm just calling this one to take chips off the table.
So, as business owners, you know, we're always trying to grow were always trying to reinvest in our businesses and a mistake that I see happen.
1:17
Many many, many times and something that I made earlier on in my, my business career was reinvesting in the And so, there's a difference in my mind between reinvesting in the business versus reinvesting in yourself.
I think you should always reinvest in yourself, but reinvesting in your business, your business may come and go, but you will always stay, right?
1:36
I mean, as long as you stay alive, right?
And as long as you keep playing the game.
And so the whole idea here is a lot of people like, wow, you know, I didn't take anything out because I wanted, you know, reinvest it and grow.
The thing is if you like you really think about it, there's your reinvesting growing because you're trying to make money but the thing is they're kind of like counter to one another Which means that at some point, you have to decide.
1:57
I'm going to take this money and keep it for me, right?
And it's hard because you're like, man, some of that money that I'm taking out is money that I could be using to grow, but the thing is, is what is the end game, right?
And so if the endgame, let's say, like, let's play out a couple different alternative because when I'm having my one day's, the VIP days at that one, guys are coming out.
2:16
A lot of times we get into this, which is like, what's the goal, right?
And so, if you have a gym, right?
A single location and you want to, like you enjoy running the gym, Joy that business the objective should be to make as much money from that business in real time.
Which means month-over-month you take as much money as you can out of the business in the business of serving you, right?
2:35
That's the goal.
Now, if your goal is then, you know what, I'd rather have multiple locations for me, in my opinion.
The only reason to have multiple locations is because you're trying to have proof of concept, so that you can then go into licensing or franchising.
There are very, very, very, very, very, very, very few, people who make a Subsistent substantial amount of money through owning multiple brick-and-mortar service businesses.
3:00
It's typically made on the licensing and franchising side because with each new location you take on more overhead, you take on more a cost Capital to open them.
And so like that nest egg that you had then gets blown into this new thing.
And if you have a hiccup, all of a sudden the nest egg in all you built at one disappears into, right?
3:19
And so the objective of a business is is to make a profit that is the point.
That is what separates it from a Profit, right?
And so it is my belief that you should take as much money as you can out.
More than you probably feel comfortable with and that'll put you into a place of needing to make more money to pay you, which is good because it means you actually think like a business owner, like you're trying to make money rather than just trying to build something, right?
3:44
And what's weird, is that a lot of times when you think from the frame shift of shoot, I really need to make money.
You tend to make money, right?
And that means that your business actually gets better.
It's kind of backwards, but it's true.
I mean, I'm sure most of you guys at some point have had to make payroll in three days or had to make rent in a week or had to, you know, get hit with a tax bill or who knows, right.
4:04
And you've had to make 5 Grand 10 grand 15 grand in a week and then you do, right?
And here you are still breathing.
And the thing is, is you still always have that skill set.
You just don't utilize it to feed yourself.
You only use use it to feed other people, which you can.
I can dig more into later, but you can think about that for yourself.
4:21
So, back to one, to take tips off the table, the only outcome.
Besides, you know, opening another location for the for the, for the desire to franchise or license that model would be an exit, meaning you're selling the location, but the thing is, is if you're selling the location, you're going to want to show as much profit as possible.
4:40
If you're consistently putting money back into the business.
Now this comes into accounting stuff but when you're buying more equipment, things like that.
A lot of that stuff's not going to be considered reinvestment, it's going to be considered, you know, equipment costs or upkeep which will take from the That you would get from that business and so if your desire is to exit your business at some point, then you want to take as much profit out of that business, as you can.
5:05
Now mind, you big full disclaimer, I do not know your business.
I do not know your situation.
Everyone is unique, having self awareness is key to making big decisions in your life, but just from like an overarching standpoint, this is something that I see all the time.
And so I figured out at least speak to it.
5:21
So, back to the chips if you're like, You should try to run as lean as possible.
You have to be incredibly distant to pull into.
Not just spend the excess on fun stuff or things that you think might make money.
Like you have to make an argument for like how is this thing going to make me this amount of profit.
5:41
So if it's like I'm going to go by four thousand dollars worth of equipment, I'm easy example.
Now if you know what your profit margins are, which the average home runs 12, a half percent margins average, I'm not saying necessarily you guys, but the average gym, I have a CPA friend who runs just gyms and is as 12 and a half percent, which means to make four thousand dollars in profit back, right back.
6:04
Then you're going to have to make eight times that in in Revenue to make the 4,000 back.
So you have to make an equivalent argument.
It's not.
Can I just make four thousand dollars more?
It's can I make thirty two thousand dollars more because I'm taking taking this off of bottom line, I'm taking this off a profit and moreover if you wanted to sell your facility you'll probably get three-ish three to four depending on the buyer.
6:26
But three times your earnings, your profit at the end of the year, right?
So if the profit at the end of the year is is five thousand dollars less, right?
That is actually losing you fifteen thousand dollars on your actual sale number, right?
6:44
Which again, so you're losing on the actual real.
Didn't real time but you're also losing on the actual valuation of your business, all right?
And so it's really difficult to make that money back.
Especially if I'm being real for the majority of people who are small business owners, the things that they choose to spend money on her stupid right now, that being said, I think that when you take the money out of your business, you should not just spin it on yourself on shit, right?
7:10
Spend it on learning more skills so that you can make more money, right?
That's typically, like, leveling up your skill set.
It is going to do more for you than probably anything that you can invest in the actual business itself, right?
In terms of buying stuff, your skills will make you money right way more.
7:29
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over 1,000 hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
7:44
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I push the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
And so that's what you should invest in beyond that.
8:02
It is my belief and I made a podcast about this that, you know, really unless you're making a hundred thousand dollars a month in profit or more this like, I'm just being real with you.
I think you should consistently spend money on acquiring skills because that's the problem, right?
8:21
If you're not making the money you want, it's because you're lacking a skill set, right?
And if you're if you feel like you're not like a skill set, then you're lacking a character trait or you have a belief.
'F about the world that is false, right?
It's just false.
And so you have to figure out what that belief is and sometimes that investment comes with going into communities connected paying to have access to people, who can break that belief for you, right?
8:41
I'm not saying me do whatever you want, but I'm just saying, like just having that approach.
And so, back to chips off the table, I'm like, I'm gonna go.
Make sure my a.d.d. stays in check, when you are running the business.
Every month.
Take as much as you can out, have a number that Drain the bank account to every single month and do that religiously.
9:03
Alright, you drain it and you rip the cash out, you stack it and you do that every single month, all right, you don't give yourself an excuse to, not to not take out money one month or so, I kind of close if there's only eight hundred dollars above the above the line, you take the 800 out, like, you have to be disciplined about that.
9:20
You drain the account, and the thing is, it'll keep you on it.
One of the habits that, that, that I did for a very long time.
That was extremely useful before before cash flow became kind of crazy.
Basically, until until we until we were doing more than 100,000 a day, I looked at the total bank accounts of all assets.
9:47
My personal, my savings, my, everything that was cashed that was Liquid across all accounts every morning and I told it up and so every morning, I knew exactly how much money I had across.
Everything.
And the thing is, if you look at that in the beginning, you're not going to do it.
It's going to be uncomfortable.
10:03
And if you do this, religiously, you'll have a mind for where your money is going.
You'll see a big pop anybody.
Hey, where did that go from?
And then you'll start to start, there's a rhythm that starts happening, you'll start seeing it this pattern on Tuesdays.
Payroll hits on on Wednesday.
We get our credit cards on Thursday, we get our ACH deposits, right?
10:19
You'll start seeing these hits and you'll start feeling the Rhythm and then you'll start seeing if something seems high or something seems low, right?
And just by being mindful, Full of that, you will make more money, I promise you because you'll see how hard it was for you to make the money that you made and see actually coming to your account, you won't be as quick to spend it, right?
10:40
So rip the cash out as much as you can if you're month because both that's going to increase your net worth, right?
Because at the end of the day, if you keep going and I saw someone had this happen to somebody, and this is why I'm making this for you.
I saw someone who quote reinvested in their business during the good times.
10:58
They're just making tons and tons and tons of money, right?
And then back times head, right?
Something happened, trainer, leaves takes half the clients, whatever, right?
And they had nothing, right?
And they ended up having to close their facility after three years of what was good times, but they do have a dollar to show for it.
11:19
Now if during the good times they have been consistently stacking cash, consistently stacking cash one, you have a parachute that if you need to switch opportunities you have That they're to from an emotional standpoint, you feel like you have something to show for what you've done.
I can tell you after having sold the gyms and then having a partner at one point, basically essentially drain the funds out of the account and then send it to somebody off shore.
11:42
The person been indicted for fraud twice and I just didn't know, I saw six, all my locations, all the money that I had made vanish, and I can tell you it's soul-crushing.
And I don't want that to happen to you.
And so don't, don't do that.
Just Just take money out every month.
12:00
So you have something to show for it, no matter what, what you have to show for it, the end of the day, at the end of this entire game, is who you are, right?
Is the character you've built is the belief that you have, and the skills that you've acquired, which create your reality, right?
That is truly going to always be the end goal.
12:15
But in the real material world that we live in, there are some things that money can do that can help make like money can't buy you happiness but poverty, can't buy you anything and I heard that the other day so it's not my quote, but the other side of his that money can't buy you happiness but I can sure.
Help you avoid pain, right?
I'll tell you that much like it can help you avoid pain in your life.
12:32
And so if you can smooth transitions out for you for your family, for whatever, your kid has a learning disability and it cost two thousand dollars a month to get some special tutor for them to learn how to read like that shit happens, right?
And for you to be able to be prepared for that will allow you to be prepared, right?
12:48
For when those types of things have.
So, take your Chips off every month, it's not helping you grow, your business, for most of you for the vast vast majority of You the things that you're investing in are not actually things are gonna help you grow your business.
So make it a priority to profit as much as you can every month and stop buying stupid shit.
13:06
All right, if you want to exit, it's still going to increase the value of your business by being disciplined in that process.
Because then you're going to show lower overhead higher profit and it's going to be more attractive to a potential investor in the future.
All right, so just don't make this mistake because I'm just telling you.
13:21
When the times are good, is when you need to take money out, that is when you need to do it.
That's when you rip your Cash out.
Like you think it's going to keep going, but the game of business is cyclical right after every good time, there's a bad time, right?
13:37
Every up Cycles followed by a down cycle and every down Cycles followed by an upcycled, but don't be like everyone else and think it's always going to be this way, right?
It's not like there's probably going to be something that's happening on the horizon, right?
Like the yield curve is flipped like we're on borrowed time right now.
13:55
So right now things are still get right economy.
Frothy take some chips off the table.
All right, because you don't know what's gonna happen.
So anyways I hope that was useful.
I hope right now if you could think to yourself, man, there's some extra money in my bank account right now.
What should we do with it?
Take it out right.
14:11
Run a paid in full play every once in a while, right?
Just take some scrape, some cash off.
Make sure you run internal plays to, You're Just in clients, at least four times a year because that's just pure excess profit and you shouldn't reinvest in the business.
You just take it right out and you put it in the bank of you.
All right?
14:26
Because number one thing that is Guaranteed to make you more money is more money.
So if you take the money out, it's guaranteed to actually increase your net worth.
Whereas if you invest it, it is not guaranteed to do that.
And likely if you look at it from a profit standpoint, if you're doing 12 percent margins or even 20 percent margin, you have to make five times at investment just to make it back just to make it back.
14:49
Alright?
So just be super mindful of that.
Hope you guys have an amazing Tuesday, hope this was valuable for you.
I'll come back at you with you guys with that the second Art of the sale.
This one is on my mind.
So this what?
I was feeling like and comment.
If you do dig it, if you don't then I'm sorry.
15:05
But hopefully you did.
All right.
Lots of love.
Keeping awesome.
I'll catch you on the flip side by

Most Nation real quick.

There's a famous marketer who said for every dollar you give me.
I'll give you a thousand dollars back.
He ran an ad in the paper and got zero responses.
Welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
0:35
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Hello everyone.
And welcome back to I guess my show so anyways I guess you could call show, I don't know.
Thoughts anyways.
So um I wanted to make something so this called the offer is King and that's because the offer is king.
0:53
So if you have a good enough offer you don't have to sell hard, you don't have to have amazing copy or amazing creative.
You just get a lot of people to sign up for your thing.
And so if you really think about your business, most businesses should be founded on a core.
1:11
Offer.
That is exceptional like an irresistible offer that is what it's going to grow the business, right?
And so what I want to walk you through is three really good.
Offers the three components of those offers and then seven ways to ethically use free.
1:29
So, we're going to cover a lot of ground really fast, so three of the greatest authors of all time were Domino's offer.
Some guys may remember this, but it was delivered to your door in 30 minutes or It's free.
Right?
That's an irresistible offer and they had shit pizza.
1:45
But because of that people wanted to make the order.
They have to sell them on it.
They saw the offer and when they were hungry, they were like shooting, 30 minutes.
I can do that.
I can have pizza at my door and sometimes it's almost gamification.
Almost a challenge.
That's like, well, if it's not in 30 minutes, I get the pizza free.
So it's it was something that was incredibly compelling.
2:02
It was one of the fundamental keys to their growth.
And why back in the days of Yellow Pages?
It was literally an entire section was pizza and other restaurant.
Had a food category of Peace.
Everything else is just Restaurants, right?
So any of you that was because of that one key ears as well offer.
2:17
Alright, the next was 10 CDs for a penny, right?
And this was from, I think there's so many way back in the day.
Now, obviously it came with continuity and so that was kind of like the first trial offer but that offer is one of the single greatest golfers of all time for.
Those are old enough to remember it, the third offer you may recognize which is when it absolutely has to get there by tomorrow morning and that is FedEx.
2:41
X.
So notice the first to kind of have a pricing component, FedEx does not but it has a really high value component to it.
So I just want to break down these things into three pieces.
Each offer has a component of believability, right.
2:57
There's a famous marketer who said for every dollar you give me.
I'll give you a thousand dollars back.
He ran an ad in the paper and got zero responses, right?
That is a crazy offer, but it's so good that it's not believable and literally no one responded to the ad, right?
And One of the things that makes offers believable as having a reason why that you would do this, right?
3:17
If you're like, hey, I'm you know, I'm dropping all my prices by half off because I all my inventory is going to go bad.
People believe that they're like, okay, or like I'm overstocked and I got to make room for, you know, new new inventory, everything's half off, people believe that.
It's a good reason why I write.
3:33
So believability is number one.
Number two is a high Roi offer.
So basically an offer that people deem valuable that can be communicated.
Skated in a couple of words like guarantee you to your door in 30 under 30 minutes, that was valuable for FedEx.
It was at, you know, delivered to wherever you need to be or wherever it needs to go by next morning.
3:52
That is valuable, right?
You can give offers but if people don't find it valuable, it's not going to matter, right?
And so the third piece is kind of the business around it, right?
And so that's kind of what I want to cover with free offers, because you'll notice the penny offers basically free, the Domino's Pizza offer has a free component to it, and so Understanding how to use free as a marketer is probably in my opinion.
4:16
The single most valuable thing that you can learn how to do.
It's learning how to build a better mousetrap.
And so right now, I'm working on a book called acquire, the subtext is building a better mousetrap, which is just kind of like, how to structure offers in a way that you can get tons of volume but also make money on the offers, right?
4:35
And so, this is a, you know, my notes for the different ways that you can use free offers.
I think I've 7 on here, so I'll walk you through them.
Pretty quickly to just kind of explain them.
So the benefit of having free offers is that you get the highest volume of leads, right?
Number one, number two, it's typically the lowest cost to acquire customers.
4:54
So this number 2 and the third is that, in my opinion, the key to having massive growth is to having a free offer, right?
And especially something, that's irresistible that can spread through Word of Mouth that other people can comprehend.
All right?
So first, if the free offers is a free bribe offer, right?
5:09
So this is where you offer a.
So, Someone comes in, you offer a program for free as a benefit for signing up, right?
So Frank Kern way back in the day did a he had all of his courses that he'd ever made.
So high value offer probably like 12 thousand dollars in value.
He said I'll give you all of the courses that I've ever made absolutely free.
5:28
If you sign up for my three hundred ninety, seven dollars a month, continuity?
Right?
My newsletter, whatever, right?
So that's a free bribe offer.
So you can use the word.
Free brings, lots of attention, has huge value in Roi, but it was a free with purchase, right?
So, that's kind of the idea is like, if you buy this much, Other thing you get this huge value thing for free and it's also really nice price anchor.
5:45
Okay.
So someone if you're doing Fitness thing, it's like hey are six week challenge is a thousand dollars or you can just sign up to become a member and get our thousand dollar challenge for free and only become a member for $200 a month, right?
That becomes really compelling offer.
Lots of people say yes and you get people straightening continuity.
All right, the second is a limited free offer unlimited.
6:03
Free offer is let's say, this isn't a be closed when someone walks in the door, obviously the vast majority people listening, this, our gym owner.
So I'm going to just make it Jim.
So if someone's coming in you say, okay, the free thing, let's say you sign up for a 14 day or let's say it's 28 day, you sent you come in for 28 a promotion.
6:20
The free thing has one, you know, you could say 28 day trial they come in.
It's one day a week of workouts you have no personalized nutrition known to trip.
No accountability coach right now during the sales process, they'll have already said.
They're not motivated, they need help.
I'll well and so then you upsell right as American as apple pie a 28 day challenge or 28 day intensive or whatever you want to call.
6:41
Our where they they pay 199 or 299 or whatever.
For the enhanced version that has three workouts a week or unlimited workouts and personalized nutrition and an accountability coach.
And if they don't, you know, lose 10 pounds in the first 90 days, you give them another 28 days, free, right?
6:58
So you have an upsell from an initial offer that makes it incredibly compelling, right?
That's the point.
So they get all this volume for free, but then, you can still upsell three out of four people into a paid offer.
Alright, so that's how you use free and you can monetize it.
The third way of using freezer free trial plus penalty.
7:14
So this would be a down.
So it so these can be used in conjunction with one another.
So if someone doesn't take that that you know, the a be closed that I just mentioned, it's a awesome.
If you're going to stay then you have to put a card down because you want to be held accountable.
You have to work out this many times.
If you miss your workouts we're going to charge you for the missed workouts and you have to attend the, you know, a feedback session and a transformation picture session and a nutrition session, right?
7:37
If you know, show any of those that's 50 bucks and so they have a huge motivator to actually consume your product or service so the likely they convert on the back and a significantly higher.
Right.
That's the point and so that way at least your trials become more qualified trials are more invested and it's a really easy close to close someone on on a free trial if you can close free, Charleston.
7:58
You have other issues.
Hey, if you're a return listener and you have not rated or reviewed the show, I want you to know that you should feel absolutely terrible about yourself and everything else in the world.
I'm kidding.
But it would mean the absolute world to me.
If you guys would go ahead and do that, you don't have to pause the show, you keep listening and you can just do it with your thumb right now will take you less than 60 seconds.
8:17
And like I said, the only way that podcast arose through word of mouth and this is you joining hands with me and helping as many isomers of possibly can because no one is coming to save us, it's just us.
All right, so please go do that now.
Then let's get back to the show.
Okay, the fourth one is a free with deposit.
8:36
So this is a classic the old 6p challenge that we ran for a very, very, very long.
Time was probably the most popular fitness off.
For the last decade was a free six.
We challenge.
Obviously, it would have to be compliant, put stipulations for any types of things things on your advertisements States, differ etcetera.
8:53
But that's where if someone hits a goal they do an outcome, they can get their money back or get it credited towards something so it's like it's free with a contingency.
So it's like you put Tax dollars down.
If you do x, y and C, you can either get it back or you can get it towards program, whatever, right.
9:08
That's kind of the pitch there.
So, it's a free with deposit.
So, free with stipulations.
All right, the fifth way of doing free is free forever, and this is a really compelling offer.
So this is where you have to really know how your mouse trap works, right?
So if you have multiple ways of monetizing a customer, I could say, for example, I will train you for free for legitimate free.
9:29
Like, I will give you a free training, straight up your membership is free forever, right?
As long as you just do the things that I tell you to do, which may include buying supplements from us, that's part of the program.
Now, a good friend of mine owned a chain of shade of franchise of weight loss clinics, and they made only like five percent of the revenue on service and they made 95 percent of the revenue on supplements.
9:54
And so people would come in and they'd essentially give the the service away for free but they were required to use the supplements as a part of it.
So that's a free. 100% free but you're you're bolting on a different revenue streams that's where you can offer multiple services and monetize it different service than the one you're giving away for free, right?
10:14
And especially if you have something that's high margin, you can give that away for free.
If something's high margin and low value, it's an easy thing that you can give away for free and then give something else away.
That's prior perceived value or make them buy something, that's higher perceived value.
People tend to appreciate physical products more than they appreciate.
10:32
Or value service.
All right, so that's kind of a free forever model which is really understanding that how you can monetize.
The second need the next thing they're going to need after the first thing.
The six-way is a free giveaway.
This is a classic, you know, you run, you run a free giveaway.
10:51
Let's say meals for a month, right?
I'll pay for all your food from, I'll pay for your whatever, right?
And you get tons of people going to opt in for that.
And you say like, well we you know, we picked one person, but if you still do the program it's this Us and we'll give you a discount since you, you know, signed up, right?
As, you know, sign up to be a part of it.
11:07
So the thing is, when you have this, people are still raising their hand to demonstrate, they have a need for the service, right?
And so if you have a giveaway, that's perceived as high value and something thats related to the core offer that you have, you instantly get tons of very cheap leads that are qualified for the service.
11:24
All right, a good friend of mine just started running a 25 thousand dollar transformation Challenge and he's getting people to buy without even doing phone calls.
Straight on the page because it's a 25,000 dollar Challenge and it's like 300 bucks to sign up online.
So people are seeing the huge giveaway and they're choosing to participate to have the have the have the chance to earn that right now obviously with giveaways and things like that, you always have to make sure you're not gambling, all that kind of stuff, but I'm just talking, big high level marketing.
11:53
Alright, the next and probably last one of these seven, there's probably more.
These are just the ones.
I thought off the top of my head is a free with With free with commitment.
So not contingency, but commitment.
So, that's where you say.
Your first 28 days, or your first month is free, as long as you commit to a nine-month contractor, we commit to a whatever, right?
12:16
And so when you do that, you can still mark it, free you.
So you'd have to again put the contingencies in.
You want to be compliant, Advertiser, but that way, you can still give people free on the front and it makes the sale.
Very easy puts a little bit more of the onus on the Fulfillment.
But if you get the commitment, which you should, Then you will be able to convert a very high percentage to keep on the front end and typically at higher average contract values because they're not confirming that price on the front end.
12:41
It's more like receive value on the back end of their kind of sort of going to see how it goes right now, that being said during the process, you still need to sell the people even if you're not closing them.
So even if someone has their Colorado file and it's planning on rebelling, you still need to sell them on stay.
So just a big mistake that I see happen all the time is that when people get trials and things like that, they're not actually they just sell the trial rather than In the continuity selling someone on a trial is just selling them.
13:05
On trying it, you have to still sell them again.
Even if they're on, you know, Otto bill or whatever.
Because the thing is, you know, 30% of people who go through it immediately, call you up and say, oh no, I didn't mean to let that go through and then you have chargebacks all sorts of crap.
So you don't want that, make sure they know they're gonna get build.
And if it were me, I'd probably only build the people that I knew had been sold in that kind of, at least verbally agreed to it.
13:27
We already have the contract but at least I know that they're in.
So those are seven ways.
To make free offers to get lots of people in the door and make irresistible offers.
That will also really make you more money.
So learning how to monetize, free, as one of the biggest Tools in your skill, set in your toolbox, and if you don't know how to do it, you will be at a significant disadvantage because your competitors will be and they can acquire more customers at a cheaper price than you do.
13:53
And if they can monetize them in the ways that I just outlined and you just know the metrics, you know what percentage convert what percentage.
Stay with the average ticket is and that's why knowing the math is so important.
Don't.
But if you know those metrics then you can mark it with Reckless abandon because, you know what your LTV is and you know that you can win based on those numbers.
14:10
So anyway so that was valid before you the offer is absolutely King.
Like if you get the offer right someone should be able to explain to someone else in like one sentence or two sentences.
What it is that the offer is if you can't explain it like that then it is not clear enough to a prospect and if you get the offer right, it will make you more money than you know what to do with.
14:02
Don't.
But if you know those metrics then you can mark it with Reckless abandon because, you know what your LTV is and you know that you can win based on those numbers.
So anyway so that was valid before you the offer is absolutely King.
Like if you get the offer right someone should be able to explain to someone else in like one sentence or two sentences.
14:20
What it is that the offer is if you can't explain it like that then it is not clear enough to a prospect and if you get the offer right, it will make you more money than you know what to do with.









0:00
What's going on, everybody?
I'm bringing some more books, but I wanted to say that, if you haven't checked out Hunter million-dollar offers, I would definitely suggest that you start there.
I've gotten some solid feedback and it couldn't be happier with its.
Number one ranking on Amazon for direct marketing and over 5,000, five star reviews.
So, thank you guys so much for that.
0:15
It's 164 pages.
I really can help you out.
It takes about four hours to get through, check it out.
On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
The audiobook is Lowe's, they'll let me put it on for it.
So I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast and these are All tiny little tweaks that you should do.
0:32
That will make you significantly more money.
Welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Good morning, everyone.
0:50
Hope you guys are having a awesome start to your day.
I actually slept the longest, I slept in a really long time and I feel like a newborn child anyways, but I wanted to give you for billing tactics to maximize margin.
You may have heard of two of them already at different times throughout the podcasts but I think it is worth repeating because if you have not done them then you should alright?
1:11
And so I'm going to start out with something different that of the fourth one that you have not heard me.
Say and these are all tiny little tweaks.
That You should do that will make you significantly more money.
All right, the first one is and this is gonna sound tiny, is adding 99 cents to all of your memberships and purchases, okay?
1:32
So everything that you sell in your business, whether it's t-shirts whether its membership fees, whatever challenges doesn't matter, right?
Adding 99 cents to every single.
One of those things you're doing hundreds of transactions a month, right?
If you just add that extra dollar, like overnight, you have Three hundred four hundred dollars a month that just appears magically to you.
1:53
All right.
And like I realize this one time when I had done a big launch I'd signed up, it was whatever was around was like 100 and and that's number one.
The second one is I go for the the, the 99s instead of the 97 super, like it's 497 right versus 499.
2:10
I'd signed up, almost 200 people in a challenge and I realized that, by giving up, that there's $3, I was given up six hundred bucks for that month and I I'd rather make an extra $600 inside charged everyone for 9999 at the time.
2:25
That's when I was charging 500 bucks.
And so all that to say those little those little pennies and sevens and 99s actually add up when you look at the fact that you're doing high volume, right?
You're doing hundreds of transactions.
And so if you're at 167 bumping, don't, you know, one 6999 for all of your stuff will instantly add a lot like real money to your bank account.
2:49
It may sound completely insignificant, you can probably bet you.
You probably even sneak it in and be like, hey guys, just because I want to standardize everyone.
Some people are kind of all over the place.
Everyone's just it's going to be one 6999.
Hope it doesn't bother.
No one will mind, right?
It's not even it's not even a sale, right?
3:05
And just like that, you can generate a $600 a month.
Now if you're like huh Alex, I don't know why I would care about that.
It's like, well considering the average gym owner makes 30 grand a year.
If you could add seven thousand two hundred dollars a year to year your paycheck by not adding anything.
That sounds like that would be a good idea, right?
3:22
So, that billing tactic.
Number one, use the use your sevens Tournament of nines, and then make sure you add the 99 cents on every transaction that you're doing.
And it will add up Chinese at a right.
So, that's number one, number two, I give it to you yesterday, but it seemed just like, make sure you get the backup carts.
3:42
So make sure you get a backup card on the people who you are selling because it's just going to decrease your turn.
So if you Can decrease your turn from ten to five, simply by having the card on file.
You'll make way more money.
You just cut your turn in half through an administrative tasks rather than having to implement all of these operational systems to save people.
4:01
It just adds another way for you to collect more money and literally like one you know a card.
If you think about it, if you had 10 people were supposed to cancel and five of those people, you have the card on file and you Bill it you know whatever 170 a month, you just made $850 because that month and maybe that Every month thereafter because of something you added on the front end and so it's like, okay, billing tactic number one, got a $600 a month.
4:27
Building tactic number two, got us $850 a month now.
We're up 1450.
All right, let's see if we can find some more pennies here.
Alright so that's number two.
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
4:42
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
5:05
Number three is the one that I've said a zillion times over and so people don't do it because they pay money or whatever they do, hate having hard conversations.
They change is that if you switch from a weekly billing, Cadence a monthly billing, Katie's to a weekly billing Kate, it's and it doesn't have to be weekly.
It can be every every week every other week, every 28 days, as long as you run a weekly cycle, there are 13, four-week blocks in the year and there are 12 month blocks in the year and because of that, you get one extra fooled.
5:34
Billing cycle per year than you would otherwise, if you're on a monthly schedule and dollars to Donuts, most people actually do their payroll every other week.
And yet, they bill monthly.
So what ends up happening is that, by the end of the year you had 13 payrolls and you had 12 inflows.
5:52
So 13, outflows 12 and flows, which means that one full month of payroll by the end of the year, just gets stomached by you, right?
You're just a nice, nice boss and you're just taking that one on the chin, right?
So if you switch that Kate, You're going to get another, whatever, 7.8 percent per year.
6:08
Now again you have to think about what like everyone, everyone scoffs at these marks and things, but it's like a virgin's, making twelve and a half, right percent per year.
So if you add almost eight percent of that, you're almost doubling the prophet of the facility, right?
Like, it's kind of a no-brainer except I had, I had a higher little business guy who showed up at one of our Mastermind.
6:29
And I asked, I said, who here is on on the weekly billing, Cadence.
And he said, like, he looked around after I just give them that explanation and he saw that it was like 10% of the room and he's like, what the fuck is wrong with these people?
He's like, why are they not doing this?
This makes no sense to me.
He's like, I immediately used it in my business and so I don't know.
6:49
So if you're not doing it, I don't know.
Alright, so, first building tactic, turn yourselves into nines and add the 99s.
Second one, get the backup cards.
Third, one switch, the billing, Cadence.
And then the fourth one and this is is a this is a smaller one.
7:05
You can also use ACH.
So if you've noticed, maybe you have or haven't noticed, but Jim Lynch is actually almost exclusively run on ACH.
So, our clients are that like, really actually don't run a ton of credit cards, we run mostly ACH and we do that because there's lower processing fees.
7:24
And when I'm building a lot of money, an extra 2% actually is a significant amount, right?
And everything is relative but it's still, it's still material.
If you're doing a million dollars, a year 2% is 20 grand, right?
So like want to have all these little things, add up.
7:40
So we added a 600 dollar month, sets 7200 a year from the first tactic.
We added ten thousand dollars a year from the second tactics and now we're up 17.
The third tactic gives us a whole nother month of billing which are probably be about 20, right?
7:55
So now we're up 37,000, okay?
Just from these just a little little changes, thirty-seven thousand dollars that we just found and It's all bottom line.
It's my point here is that these little bottom line tactics sound like small money.
But the thing is is that if you're making 12 percent and you make thirty seven thousand dollars more than, it's just like you make it an extra 240 right?
8:20
Because 240 right to get an eighth of that, right?
Or whatever it is, 8 times, 8 times, 37, some or whatever, that would be 32 anyways, 300 Grand is what that would be the equivalent of making for you to get your 37.
So it's a very Big difference in terms of how much money you make, right?
8:36
And then obviously the 4th one if you can get your backup card or you can make it standard for most of your people to have the ACH on file.
Then you're going to save a ton in your payment processing.
So most people have most people process through their CRM, Gateway.
8:54
Typically most people don't know this either their CM gateways making the majority of their money on their processing, not on their fee.
So the fee is sort of additive but the majority of the money She is made and they have partnership deals on the actual processing where they're going to getting there, getting one percent, you know, back or one-and-a-half, percent back on your account.
9:13
When normally, if you if you're a local business and you go to a business that just as payment processing, you might process for 50 basis points.
So now again if you're looking at how much you make per year 2% and you're making 12%, normally it's just giving you another 20 percent pay raise.
9:31
So all of these things are for kind of Bill.
Tactics to maximize your margin.
I would I could I could really get into like, actually just like raising your prices on things but I won't for the time being you should raise your prices by the way.
9:48
But that is it.
I hope those were a tactical for you.
If you are not using them, you should use them like each of these little things.
Add up, you know what I mean?
And then when you have 20 or 50 of these little things that you do better, all of a sudden at the end of the month, at the end of the year.
10:03
You're like wow there's more money there than I expected and that's only if you have the discipline to not just blow money when you look at your account and see that you have money and then go spend it.
All right?
So as long as you have that, that discipline that character trait, in place that all of these tactics will make you more money and help your Jim Crow.









0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else, there have been a lot.
Of people that have talked shit about me.
There have been a lot of people who've taken public stances against me and a lot of those people.
I have helped a tremendous amount, welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
0:43
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on, everyone?
Happy Tuesday.
Come in into a late-night episode sexually way.
1:00
Past my bedtime, and it was a making this because it was on my mind and it's like, you know, what might as well just get it out rather than keep it in, so Grayson business.
So over the last, you know, four years, talk about a couple things that I think will be useful for you.
1:21
There have been a lot of people that have Talk shit about me.
There have been a lot of people who've taken public stances against me and a lot of those people.
I have helped a tremendous amount and have beautiful testimonial videos to support them in tears, about how we, you know, save their business later coming out and saying this thing.
1:46
So one of the lessons that I've learned is to have Grayson business and not just because of the whole human element, we're going to put that On pause for a second but just for business reasons.
Because one thing that I've learned is that Burning Bridges makes you no more money.
2:03
You cannot make any money from a bridge that's Bert you can make a money from a bridge that's been respectfully, you know, walked away from and there's even ways to say that you disagree with someone without burning the bridge.
Be like, I totally understand what they have going on there, we do things differently but I can appreciate that.
2:23
Everyone has their own way.
That's how If someone asks me about a different method or system, I'll typically respond and you guys have seen me take apart different things that I don't agree with him.
Like an, here's why that I don't think it makes sense, you know, math, just math wise, you know, independent of the person is just try and separate the idea or the concept from the person when you're making remarks, because here's what happens when you fast forward.
2:46
I've had multiple of these people who have been, you know, publicly against me.
Right talking, lots of shit.
Now, come ask if they can try and resell my products.
Right.
What do you think, right?
3:03
Like what happens now?
Like like what kind of position you put yourself in now, if you approach, you know, those types of relationships that you have in your life.
Like, with Grace, I'm not saying you're gonna agree with One.
You don't have mean you're not, of course you're not you're human, right?
3:20
But the way that you do things matters.
Just as much if not more than what you actually do, right?
Like two people can just stop doing business of the business, but one person can make such a huge fuss about it that the person who owns that business never wants to see their face again, right?
But no one might not know that depending on how that person carries themselves and she does give an example.
3:40
So, let me flip the tables for a moment.
Let's say you walk into a restaurant, right?
You walk into a restaurant and The hostess has a scowl on her face.
She's not looking.
You know, she's like, doesn't look like she's having a good day.
She's like hi.
3:56
Do you want a table and you're like, yeah, I was just hoping to be seated if and then she doesn't even look or say anything.
You just walks away and you're like, is she getting us a table or do we need to sit down?
And then she comes back and says, and then grabs you many as and just as this way and you're like, oh okay, got it.
4:16
All right, and you sit down all of a sudden your entire experience has been totally shifted by this first person.
Right.
And now you know you leave and you're like oh the food was okay staff is really crappy here, like you know, two-star review.
Now let's replace the word front Hostess, right?
4:35
At that restaurant, with your front desk, girl, or your trainer at your gym off to that point, you're like yeah you know what, that business probably didn't.
You know that business that business sucked.
Now we all have businesses and we all have employees who don't follow the fucking script, right?
4:54
You're like smile, like say hi.
Pretend like you want to be here, right?
And sometimes, use a business owner.
There.
And so sometimes your business wrongs people because the employees that you have are human and they will make mistakes and you are human, and you will make mistakes too, because all businesses are imperfect because they're based on humans who are also a perfect.
5:21
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, And so, I was like to have that perspective when doing business with anyone in general because if I am wrong or I feel like the service that I received was poor.
5:52
I think to myself, I wonder if the owner of this business had this intention for me, my guess is probably not.
So the strategy was not to be a malicious business and trying to ruin people's day.
The strategy was probably to do a good job.
It was just poorly executed.
And I think if you can approach situations that you We have this initial desire to lash out and say negative things.
6:15
And you remember that it's a human that like you're dealing with and a business is comprised of humans who feed families and have kids and have boyfriends or break up with them and have family issues and also and wake up and have bad days, right?
I think it will give you more patience and I think it will allow you to have more grace and I've tried to approach a lot of things in our business career.
6:36
And I cannot tell you the amount of times were biting my lip And not talking, smack has made me a lot of money because of deals that I was able to make with people that were one degree connected from someone.
I did not like, right now, if I had smash this person right publicly, they would tell the person that I wanted to make the deal with that.
6:58
I was a douche.
And then that would have been it.
And so, I can just say that being a dick does not make you more money.
And so it is the economical choice to have.
Grayson Business in general because those people may come back to you or you may come back to them and need something from them in the future and you burn that bridge, you cannot walk across it again.
7:22
So just something that I thought I would share for me, it's kind of funny being on the other side of it, but just for anybody, who's in those words, like when you get in that kind of negative space, just keep it to yourself.
You know what I mean?
Just like, just take it in to think.
Did this person mean to do this, right?
7:41
Was this experience that I had the intention of the owner, right?
And I think when you can do that and puts out everyone's business, now, obviously you as a business owner, you're always want to correct that because no one's going to give you Grace, right?
You're gonna expect that, everyone's going to treat you horribly and make First Impressions but still, if we can be a little bit more patient and have a little bit more perspective than the average person and we should because we're business owners for God's sake, you know, I mean, like you see waitresses.
8:08
Oh, Always tip really well to people who ever like waitress.
Like I was in, I was in shoot.
What is it Food?
Services, there's a word for it.
Like I always tip.
Oh, We're business owners.
We should tip well in business right by treating other business owners while because every other business owners of the same shit, you are, right?
8:27
Like employees deal and doing stupid stuff.
You know what I mean?
Not following instructions, like filing ridiculous claims, you know?
I mean, just all the stuff that we have to deal with, on a regular basis.
Clients being crazy, right?
We all deal with it.
And so, I guess all of this to say is that like, You have the option.
8:48
One way will make you more money and and we'll probably retain your reputation and the other way will only cast you as a person has negative things to say.
And all that people ever remember and you guys have probably heard this is no one remembers what the - person says or even who they're saying it about, but they just remember that what they are saying was - and so, then you become associated with the negativity.
9:14
So just Figured I'd share is on my mind.
I hope I hope.
I hope someone doesn't talk shit about someone else, or one of you goes into a restaurant and then leaves a review.
That's a five-star review.
That's nice or leaves.
9:30
A five-star review.
That says, hey to the owner, this was really messed up.
Please feel free like respond to me and then I'll delete this rather than leaving you a one star like, you know, probably doing something like that.
Might actually make a business owner.
Stay.
Imagine a business owner, do that to you.
You probably pretty pretty bummed about it.
9:47
So anyways, I hope I hope that's a little something.
It was on my mind, I figured I'd share it before.
I went to bed because it was just, it was brewing.
So don't burn Bridges, do the right thing and I'll catch you guys on the flip side.
Happy Tuesday, talk to you soon.









0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur, the larger, the discrepancy between the Initiation fee and then the subsequent billing things, the stickier the Billings become Welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
0:36
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Good morning.
Every one of you guys having awesome start to your day.
I'm making a badass one of the next Frameworks for the book on acquisition on how to make different offers pretty cool cuz I'm actually really, really excited.
0:59
I've got eight different ways that you can use free and monetize it.
Ethically, we've got three.
I think four different ways that you can use discount offers and still monetize the acquisition.
And so one of the ones, the ones I'm working on right now is is about discount offers.
And so, one of the things that goes hand-in-hand with this kind of offers One of the ways to use them is a one-time fee.
1:20
And so what I wanted to kind of go over is one of the pros and cons of having one time face so that can typically in most businesses not just Jim's, right?
You have one time fee which might be activation and might be initiation and might be enrollment, could be service fee.
1:36
Like you'll see it that fee appear in a lot of businesses, especially ones that are more established and that's because they understand the value of it.
So way back.
When I know that in the LA Fitness, at least, I'm not sure if they do it at 24, but I'm pretty sure they follow the same outline, which is they usually give the salesman that fee.
1:58
So, whatever the salesman's able to collect on the initiation of the enrollment fee, is actually their own commission and so because it's so inexpensive to sign someone up.
If you can't get the Initiation fee then it's like not worth your like they don't want to pay commission on a 25 dollar a month.
2:13
You know, contract and so forth.
They made the Initiation fee.
Now here's some of the benefits of the Initiation fee when you have a big Initiation fee and the larger discrepancy between the Initiation fee and then the subsequent Billings the stickier the Billings become, right?
2:30
And so for example, a friend of mine owned a chain of tanning salons and he saw that the stickiest membership that he ever created was a hundred dollars down $10 a month, so they have to pay 100 bucks but they were able to get half The monthly rate of his normal thing, which was I think it was, it was 19 something or 1888.
2:52
I think was what his monthly monthly dues were now obviously he's dealing with significant volume, you know, four thousand, plus people who have memberships at a tanning salon.
So that's you know how his his model worked.
That being said, the nice thing about the Initiation fee is one is you can use it to pay a sales person.
3:08
So that's really useful because initiation for a lot of times is typically an incredibly high margin thing, right?
You're just adding somebody into a system or whatever Or, you know processes and so that's number one.
Number two, is that it also allows you to give really cool discount offers.
3:24
So you could say 88 percent off your first month.
And so when people come in you can have the 88 percent off the first month and then you have an enrollment fee, right?
And whatever that enrollment fee is maybe in addition, like let's say you have a 200 dollar a month membership if you did 88 percent off, then you know it's 24 bucks for their first month, which is Nothing but 80% off seems really attractive, right?
3:50
But when the person comes in the door, you can still have a one time fee and you're, you know, you're compliant obviously.
You always want to be a component, Advertiser.
Put the stuff on, on your, you know.
Thank you.
Page, Etc.
This clothes, Etc.
But still, most people will be attracted to the offer to come in.
4:07
And so at that allows you to do is still essentially sign people up straight into a recurring membership at almost, you know?
So really at that point, the Percent off.
If you look at it from a numbers, standpoint would be you're making 124 instead of 200.
So you're really only giving like 30% off if you were to factor those two pieces together rather than 88, but it is obviously a lot more attractive than just saying 30 percent off your first month.
4:34
Hey guys, real quick.
For those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype, 400 leads.
But you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers, make more money.
4:52
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
Its fo free in exchange for your email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller, All Leads and so that you can not miss out on it because last time I sold out for like eight straight weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
5:11
And so there's some of the benefits of using a discount discount offer plus a one time fee and the thing is you can make that one too if you whatever you want.
And one of the ways that I justify that within a selling, you know, the context of selling is that The if you can also put an onboarding fee, but it's essentially saying you're going to cost our company more time to get you going, then you will and every subsequent month, right?
5:38
And so if we charge you a thousand dollars up front and then it was two hundred dollars a month, then it's kind of understood that like even like a fitness class is a perfect example, right?
Because in the beginning they don't know how to do anything, right?
You gotta teach him how to eat, you gotta teach him how to cook, you got to teach him how to grocery shop.
5:56
You got to teach him how to log into your you.
No, your Zen Planner your mind-body, or whatever your CRM is to get scheduled for workouts.
You gotta teach them how to actually walk through the workouts and understand kind of how your system works at your facility.
All of those are costs that you incur as business that is taking away from the servicing of other customers.
6:14
And so for me, whenever I had something that I had, you know, some sort of higher fee up front, it's always, it's very easy to explain why people that what is that it's like, well, you like the beginning, you're not going to know how to do anything.
And so it actually going to take a lot of One time with us to help you get up to speed, once you're up to speed, you cost us significantly less to continue to maintain.
6:36
And so at that point, you get to that's reflected in the fact that you're saving 80% on an ongoing basis.
So that's that's how that way you can position it as.
Like, if I had to keep doing this, you have to keep paying this thousand dollars a month.
But instead, once we put this initial time into you, then at that point the the savings that we have our path straight on to you.
6:56
And so it's a different way of explaining.
Meaning it that I think most people a get and B are not nearly as, you know, weirded out about.
But make most my mistake if you've ever gone to any kind of, especially bigger businesses that you've heard of, I like using car rental companies, because they're very big companies that most people have interacted with like, those fees are 100% pure margin and it's so that they can recoup the cost of acquisition and pay commissions to the person who sold you.
7:27
All right, So anywho that is just a little, a little, a little note on one way to use discounted offers I have four other ones that I have eight different ways that you can monetize free.
So very excited to release that.
It's going to be the new e-book infographics on Frameworks for acquisition.
7:45
So I'm pretty pumped about it.
But anyways hope that has value before you if it is you know drop a comment or a like and if it wasn't then just don't talk, alright?
Anyways, have an amazing day.
Could you guys soon?
Bye.









0:00
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, a lot of what has been created for the community is good.
0:20
I think it's all great stuff but we need to solve the fucking problem.
Welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer.
And the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
It was when everyone hope you guys are having well, I would say a great Monday, but I'm sure right now you're in the middle of the thick of it.
0:44
And so I wanted to give you guys a couple updates of what's going on our side and then also give you a couple Frameworks to kind of think through what's going on right now with.
So first off on the gym launch side, we are actively testing the ads in for remote Jim's.
1:03
We'd already you may or may not remember we had our hyper program that we launched.
Letsa.
Go to the to the great when you call it lash back of the entire gym Community saying that I was trying to kill gyms and in fact, it is probably the thing that they wish they had started a month ago and I say that only to say sometimes having an open mind is a good idea.
1:23
That being said we're testing ads in 35 markets.
As of right now I want to give them 72 hours to run.
There's three main points of success that we're looking for which is one that the lead flow is what we We expected to be, which is the same as the 21-day play, right now, that's killing it, or was killing it, you know, into Corona to that Beyond system that we have set up for booking remote calls works.
1:48
As as intended, it as desired my gut is that it's actually going to work a little bit better.
Since we don't actually have to get someone in the car short for their appointment.
And the third is that the offer that we've structured on the phone converts at the percentage that we said it was going to.
So those are the three things that we're testing.
2:05
We have 35 markets that were running it in And I'll let you guys know in real time when we have the results from that and then that will be what released because my intention was not to create a checklist or widget or PDF and I think that a lot of what has been created for the community is good.
I think it's all great stuff, but we need to solve the fucking problem.
2:24
And so that's kind of what I want to talk about for the second small piece of this, which is kind of looking ahead.
So I want to make a promise to you which is that what you're going to go through over the next?
Next few months is going to be some of the hardest that you're going to go through.
2:41
I'm promising, you know, Sunshine no rainbows.
It's going to be intense and you're going to have to work and I know that some of you were in a headspace going into this, that was like I was already fucking burned out, I was already tired.
And it was before all this shit happened, right?
And so you're going to have to dig deep and find a gear inside of you of how bad you want to do this.
3:00
Because right now looking ahead, there's probably a voice in your head that's telling you if we fail right now.
Like no one's going to blame us like, you know, my wife's not going to thing with failure, my parents will be like, well, you know, coronavirus, right?
And the thing is, is that they would be 100% reasonable and saying that because it wouldn't be your fault right.
3:19
It would be incredibly reasonable for a gym to go under during this transition time, right?
But what I'm asking to do is not be reasonable but be unreasonable.
All right?
And want more and there's going like everything that affects Jim's effects.
Jim Lunch.
All right?
3:34
So like I'm going through this shoulder to shoulder.
ER, with you trying to figure this out, you've got payroll.
I've got 600,000 over the payroll.
All right?
So the feelings, you have just multiply them, all right?
I get where you're coming from, but I can tell you, that Winners will always win whenever there's Panic.
There's always opportunity, Panic is simply an embodiment of intense pain, whenever there's pain, it means there's something that can be solved, and that means right now, here's the, here's the Silver Lining there going to be more people on their phones.
4:01
Hold up at home health, conscious worried about their health, eating cookies, all these feelings, Fat, right?
Who are like I said, on their phones and The Impressions on Facebook are already. 50% off.
If anybody who still marketing right now knows, Lee cost of actually dropped.
4:19
That's because a lot of people have stopped their advertising and so it is going to be just like, whatever happens at every kind of v-bottom.
And every Market is there's going to be a winner-take-all, there's going to be a consolidation, the guys who don't have the willpower or gals to whether this will give up all of their members to other gyms.
4:37
And the gyms who make it through, will be bigger stronger, and more profitable than ever.
And that's a promise that will happen.
Buying behavior is going to shift because as every single gym now has had circumstances break their belief about whether remote training was possible in a brick and mortar facility in a local market, all right.
5:00
It is going to be possible and that belief is being made for you.
That choice has now been made you have the choice eight months ago to make that choice for yourself now it's being made for you.
All right?
And so with that choice now consumers are going to be used to giving their card over the phone and having remote services.
5:17
And so because of this, like I said, Silver Lining a People are going to get used to remote training.
It's going to become more mainstream.
I think this may have actually moved up the remote training, kind of movement, maybe, 18, 24 months, from what it was going to be.
I think there's going to be a lot of gyms Who come out on the other side of this with a booming remote business because like I said demand for this is going to be huge.
5:38
Your skill set has never been more valuable and yet undervalued and so my goal is to flip the script during this period of time and let Jim's capitalize on that, right?
And so The play is going to be simple.
We're going to one.
5:53
Stop the bleeding.
You need to transition all of your existing clients into remote.
You may think?
Well, we're not quarantined yet.
It's a matter of time.
You have to look at this.
Everybody's watching the same movie.
It just matters, what chapter?
All right?
So look at the people who are cover chapters of head and just read forward.
6:10
Don't think.
Well, we're not there yet because honestly, I think it's going to get there, right?
And so whether you are quarantine by mandatory or people have already started the social distancing, you've already probably seen this.
And so just start preparing ahead.
All right.
Now, what is the offer that you're going to do to stop the bleeding?
6:27
You're going to have to offer one-on-one services for remote training so that you can keep the value of not coming to the gym.
And so if you're used to charging a hundred fifty dollars a month or two hundred dollars a month, for in-person training, you have to, you have to over deliver on value to your clients because they're no longer getting what they signed up for.
6:46
And so you have to give more of the thing that they didn't sign up for in order to keep them and So it's not I was working out and now I'm not working out.
You have to frame it as you used to be in a group setting and now your one-on-one.
All right?
And that's the value here is that you're going to shift them from a 101 in person, setting.
7:03
Sorry a group setting.
That's that's not that's in person a group setting and person to a 10-1 remote setting and by doing that you'll be able to maintain the value discrepancy of a 200 dollar month membership.
All right, now for right now you're like oh shit, I likes I don't have that.
7:18
I'm not ready for that.
This is where I said this Is going to take work, you're probably going to work more in the next.
I don't know how many months I wish I could tell you right forever.
This how long this takes, right?
You're going to work more during this period of time than you probably ever have the good news is that you're not going to be at your Dem.
7:37
So you're going to be working from home.
And so, for anyone who's ever had to do with this.
If you don't have all these sessions to take care of it actually does calm, the noise a little bit.
And so the majority of your day is going to be doing sales calls, all right?
Your trainers, need to fill on those remotes.
Services so that they can continue to get paid.
7:53
There are going to be people who get laid off period as much as I'd love to say that.
Like, you need to keep everyone.
You need to make business decisions.
You need to look at who your most valuable assets.
Who is willing to work, more, who's willing to buckle down, who is not emotional, who can be calm, and who can continue to provide value while things get a little bit crazy.
8:10
Okay, now, my hope is that everything blows over and none of this matters, but I don't think that's going to happen on a shirt of time friend.
And so we just need to prepare a Mo's an Asian Quick break just to let you know we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright.
So send me a connection request and note.
8:27
Let me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
Alright, so number one, you stop the bleeding.
8:42
Number two, you have to focus on how you can cut overhead.
All right.
Now you have a facility, there are a couple things that you can do.
The primary one is that you can email your landlord and ask for rent relief.
Okay, and so, what that means is, you should be able to get two to six months of free.
9:00
Rent, free room and board.
There are a couple ways to structure those deals and I'm going to tell you these right now so that you can tactically do something.
All right, the training that we're going to come out with later this week is going to have all these an email I'm plates and all that stuff.
But for right now I just feel like I'm just going to give you the overlay one.
9:15
You could just ask for the free, run up front, all right?
And the reason that you have leverage, there is because most most leases have Clauses that are active God or false measure of Clauses, which means force majeure, you're saying it differently, right?
Closets means that there's something crazy that happens.
9:31
You can get out of the lease.
Now coronavirus is something that would cause injunctive relief to your, you know, huge damage to your business and could, you can make it very easy argument that that's what B.
Now a landlord is probably not going to be able to find another tenant for the rest for six months, and they would like to keep you.
And so you have to understand where you have leverage, all right, they're not going to find someone else.
9:50
And so giving you three months, four months of free rent, so that they can keep you.
As a tenant is something that a lot of them will be willing to do number one.
Number two.
How do you structure that one?
Is they can just give it to you and they can subtract it from the lease.
Number two is, they can literally just push the lease forward.
10:05
So you basically add another, you know, three to six months to your lease.
At the end, we're going to be Paying for that.
So your total least value stays the same, you're just pushing out some free months during this Gap here.
All right, that's one way of structuring the deal, the other way obstruction, the deal.
I mean, there's many another way is taking that amount and depending on how much time you have left in your lease.
10:24
If you have like three or four years left, you can take that time and amortize it which just means spreading it across the rest of the duration.
So, if you want to take, like, let's say, let's say your rent was two thousand dollars a month and you're getting three months free, that'd be six thousand dollars.
You take six thousand dollars in divided over per 48 months, if you got like four years left, all right.
10:43
And so it would be a significant amount cheaper.
It might be a couple hundred bucks a month more after.
This is through.
All right.
So that's that's what amortizing over over.
The least looks like.
And the other thing you can do, is combine it, right?
Be like, listen, I need, I need six months.
All right.
10:58
I'll tack three months on the end and give me three months amortized, right?
And so, you can combine these things, so that you can get more free rent, okay?
Because you need that right now, because you're not using the facility and you're not allowed to Right?
And you can make that argument to any landlord, and if they're in any way reasonable, they're going to, they're going to work with you, alright?
11:16
So step one, stop the bleeding transition, people to remote training as fast as humanly possible create the training system that you have.
No, we already have that in hybrid.
We already released that in remote for our guys, and on later this week, we're going to release it to everyone else that we can help the industry out.
All right, the second thing is that you can cut your overhead which with the least thing that I just said you can also look at SBA relief loans.
11:40
It's going to be like three and a half percent of people are going to get it, but that's the one in 33.
You should still take the shot.
All right, 50 billion.
They're going to be putting in pumping into the economy and most people qualify for like five grand to 2.5 million so you can go for apply for that.
All right, the third piece which is the exciting piece, is you need to fill the bucket back up.
11:56
All right?
So that's we're going to run advertisements.
Yes, you're going to run advertisements.
Why?
Because impressions are cheaper than ever right now and people are all on the phones so that means that there's more attention, there's more ad space than ever before and it's cheap.
More than ever before.
So the people who capitalize on this are going to make a lot of money.
12:14
All right, so you have to remember that so with every every Panic, there's always opportunity.
So I don't want you to lose your minds over this, you're going to lose some cancellations, okay?
Prepare yourself emotionally, it's going to happen.
All right?
But you're going to have a way to get it back.
All right?
12:30
You're going to have a way to get it back and that's everything that we're focused on it.
Jim watch this.
Like I said, we need a complete solution.
I can't just give you a partial Lucian and say, Transition everyone pray to God and hope for the best.
It's not going to work, right?
And that's all we're doing a gym launched since the first announcement last week for seven days, our entire development team is working around the clock like truly Around the Clock.
12:50
They're taking shifts to get Alan so that it could generate remote appointments for people so that you can spend less time doing anything but selling and fulfilling, right?
So if your team can do the Fulfillment, you can do the selling and then the marketing can do the marketing and that That way you can still continue to cash, flow your business.
13:10
All right?
And hopefully you might end up on the other side of this thing, with a very large remote business and then you'll have decisions to make about what you want to do.
Because if you have 20,000 30,000 recurring remote customers, you might just want to stay out something to consider all right.
13:27
But this is going to fundamentally shift the way consumers by it's going to bring online training and remote training far more to the Forefront giving cards over the phone and getting remote training for a few hundred dollars a month.
It could be fun.
More commonplace.
And a lot of people may end up liking it, they might like the one-on-one attention, that's why it isn't industry already.
13:43
Alright, so all that to say, keep your heads about you and the one thing I can leave you with from a mindset standpoint is You're going to tell a story about what you do right now.
The next few months are going to be telling and they're going to tell the story of who you are and who you choose to be.
14:02
And so I would think deeply about who that person that you want to be is because this is where like this is where this is where diamonds get made and these are the moments that you will be able to look back on and be like I made it through that shit.
I can fucking handle this right?
14:19
And like you we'll have every rational reason to give up.
The reason the Navy Seals training is so hard, it's not because one day of its heart it's because they have to do it every single day and it's voluntary.
You can leave at any time and that's how businesses and right now it's about to get hard and the people who don't have the willpower are not going to make it just telling you.
14:42
But the people who do will have a story that they will be able to tell themselves, that will create the identity of the person they want to be and reinforce that because that story of who you really are, we'll stick with you far beyond this moment.
All right.
So this is an opportunity for you to prove to yourself about who you are.
15:01
All right?
It's going to be a lot of work.
It always is, but there's going to be a lot of opportunity for the people who keep their eyes open, okay?
So keep your eyes open.
Do is like work as hard as you can to keep the people.
You got, we're working as hard as we can on the back end to get this acquisition system, so that you can fill fill your gym up right through the remote training.
15:21
Which by the way, is much higher higher profit model to begin with.
Because if you had 200 customers at $20, a month or more training, and you don't have sessions, you have to pay for.
And you don't have rent, that's a better model, which was the whole argument for hybrid eight months ago.
That's okay.
Now, everyone's ready?
15:36
So, anyways, I just will say, all of you all are going to do everything in our power, like truly everything in our power.
I believe that we're going to do it, we're going to accomplish the objective because we have the skill set, we have the resources.
And we have the motivation and so there's no reason for me to think in any way that we can't do it.
15:55
So we will already have, I would say if we're going to give an estimate we're probably about 80% of the way there.
We're just putting the finishing touches on and we should have a live later this week.
So anyways guys, love you all hang in there.
You can fucking do this.
All right I'll see you guys in their side.
And we have the motivation and so there's no reason for me to think in any way that we can't do it.
So we will already have, I would say if we're going to give an estimate we're probably about 80% of the way there.
We're just putting the finishing touches on and we should have a live later this week.
So anyways guys, love you all hang in there.
You can fucking do this.
All right I'll see you guys in their side.









0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
Good morning and welcome to the gym.
See.
It's podcast, I'm your host, my name is Alex and I will be showing you the Beautiful World, some phone sell stuff.
So one of the things that a lot of people do when they are selling is they are calling leads, right?
0:44
So they're making calls, there are two very tactical things in beginning.
Today, that will help you tremendously.
The first one is you should get a dialer to get an automated dollar.
That will increase the amount of calls that you were able to make.
You can increase the amount of calls that you make per hour and increases the amount.
1:00
Appointments per hour that you make ultimately means that you make less you make more money per hour, spent on the phone, which I'm off for efficiency.
So there's your first tactic that you can go to the second one.
Is.
The moment that someone answers the phone you about three seconds, I probably lost the man.
1:20
That was my student.
I'm it's basically you have a moment you have to make an impression and here's a very cool little hack that we figured out and what it is is most people will say, hey the going to the phone, say hello and they're like hi is this John?
And then they're like click or they're like yeah who's this right?
1:44
And When you say that it automatically puts you in the super super subservient position that I don't really like, I don't think you would like that either.
And so we figured out and I don't know if this team to me intuitively or whatever is that if you try and model native interactions organic interactions between human beings, right?
2:03
Then you look at how people post one another, how people post on Facebook organically and if you want to model it, so people actually give it the full attention.
I'm going on an offshoot here but hopefully you follow with me down this rabbit hole.
Um, you want your post to look as organic as possible?
Write to me that most people will give you the most attention.
2:20
You want to make it not look organic as possible, make your make your make your ads and image with some, you know, with some, you know, like a, I don't even know, just make it a really boring image with a big fat button on it, and yeah, do that.
2:40
And a lot of times that that really wasn't very specific.
Anyways just don't It looks like an ad.
That's my point.
All right.
Back to the main point, which is, how do you answer the phone.
So if you're going to model human organic reaction, what you would say, if I were to call someone as some of the, if someone picks up and says, hey, I would then say, what's up John?
3:00
I don't ask my friends with their name is I just call them either him like, what's up John?
What's up, Dave?
How's it going, right?
That's what I would say.
And what happens is the totally different action on the other side.
They're like, who's this, right?
It's different because they're not racing through their mind.
3:17
Like, how does this person?
Know my name?
Not.
Oh, this must be a telemarketer trying to tell me something totally different.
All right?
And so you're like, hey Dave, like hey like it's Alex then pause and I like, who the freak is Alex?
You're like from one to three Fitness.
3:33
You just signed up for my for my program on line, two seconds ago.
How's it going?
And they're like, oh my gosh, man, you are fast.
And you're like, yes I am.
That's what she said.
No, I'm just kidding.
I'm just kidding, right.
You're building Rapport instantly within the first 10 seconds on.
Ready but more report the most people do right?
And he's like, oh yeah how's it going like cool man why'd you sign up and you're already boom right into the sale.
3:53
Already confronting a man you know I just thought it looked interesting.
You're like us you just like opted into things I look interested and you're in, you're in perfect shape where you got something to work on and they're like, oh well you know, I need to lose some weight and like boom.
So you got out of the way you got the?
Yeah.
Yeah.
The don't say it's an objection.
4:09
But basically people throw things out there to distract you, they don't want to acknowledge the fact that Even need, you need to smash those and be like, oh, you just like opted-in things because it because it's fun in here in perfect a party.
And they're like, no, no, I'm not in perfect shape it like, okay, you're trying to lose weight?
No, I yeah, I guard.
4:24
Cool.
Seen you lose weight?
That's why I signed up like.
Yeah, right.
You get him to acknowledge that needing to sign it to him.
All right, now I'm not good for wholesale sequence, but hopefully, just from those two things, it will increase the amount of sales that you get from your leads.
So use the dialer, it'll increase the amount of calls that are able to make their, by making more appointments, and thereby, a Getting more people to walk in your door from an existing list and the second thing is watch the first 10 seconds of how you talk to someone.
4:53
And if you say it this way and try to model organic communication, you'll have a far better chance of getting into a not hang up on you and be get them to buy your stuff.
All right, have an awesome day guys.
And if you are someone who is interested in finding out how we get Jim's from zero to full capacity in 30 days, we'd love to show you our process.
5:12

5:27

And I'll catch you guys on the flip side.









0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually a pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect, and let's rock and roll your competitors.
0:17
Don't steal clients from me, right?
No one steals clients you lose clients.
Welcome to the gym.
Secrets podcast.
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer, and how to keep them longer and the many failures.
And And lessons that we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
0:35
Well, it's going everyone happy Saturday morning or whenever it is that you are listening to this.
I wanted to this just came to mind and it's I've had a bunch of recent experiences that have kind of really made me think about how I approach or think about competitors.
0:53
Quote stealing clients and kind of the reverse of that.
What I'm calling like tactical abundance.
So over the last, I don't know how many years I've had people.
You know, our direct space who served your Motors Etc, reach out because they wanted help, you know, with their businesses and I believe it or not help them out with their businesses.
1:18
Even though they directly, quote compete with my business and I kind of wanted to give you a little bit of break down around that.
Now, if someone is publicly, you know, just an asshole about me that I'm probably not going to have them.
But for anyone else, I'm I Up them with their business.
1:36
And I think that it has been one of the things that has kept me sane throughout this process and I think you've if you've been in this space for a while, any kind of the information marketing Etc space people come they assume up for you know and then they poof they're gone right?
1:53
And you know I think we've stood the test of time and we've been a very big person in this category.
The biggest that I'm aware of for a very long period of time at this point.
And so I just wanted to To break down some of the thoughts around it, and I think that they will serve you from a mental health standpoint in thinking about your competitors.
2:11
So, first is some of the beliefs that I have around this.
First, your you don't your competitors.
Don't steal clients from you, right?
No one steals clients you lose clients, right?
Just like, in my opinion, no one steals, your wife, you lose your wife, your wife becomes open, or your spouse.
2:30
Whatever becomes open to the possibility of entertaining.
Someone else.
Right, they become open to the possibility during some instance or instances that amount during your relationship with them.
There have probably been times in your relationship with your spouse.
2:45
Where if someone came onto you, you were just like, I have, like, no, I'm not open for business, like, nothing wrong with you.
I'm sure you're a great person.
I just like, I'm, I'm in like, I'm not on the market or not for sale, right?
And I think that, if you, if you, if you think about your customer relations, I think all relationships are like this in that same.
3:05
Context.
It allows you one to have a lot more power in your own business.
And to to just stop all of the, the the Mindless needless worrying, that that comes with managing lots of relationships because that's ultimately what we're doing is, we're building relationships scale.
3:22
When you have a service-based business, you're having a relationship with your customers at scale and trying to replicate yourself and your beliefs and how you act, how you honor your customers with staff, who are less incentive eyes than you are right.
Everyone is Is intrinsically less incentivized than you are to help your customers.
3:39
Right?
And so I I think it's one of the most freeing things in the entire world to help someone who in most people's minds, would be a direct competitor.
And I can tell you that the more times I have done this one, the the amount of awe and shock that you get from the person who you are helping of like, are you helping me?
4:04
Like I don't I don't It it fundamentally shifts how they view the world when you help them when you don't have a quote vested interest in them succeeding right now.
Anyways, you have a you have a core like you have a you have a direct or what most people would consider an inverse.
4:25
We call it incentive, to help them.
Write your be incentivized to not help them and have them go down.
But it just hasn't been my experience because What happens is one more and more people are like, you know what, that guy's legit, you know, like he really actually wants to help and if you do genuinely believe in your mission of helping your client, if you really want to help, I mean, because I hear it all the time to merge, like I want to help a million people lose weight.
4:53
Like, do you think realistically in the next year and helping people lose weight?
Do you think in five years, helping people lose weight?
Probably not.
So if you help somebody else who's probably has a pretty similar mission to you, do you think Net positive.
It's going to be a good or a bad thing.
You're probably just gonna have more people and you'll build a relationship with someone else who also actually struggles with believe it or not the same things you do.
5:15
Right?
And if, and what happens is you start create these reciprocal relationships were both of you get better, right?
And all it does is just Elevate the bar and the people who want to have a more scarcity, mindset continue to isolate themselves onto their islands and the communal, whole, always grows better than an individual period, right?
5:32
The jeweler's Community is far more valuable then An eye on my own could ever create anything right?
It's just because as a community, we can test it, such a faster rate and we can innovate it.
Such a faster rate than if you're not in that Community.
You're at it, you're at a fundamental disadvantage and so it works with any type of business, right?
5:49
Like it's not just, you know, the info business or not just the gymnast but any business and I'm just saying like right now I'm actually prioritizing says may seem crazy everyone but I'm actually prioritizing helping a lot of other people who are in the gym space.
You serve gyms Because I just because, you know, we've we've, we've made, we've made more than more than multiple lifetimes worth of wealth.
6:14
And I just can tell you that the more abundant my thought process is around this, the more money I make and as and also just like the better, I feel like I can I can look in the mirror and be like, I really do believe in this mission of saying that we're trying to help police you know, small business owners just do better because it's hard to say that and then at the same Time when you have a direct way of helping another group of business owners that you're not going to help.
6:40
And, you know, one of the things is, like, understanding, how big the like freakin pie is like the pie is huge.
You know, when I hear even, I mean, even in this group, you know, the in this, in this free group, like people say, what if there's other other gyms using Jim launched in my neighborhood?
6:57
Well, one you're not one of them then you're at a fundamental disadvantage number.
One, number two, there's also like five, A hundred other gyms that aren't using it.
So would you rather be one of the six that is?
Or would you rather not, you know what I mean?
And what ends up happening is that the six that are just end up keeping more customers and serving them better and ultimately making a more profound impact.
7:18
And so in thinking about that, I guess.
I'm trying to get like, like, tactical abundances like you only lose customers.
No one steals them from you.
Stop thinking that anyone steals your customers like no business has had any impact on the growth of Jim launch whatsoever.
7:39
New Guy starts up, steals steel, word-for-word copies, and pastes everything that we have a gym lunch, are they as big as your much?
No, because they don't have the skills to build that, right?
Because if that's the, if that's the Mind space, that you're operating out of Never going to be right.
I'm gonna be us from that, right?
7:56
And so like it's like the only way to win is to just kind of realize that it's not about you and that there's a much bigger game, afoot, right?
There's a much bigger game.
And like, I even have this conversation because I've just recently had this conversation with probably 10 different people who are Jim agencies, Jim gurus, things like that.
8:13
And, and like, I had on almost all of them the same moment where they're like, I can't believe you're helping me.
And I'm like, dude, I don't like there's there's enough.
If there's enough Jim's, there's enough gyms that need help that we can all pitch in, right?
The market is huge.
8:29
It's so much bigger than you think it is and me as probably the biggest player in the space.
I'm telling you.
We are we are a tiny droplet in the ocean of help that is needed.
The supply of help that I can provide is still so limited.
Compared to the demand that exists for gym owners or any business owner that needs help, right?
8:50
And it's it would be egotistical of me to say every Person is going to be attracted to my style, my Candor, my message and kind of who I am, right?
Like I am somewhat polarizing and partially by Design, from a marketing standpoint because I want to attract people who are willing to grind her ruin to hustle ruin it, roll their sleeves up, you know, like I'm taking sales calls for something right now that makes zero Financial sense for me to do but I'm doing it because that's that's what I believe, right?
9:18
I tell everyone in our community.
You should sell it first, you should get on the phone.
First, you Good work, chap, you should work intercom.
This is a my company, right?
I know that, because I do it, right?
And then that way, I have absolute conviction and understanding the problems that each of the positions that are in my company, have any executive that wants to start at Zappos, which is a billion dollar, plus, you know, shoe company, that Amazon owns, they have to start by working Frontline, customer service for two weeks, super highly paid Executives, you know million-dollar-plus, multi-million dollar plus executive stock options, bonuses, and all that stuff.
9:53
Starting at a Frontline job so that they can understand how it really works and so they can make decisions based on reality.
Not their theoretical share mindset.
And so I guess, I guess I say that to say I try and have that messaging because that's what, that's what we want to attract, but there are people who are not attracted to that, like do the boring work, do the repetition grower, die speed is King, you know?
10:21
I mean, violence is the answer, like that's how How I roll because that's what I believe works.
Best in the people who Vibe with that stay in our community and continue to succeed, right?
And there are people who have come into our world and been like, I'm not about that, right?
I want to, I want to, I want to, I want to, I want to have balance.
10:39
I want to, I want to have this be more of a lifestyle thing.
That's amazing.
That is just not how I do business, right?
Not to say that, you can't not to say that you can't use the systems and people, you know, we talked about that in the says, I got to see you can't like instead of making an extra two hundred thousand here, maybe you make an extra 18, you're cool with that and that's a trade-off that you understand, you're making Most Nation real quick.
11:05
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to fifteen hundred dollars.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
11:24
Right.
And so the thing is that there are other people.
There are other agencies, there are other Jim gurus, there are other whatever's, right?
And I'm using the word guru Loosely as much as what's so funny.
Is that there's there's some of you were like I've anti Guru.
I'm like if you sell information on how to improve business, you would be categorized as a guru so you can lament the name.
11:43
But as to be fair, when I got into the business, I think one of my, my first ads is Stop Believing gurus.
And there's like, one of my first ads and I just want this huge ran and actually do really well for a long time.
The thing is just like, at the time I was really Like, I just had this this like, you know, I like let me go, let me go beat the beat the world kind of mentality and I think it's really Shifting the metallic from beating everyone to say they are going and believing I'm know if I can save you, I've rather not at all.
12:09
But in terms of your mind space of like am I really trying to help or my trying to win and I think that as we as as time is going on and I feel like my head space has improved.
Its really like how can I help him and the reality is that I can And so if I can help other people that can help people, that I'm still helping those people indirectly and that's good enough for me.
12:31
Because like I said, there are people who are not attracted to me, there are people who are attracted to a female Avatar, right?
Somebody who's a female Guru, because that's more what they vied with there.
Are people who are more like, hey I travel all the time and this is my this this is this is who I'm attracted to him like cool, be attracted to them.
12:50
That's fine.
You know?
I mean like you're going to attract and repel and you Can't go vanilla in the middle because then you're just not being true to who you are.
And so I think is like, bu you'll attract the people who are right for you from a psychographic standpoint, not just demographics.
It's not like, who's your client woman, who are trying to lose weight.
13:07
If you really look at your best clients, they have psychological beliefs, they have values that are probably aligned with yours, and that is why they truly stay right.
And so big picture, if you want to, if you help a competitor out, you're not even really detracting from your This because they probably have a somewhat different belief set value set, then you do, and that's okay.
13:33
But to help them get better results for their clients or help them retain their clients.
Better like the only thing that all of us are competing against is the couch is doing nothing.
Like the biggest winner in the marketplace in any Market, B2B b2c.
Whatever is apathy is doing nothing and if you can shift your mindset of towards like, all of us are together all gym owners are Are united in the fact that we're trying to beat the couch, we're trying to beat doing nothing.
13:58
We're trying to be staying at home and not showing up your appointment.
We're trying to beat you saying know that you can't commit to something right now.
We're all trying to beat that together, right?
If you can shift your perspective from that, I guarantee you that you will have so much better head, space, and life, and just energy that it's been.
14:14
It's been a really profound change for me.
And now that I've actually been leaning into this in, it's been really rewarding for me and believe it or not.
I make the same amount of money as I did before, right?
But I feel a lot better, right?
And so if you have these kind of, you know, animosity relationships like I don't know if I'm going to show that.
14:40
I won't.
But let's, let's say that you had a trainer, right at your gym and they say, you know what, I'm out, right?
And, and they leave and they take customers from you.
Write your first gut reaction is to Pace is to be like screw that guy hate that he took my client right now.
14:58
Mind you you lost him or her to the same degree that you lose a client, right?
Or that person grows and eventually gets to the point where there are like this isn't, you know, I've evolved I've grown, I've And all the things that you've taught me.
And I think that I'm ready for the next chapter, if you can have, if you can have the conversation and say, I want to help you start a gym to your trainer.
15:21
I want to help you.
I guarantee you that the entire Dynamic of your world will change.
The thoughts that consume you because, believe it or not, when that trainer leaves, right?
And they have a negative experience and then he starts smashing, you, it's talking shit and all this stuff right versus you being like, dude, you're opening Do let me help you with all things that I struggled with early on, so you don't have to go through that.
15:45
The whole dynamic will change a be, by the way, all the shit talking that they're going to do against you is going to go.
I'm just saying, I mean, unless they're an absolute psychopath and you really know, my trainer was a sec about.
Well, you hired him and they worked for you for a while.
So maybe maybe not, maybe it's just situation, who knows?
16:00
But let's just pretend that they're a normal person.
They just have incentives there.
Always self-interested and you being a smart business owner want to align yourself with people selfish incentives because believe it or not, people will always act in their own self-interest and if you do that and you always aligned with that, then you will You will be so much better served in your life and so you have this conversation with this trainer and say cool.
16:19
How can I help you win, right?
How can I help do yummy?
People are overweight here.
Like we should work together.
You know, I mean there's so many people are overweight need help.
Like if both of us are working to try and grow and improve, then we're both going to prove it a faster rate because I can use some things you make you, some of the things I make and we're going to grow together.
16:35
Right?
First is having this this really scarcity mindset.
You getting in, you know, either a having To talk to you.
And then you should talk back which I strongly strongly advise against like the best road is to just not not engaged that has been my experience.
16:52
This whole time is just don't engage because all people are going to see is you looking Petty?
That's it.
And all they're going to sit there.
I remember what that conversation about.
There's gonna remember that you were Petty.
And then the second is that, if you, if you do that, if you, if you decide not to do anything.
17:07
So it's one is you are Petty and respond.
Terrible decision.
Option two is you don't respond at all option.
Three is you rise.
Truly above and you help the person even though most people would think that they wronged you and I think that it has been one of the it's literally been one of the most rewarding things for me in terms of character growth that I've ever done.
17:26
And I just wanted to share that with you because it's been, it's been, it's been really transformative, it really has been.
It's been, it's not even dare say it's been healing to help people that you would once think for people who are against you.
And so that's that's my, that's my tactical abundance for Is one a never talk shit?
17:48
Be apathy if you can't help then don't try and flush out.
But if you can get into the space where you can help people, right?
Who are who are in your mind quote stealing your customers, a they're not you're losing them but you can actually work together and then accomplish the supposed mission that you said you have because we are so small compared to the need your ability to supply help.
18:14
You to the world of helping people lose weight, given your capacity in terms of your employees and your square footage.
And your everything is so limited.
Compared to the demand that all we should be working on is how can we do it better so that we don't lose people, right?
So that we can all collectively work against the couch, so we can collectively work against apathy and I think that if you can reframe that, it will really fundamentally change your life.
18:40
And so that's just, it's been on my mind, I've had Ten.
Maybe fifteen conversation with Jim agencies and cruise over the last month or so with people getting involved with Alan and whatnot that we're going to be rolling out and I'm like I just want to help you.
18:58
I'm going to help you grow your business.
I'm going to show you how we mark it.
I'm going to show you how how we retain customers which I hope we serve people better.
I'm going to show you how we can help your gyms increase, their average client value and they're like why are you doing this?
This is like is like it's just there.
So I just rather everyone win.
19:14
I really would, I genuinely would and it's been what?
It's honestly, been some of the most healing stuff that I've ever gone through.
So that's my that's my two cents for everyone.
I hope I hope it was someone died before you.
Hopefully there's maybe there's someone in your heart that you harbored regret or anger or poison against the thing is is like it only hurts you and I think that's been one of the biggest Revelations.
19:35
It's like you just being angry, only hurt you, it doesn't hurt anybody else.
And so, I think this is probably one of the most healing things that I've done and I'd strongly recommend.
End it.
So anyways, how amazing you guys, hope you have a great Saturday, hope you're crushing sales, taking names, taking credit cards and saving lives or at least helping, alright, be easy.
19:54
But









0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
This is an opportunity where you Actually get to have your customers, encourage you, to go to remote training where you have lower overhead and higher margin, welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
0:45
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on, everyone?
I wanted to give you all an update /.
I just did a one-hour call with our Jewish community and there was a bunch of good questions that came up.
And so I wanted to give a Consolidated version of my answers so that I could hopefully have some you guys out.
1:03
So, one of the questions that came on is, what do you say when someone says on the phone?
Hey, you know what, I can't spend money right now because things are unclear or I'm not sure because I'm unemployed etcetera, right?
So, the only real comeback, That that I have right now.
1:20
For that is you look at the person, you're like, listen, there's a lot of things that we can't control right now, but the few things that we can, like that's what we should try.
And that's what we should try and control our life, right?
There's a million variables out there but there's only a few that we can't control.
So we should at least exert our control over those.
Those being your health, right?
1:36
And so that's the only overcome I can.
I can really provide for.
Like I don't have a job.
I don't know what my future is going to look like etcetera.
Is like, there's a lot of uncertainty, but there's only a few things.
We can't control and we should at least control those, right?
And that gives you an overcome for that that that that sale obstacle.
1:53
That being said, you're going to have people say no and you got to just develop thick skin, because right now is actually going to pre high-volume game.
I haven't seen volume like this in terms of lead flow and years and so on, which is a good thing, big pictures like there's tons of lead flow that's happening right now.
2:12
And so you just have to understand, it's going to be a volume game, right?
It's going to be a volume game and I think he'll said it was, like, money's money.
Right.
And you can't be picky about how it comes and you just got to be able to roll with it.
The reason I titled this, there's always a ways because it really depends on how you approach this like Layla.
2:29
And I were getting on the phone, with some other business owners, they had like 30 locations for physical therapy, and they just shut up.
So they just shut down all of their locations, and laid off 100% of their staff, right?
And they were having a pretty bad day, right?
And the reason I brought that up is because we have to be grateful in the fitness world that we actually have A way to provide value to our customers.
2:51
That's really not that dissimilar than what we have.
Sure, we can be super butter.
Like man, I wish I was old toilet paper, man.
I wish I sold food, man.
I wish that's all.
You know, whatever, right.
There's a huge shift in demand.
Curve that happened.
Overnight the cards of the economy, got reshuffled and readout right overnight.
3:07
And so there's a huge shift that happened.
Some some Industries had massive supply and demand disappear, overnight movie theaters, right 0?
Right.
If you're in a vent, Later zero.
Right where you serve event planners, nothing, you serve restaurants, nothing?
3:25
Right?
Like we have to think big picture.
Are we even that affected?
Not really, and here's a fun one for you.
Eight months ago, we talked about having a hydrogen and some guys took action on that and boy, they are grateful that they did, but the point of me bringing this up, is this eight months ago?
3:41
We had a bunch of gyms that just flipped a hybrid and they had to deal with a bunch of backlash and things like that with their within the community.
They're like we're going to be doing remote.
Emmett and the reason they did it was because the margins are so much better, right?
This is an opportunity where you actually get to have your customers, encourage you, to go to remote training where you have lower overhead and higher margin.
4:01
If you go from thirty thousand dollars a month of top-line to twelve thousand dollars a month of top line.
But you eliminate your rent and the vast majority of your payroll.
Guess what?
You make more money.
All right, so you got it.
You got to be thinking about this in big picture, like perspective wise, like we're actually, we're dealt a pretty Decent hand in the fitness industry.
4:20
So like you gotta, you know, like flip your thinking and so when I said, there's always a way there's always a way like I was a little disappointed to hear the physical therapist said that they just shut down all their locations, I mean by their locations, I was my whole thing.
I probably wouldn't have done that, I'd be like, boom.
All right, we're switching everyone to remote calls.
4:35
We're going to send everyone bands and balls and we're going to walk them through their physical therapy session while they're with us.
All right?
So we're just switching to a remote therapy session.
We'll do it at their house that way they can still get care, right?
There's always a way.
A, if you want to be creative, the question.
4:50
If you don't have any creative, there's no Solutions, right?
But there's always a way.
All right?
So if you can adopt that mindset because it's the only thing that's going to get you through this, all right.
Right now.
You have the opportunity, the best opportunity, the world to quit.
If the, if the best opportunity to quit right now, right?
And right now, believe it or not, this is the sunshine and rainbows part.
5:10
This is the part where everyone's, like, we're going to come together and your members are excited to like we're adapting.
We're not gonna let this go down.
Give it four weeks, give it six weeks.
Right, give it eight weeks when we're in the thick of this, right?
It's not going to be sunshine and rainbows and you have to remember who you are and who you want to be.
5:27
All right, you're going to look back and tell a story about what you did right now.
And it's going to tell you lessons of who you really are and who you choose to be.
All right.
So I'm just saying this because right now, it's fun, right?
I mean, sure Panic is one thing but it hasn't really settled yet.
5:44
All right.
And the thing is, is if you're encountering like, man, I don't have money man.
I'm Void.
Now, it's only going to get worse is not going to get better.
And so you have to develop a thick skin and guess what?
You're going to get really good at sales.
You want to make it through this, you can get real good at sales, alright?
6:00
And this experience that you're going to go through, is going to give you skill set.
That's going to feed you for the rest of your life because you get the opportunity to have a ton of sales opportunities that are going to come your way.
The lead flow right now is insane for remote like insane.
6:16
I haven't seen lead costs and Lead volumes like this, you know?
A very, very long time.
Alright.
So stacked appointments and you might, you might end up going 6420, but you made six sales more than the guy who wasn't trying.
Hey guys, real quick.
6:33
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career, I quench the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
7:01
Right.
And so that's the opportunity that we have right now in the nice thing is that we can actually make a good living selling remote training and providing value in a way that's actually in excess of what we did in person.
You have to remember, we were selling group in person.
7:19
Now, we are selling 101 remote.
One-on-one is always more valuable than group, okay?
So we have a way of providing an excess of value to our customers.
All right.
So you have to remember that now.
Big picture.
I've noticed that there's two ways of kind of overarching methods of fulfillment for remote.
7:38
I'm going to walk you through both.
I'm going to give you one warning thing, I should start with the warning.
First, I have noticed that right now.
There are some places that are doing pre-sales, okay, I would strong in order to get cash flow.
I feel strongly and saying boy, I would love to promote that but I feel extremely uneasy about it because if if you don't make it through it then you are.
8:01
In some serious shit because you're essentially stealing money.
All right?
So if you are not sure do not sell Peyton fools for a Time duration that you aren't even sure if you're going to be alive.
So in my opinion you need to reap.
Like that's why I'm a fan of a departure like you have to Pivot, right?
8:19
You got to Pivot the model like if you're not, if you're not allowed or able to fulfill solve problems the way that you were solving them.
Before you got to find a new way to solve the problem, you got to do it fast and right now you got to talk to your team and say listen there's me a lot of changes.
Happy right now.
I'm a lot of things were going to start over night when you're not ready for it because guess what, neither am I right?
8:37
Neither am, I gotta be honest.
Be like the inner mind, right?
Like we're rolling out, I mean we did a seven-day death cycle.
This was supposed to be done for the remote for Alan to work.
Leads, remotely was supposed to be like an end of Q2 mid Q3 project and we had an entire development team work in shifts around the clock for seven straight days to be able to create this, right?
8:58
And so I'm saying like it's going to be this is like this is war time.
Right.
And likes decisions are going to be made, you're gonna have to take faster action and that extent and the changes that you're going to have to Pivot, or going to be bigger than what you are used to.
And what I'm telling you is, it's okay, it's normal for this environment.
9:15
All right?
So to recap, the first thing that I wanted to say which is for everyone, you're going to get the obstacle, it's going to come up, I'm unemployed.
I don't want to spend money when I'm uncertain about my future and you can say listen there's always be a million things that are out of our control.
We should be focused on the few things that we can.
9:31
That's the overcome will people still say no?
Yes but guess what?
There's gonna be someone right behind them.
They're gonna have another opportunity to sell and help.
Alright, next point that I wanted to make here is that you need to stop giving away all your shit for free.
All right.
Tell you story.
9:48
There's gonna be, guys.
You can see it right now, we're giving away free checklist, free, whatever is, and you know what?
That's great.
That's awesome.
But I am going to reach so many more gems that everyone else because I'm going to build a better solution and I'm going to charge for it and because of that I'm going to be able to advertise and spread the message to a far like much further than everyone else's.
10:10
Okay.
And so for you you need to adopt the same mindset of.
How can I help the most people truly help.
All right, if you give a product typically you're not that concerned with how good it is, right?
Lowering your price has an excuse for yourself because you Aren't proud enough to give the thing at full price, okay, the rules of Economics, haven't changed, all you have to do is find the new problem and solve it.
10:33
All right?
Panic means pain, pain means problems.
Problems means opportunity for you as an entrepreneur to solve them.
So all it is is a new jigsaw puzzle.
You put the pieces together and then you can exchange value for money, good old-fashioned economics and the guys to do with the best are going to win, all right?
10:52
And so I'm saying right now is that I made a video eight months ago that got the entire gym Minister up in arms.
I was like, is Group Training dead?
Right.
And I said, right now we're at this read this point of commoditization, right?
A lot of guys are going under the right at the borderline.
One event would actually take the industry.
11:08
If you have no way of differentiating, like adding remote services and 101, you're going to be fucked, right?
Guess what?
Here we are.
Right?
And so the point of that is to say, if you adapt, you will have the opportunity to a actually make a higher profit margin here.
11:24
This.
Okay, so stop thinking, Doom and Gloom, you may have the opportunity to actually win and come out second.
If half the gyms are gone in 90 days in in 16 weeks, in five months, you you're going to be alive, you're going to be alive, and there's going to be such a massive opportunity for the people who have actually gobbled up market, share and took action.
11:45
So, the only thing that you can't do is be afraid, all right?
And just can't get down on yourself, all right, because there's going to be a million reasons in a million.
Good reasons that you should Right right now, a million really, very reasonable things that you could tell yourself that.
You can tell your family that you tell your dad, you tell your mom, all the people, whose opinions you care about.
12:03
And they would say, you know what, you know what, honey like you did your best and who is going to who's going to prepare for the pandemic, you know, once in a century but who's going to prepare for that?
It's not your fault honey or they could tell the story about despite that despite every other gym going out of business.
12:21
You were good enough you were fast enough, you found a way.
To make it through and that could be your story.
And so that's what I'm urging you to do because honestly what other choice do you have?
Alright, so anyways there's always a way if there's will and so as long as you keep your will you will find a way as a promise.
12:37
All right remote gym stuff is coming out tomorrow.
Super excited about it.
It's a way to acquire customers from Paid traffic and local markets and the entire fulfillment of hybrid to keep those in actually, get them at higher price point.
So anyways guys, love you all, stay in there.
12:53
You can fuck.
Can do this.
Talk to you guys soon.
Bye.
Can do this.
Talk to you guys soon.
Bye.









0:00
Most Nation real quick.

Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
0:18
It's going to be ugly.
There's going to be shit.
You're going to fuck up.
Your team is going to is going to be operated on incomplete info because the thing is, is like what other options do you have?
Welcome to the gym, Seekers podcast.
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
0:38
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on, everyone?
Happy Monday?
Hope you guys are rocking and rolling and doing and taking Massive Action.
I want to make a quick vid / podcast.
For those of you tuning in on the podcast.
0:55
Thank you about imperfect action and certainty.
And So a lot of you have either recently started pep, you know, had to make a massive pivot in your business or you've been Paralyzed by fear and so I wanted to hopefully address some of those concerns because I think they're incredibly common and they're definitely worth addressing.
1:15
And so I just got off the phone with somebody that owns a company.
That's very affected.
They work with chiropractors really no more affected than we are in the in the gym industry.
But doctors in general, tend to be a little bit more hesitant More analytical and honestly just a little slower to react to things and so I kind of wanted to share with you guys what I shared with him and so hopefully it will be valuable for you.
1:41
And the thing is is that all of us right now, have a choice to either take imperfect action or no action at all.
But the reality is that you can either take the choice or let your circumstances make the choice for you because the choice is going to be made.
And so right now, this is especially speaking or I miss Specially speaking to everyone, who likes to be perfect, wants to know exactly.
2:05
It's going to happen at every step wants it to be perfect.
Let me tell you it's not it's going to be ugly.
There's going to be shit.
You're going to fuck up.
Your team is going to is going to be operating on incomplete info because the thing is, is like what other option do you have, right?
2:22
Like, you can't wait a week, you can't wait two weeks once you've pressure tested everything, got in the process flows down and like It's not like the thing is, a lot of you guys had everything's cool.
And then the next day, you were announced, you're not allowed to do business, right?
So, if that's the kind of pressure and environment, we are currently in, you have to let your actions reflect that, right, like taking time, should reflect an environment where you might have time.
2:48
You don't have that right now.
And so, you have to paint for your team is is basically giving them emotional permission to feel not, okay?
And still act despite that.
So when your Talking to your team like like listen, like right after you explain everything to do like, like listen guys, I know this is not perfect, I know this is not even pretty, but what else we got, right?
3:12
What other choice do we have right now and all you hear is Cricket's because no one else has another solution.
You're like, alright, so this is the black plant like this is the best.
Best bad idea of got, all right?
And so when you're looking at a changing environment, what you're trying to do is look at what existing resources and skills do I have is a business it at my disposal that I can recalibrate and reset to meet a new market demand, right?
3:37
This is what businesses do over longer Cycles.
They call these S curves where an old product dies over time.
And then you begin our D on a new product.
In the beginning, it's not making money.
And all of a sudden starts taking off then becomes a mature product.
This is a normal cycle that happens in business, except we are being forced to do it in a week, right?
3:56
And do everything, change every system we have Does being real like yes most gym owners have to go from being an in-person business to an online business in seven days, right?
Never having done it.
Your team doesn't know how to do remote.
You don't know how to get Zoom to work.
4:12
You don't know what that, the communication came to cease to look like your clients.
Don't know how to make that stuff work.
What does it look like from scheduling standpoint?
How are we going to onboard new people?
There's a ton of things that you already unknown only did or were able to do without as much process in an in-person setting that you're now having To learn.
4:30
The thing is what's your choice right?
What are their chance?
You got?
And so one of the things that I wanted to convey to you, in terms of how you how you talk about these changes is certainty.
All right, now I can't remember the first time I heard this, it's not mine, but it was confidence for is for, boys and certainty is for men and mind you.
4:52
I understand that we have women on the call, just reflect everything I say in a female setting, same thing.
All right, we need to reflect certainty in times where you're not certain because that is what everyone is looking for.
From you as leader, right?
And you might not be but a lot of you guys have really heard the saying, Courage isn't acting without fear or acting in the absence of fear, but acting despite fear or taking action despite of how you feel.
5:20
And this is pretty much what we have to do right now.
Right?
And so if anything, all I want to do with this, with this one podcast is leave you with one single thing which is it's okay for you to fuck up right now.
Right?
But, what's not?
Okay, is for you to do nothing.
It's okay to take imperfect action.
5:36
You'll get better.
You've never sold over the phone before.
Guess what?
To learn real fast, right?
And guess what?
You're going to suck, why?
Because you've never done it before, right?
He's your remote fulfillment?
Going to be amazing.
No, of course not.
Why would it be you haven't done it before, right?
5:54
But that's okay.
Because, what other choice do you have?
All right, so I just like, I can just reflect this to you to give yourself a break about not being perfect but not give yourself a break about not doing anything, alright?
Like everyone needs to act, this is Acting all of us immediately right now.
6:12
And if you're in an area that isn't quarantined, do not be the guy with the dunce hat on who says, well, I'm going to wait, sure.
You don't like to getting a head start.
You don't like being prepared.
You don't like learning from other people's mistakes.
You want to wait for things to happen to you.
Awesome.
Good for you.
6:28
I think that humans have this unique Advantage.
We get to look at other human beings to say I'm going to learn from his mistake.
I'm gonna learn from his circumstance and we are unique situation.
Where history is littered.
Literally playing out, just a couple days, just a couple weeks ahead of time in other areas, so learn from it because don't think is not going to happen in your area, it will write.
6:50
None of us can get out of this anytime soon, right?
So you've got to adapt, you got to take imperfect action, it has to be massive because you're not going to take a small incremental shift from shift from a massive external change.
If you're a return listener and you have not rated or reviewed the show, I want you to know that you should feel absolutely terrible about yourself and everything else in the world getting but it would mean the absolute world to me.
7:16
If you guys would go ahead and do that, you don't have to pause the show, you keep listening and you can just do it with your thumb right now.
It'll take you less than 60 seconds.
And like I said, the only way that podcast arose through word of mouth and this is you joining hands with me and helping as many entrepreneurs with possibly can because no one is coming to save us, it's just us.
7:31
All right, so please go do that now then let's get back to the show.
All right, so all I want to say is, it's okay if you suck, it's okay.
If the things that you do don't work it as nearly as well as you wanted them to give yourself a break.
All right.
7:48
Big picture.
If you can eliminate your rent, which you should be able to do now.
Mind you, I'm not a lawyer, talk to your legal console, blah, blah, blah, all that.
But I think if I were a betting person, I would bet that there's going to be a lot of credit forgiveness.
It's going to happen, especially for businesses that were purposely shut down by the government.
8:07
Right.
We're massively affected, due to coronavirus and so most banks have already come out and said they're forgiving or at least offering forbearance to landlords for mortgages.
If your landlord doesn't have to pay his mortgage you and all likelihood are not get penalized for not paying your rent, I'm saying that you're a grown-ass person.
8:24
You should make her own decisions, but if it were me, I would be conserving cash flow and only focused on one thing which is acquisition.
Okay?
The one thing you cannot stop is marketing and says, why, because the Moment you stop.
It is the moment that you have cut off the lifeline of your business.
8:41
It's a moment that no new customers are going to enter your basically begun the ticking clock, okay, which is why you need to get uncomfortable, learn a new acquisition process, learn a new fulfillment process of selling over the phone selling over, Zoom fulfilling or resume having Zoom workouts, having remote check-ins.
8:59
You got to learn how to do it or it's not going to happen, right?
So I could think it's like, what other choice do you have?
And so I'd be conserving my cash flow.
Art for that.
So, first thing is, I'm going to remove the expenses around providing value.
If your gym is not provide your physical location is no longer providing value.
That would not be my prioritizing, it's of where I would spend my cash flow number one.
9:17
Number two, it takes in every state Most states, especially it takes 90 days for someone to evict you, okay?
Now if your landlord, what do you think the likelihood is that?
You're going to get a new tenant after that 90 days is over in the economy, economic situation, being probably low got to think from their perspective, all right?
9:35
Would they rather give some months of free?
Rent or give some for Barrett's so that they could potentially keep you on the longer side.
Probably.
So that's the first thing you're going to do, all right?
The next one and I'm just, I'm just being real.
You have to keep the business alive.
Alright.
So that means that you have to let go of non-essential employees who are not going to provide value in the new setting.
9:55
This is what's key.
It's not saying you are not valuable person that I don't love you.
I love you, I absolutely do.
You're like, I love all humans, but in this business, these are the new requirements for how we provide value.
If you can no longer provide value in this, in this new new vehicle, then there's really no place for you here.
10:13
Now, that being said, there's economic programs from the government, there's an employment, there's all these things that these people can apply for so that you can keep the business alive.
So that hopefully come 90 days or four months or five months or whatever it is, you will have a business for them to come back to all right.
10:29
Now, if you've eliminated your fixed overhead with rent, right?
And you've cut a lot of the over that was associated with the payroll.
And what do you have left?
You should still have a decent amount of recurring, Revenue that you've built up over this time.
Now, even if you lost 30% or 40% from freezes and cancels, that's okay.
10:47
Quick side note, don't let anyone cancel?
They can only freeze, okay?
So if someone's like, hey, I want to, I want to cancel be like, no, no.
So we're actually not accepting you cancels.
We're just pausing it to her openness and fair cool to, at least this way.
When you do, reopen backup, you don't have to go find them and resell them, all right?
11:03
So just giving you that right now.
But if they do pause, they don't to do it.
There's nothing to do about.
All right?
So say, you lose 40% in your EFT.
Recurring revenue is a 15,000, right?
And you lose 40%, so you're down six.
All right.
That means you have 9,000 recurring left.
If you have no rent, you only have one person who's assisting you, you may actually be able to make more money.
11:24
Crazy like eight or nine months ago, I pushed I was like, hey guys, I think you guys should prepare with a remote control.
I call it hybrid but a remote fun system, right?
Because you're going to be able to prepare and have another way of providing high value, high margin Services.
There's this beautiful instance right now, we're being encouraged to switch towards higher profit model, okay?
11:45
And so you should all take a moment and think about what this means.
I know it's change but just because it's change doesn't mean it's bad.
So like you'd like internalized that just because it's changed, doesn't mean it's bad.
Remote is better business model.
It's a higher profit model.
12:00
It has more scales to it.
There's number of benefits to it.
Okay.
So at least we didn't get like shafted into a worse business model.
We actually are like, we're being gifted a true reason why a true cart launched, a permission slip from the world to actually switch to a more profitable model?
12:18
And it is all we have to do right now is just learning and be okay.
Okay, and give ourselves permission to suck a little bit.
In the beginning, you're not going to be perfect as it is, it's clean as your gym, no clean.
Being fulfillment.
Germ joke, not included.
No, it's not.
12:34
Of course, it's not.
That's okay.
It's just give yourself a break but you just can't do nothing.
All right, just got to take action and you got to get right back on the phone when you have somebody hang up on you because his first time you sold over the phone and you got to get right back on the next phone, call the smile with good energy.
Look at yourself in the mirror fun trick.
12:51
If you've never Over the phone find something that's reflective.
If you can't just turn on your zoom, on your computer and just look at your face while you're talking, your tone will change, you will speak better.
It's an old-school sales track.
Alright, use that if you don't know how to fix your tongue.
All right.
13:07
So I know it's a little bit.
If you like 16, tiny different nuggets in different directions and it's because times are chaotic right now.
And I know.
Hopefully, hopefully for somebody needed to hear that.
But what you cannot do is do nothing because it's not going to fix itself.
For men, it coming.
13:23
All right, it's just us.
So anyways lots of love hope you guys who are are hanging in there are hanging in there, we'll get through this together.
Thankfully, we're in an industry that we could actually very easily pivot to remote.
All right there already existed in industry for remote Fitness.
So like like thankfully be grateful that we have something that we can do that switching to remote restaurant, much more difficult switching to remote events doing Zoom events not necessarily as valuable as an in-person you.
13:52
No three day event right here in wedding.
Planner kind of hard to do.
Zoom weddings, right?
So be grateful for what we got.
All right, so anyways, love you all.
Hope you guys stay positive because if you don't know him as well,

One of the nice reminders.
Just depending on what side of the coin you're on.
0:31
It's realized that it's not your fault.
If you're down and it's also not your fault.
If you're up, welcome to the gym Secrets podcast, we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
0:49
Good morning everyone.
Happy Tuesday.
I wanted to make a quick video for you guys on winning in a recession and Layla and I've been spending a lot of time basically looking at what companies did during the last recession.
Because History, A lot of times really good teacher.
1:04
Now is the same as this recession.
Now, you know that we're in or about to go into.
No, it's not, but there's definitely some lessons that, you know, we're taking from this that I figured I'd share one of His of this kind of defining what winning means, right?
1:20
And so in a recession, you know, it in this in this weird recession, there's been a basically a reshuffling of the deck of demand over night and everyone was dealt in these new set of cards, right.
And some guys are experiencing overwhelming growth to know to no effort over their own and others are getting crushed again to no, real effort on their own.
1:42
And so, one of the one of the nice reminders is depending on what side of the coin.
Iran to realize that it's not your fault.
If you're down and it's also not your fault if you're up.
So it's because there was any smart maneuver is just because the depth is reidel.
Now, that being said, if you look at some of the companies that did really well, a lot of them did a couple, a lot of things that were similar one is that they eliminated more costs than they were comfortable with earlier on so that they can conserve cash flow.
2:11
All right.
You look at GE some of the big companies that did well in the last restaurant owner.
All right now, but in the last recession they came out.
Strong.
The next thing was they a lot of them ended up cutting prices and increasing the value that they were providing.
2:29
And so it's like wait, how do I cut prices increase value.
That's kind of where the Innovation comes in as like, how can we do more for our customers and charge less and believe me.
I'm the biggest Advocate, the world of keeping the price is high, but I'm also a realist.
And so I want to share the things that we're seeing from history.
2:47
Hurry, that proved effective in science and kind of some of these times.
One of the things that's also useful is defining what winning looks like.
And I think one of the things that can beat down in entrepreneur more than anything is expectations.
And so in thinking that we are going to grow during a receding economy, not as likely especially for a discretionary expenditure as much as we wish to say that.
3:14
We are an essential good.
You can see that the government And the World At Large has said that gyms and Fitness in general or not in the central business.
You can put your statements about that, you know, out there if you want to, but it's not going to change anything.
And so I think redefining winning a surviving is very useful.
3:34
So as much as you may see posts and things of people winning, I will tell you this and I'm also saying this have to my community is that the winds are many times isolated or there in one officer.
Come stances.
Somebody has a single good day of sales.
3:50
I would not extrapolate that for every single day of the month and I'm saying that because I want to hopefully conserve your mental well-being.
All right, so that you don't think wow I just suck at life from horrible because everyone's going to have a hard time.
And so you just need to redefine winning is getting through and really you're going to feel like you're just barely surviving in.
4:09
That is what surviving feels.
Like here's the good news.
Is that for the for the entrepreneurs, and the gym owners that that get Through this, there will be an outsized opportunity on the other side, right?
Because there's going to be a consolidation of the market.
There's going to be on the out, on the back end of this more demand than there is Supply and gym owners are going to very quickly.
4:29
Be able to assume a lot of market share and that's where you grow and where you get disproportionate returns and you get higher profit and higher growth than the rest of the market at large.
And if you think about how this is going to look for a lot of businesses coming out of it, The ones that experience disproportionate growth will also have a disproportionate decline in growth, you know, toilet paper, all of a sudden if everyone buys lots of toilet paper now what are they going to do in the future?
4:52
They're going to already have enough toilet paper, right?
I'm just saying simplistically, but it does work like that at a macro scale.
And one of the things I had a discussion with my car sees a friend of mine.
He, he talks a lot of times every day as well and it's a big Network like we do of gyms and we were talking about kind of different entrepreneur.
5:13
Architects, different entrepreneurial cycle.
Graphs of the people who are kind of in it right now and I think there's kind of four categories that you would draw a square that people kind of exist in.
I think on the bottom bottom right of that would be somebody who probably shouldn't have been a business owner.
5:31
I think those people will get weeded out during the consolidation and it's just because there are some people that really, you know, struggle in a good economy, right there barely getting by in a Good economy.
And when a bad economy comes, it kind of just shows the weaknesses in the business and even their mindset and their level of commitment to their business.
5:53
And that's okay.
I mean, business isn't for everyone and I think that that this, this will create a gut check for a lot of those people and they may not make it out.
I hope they all do.
However, I hope no one was out, this is, but I don't think that's reality.
The next category is somebody who underperformed because of talent?
6:09
And so that's somebody who.
And I've seen them in our community guys who just get by on talent, but don't work super hard, but I think some people who are in this category, may rise to the occasion.
So all of a sudden when their backs against the wall, they're going to double down to learn how good of an entrepreneur they really can be.
6:26
And I think that's kind of cool because I think a lot of people will level up during this period of time because pressure makes diamonds and I think that they realize what they are.
Are capable of and it may get they may come out of this much much stronger than they were going into it because they realize what they're capable of.
6:41
And I'm hopeful for anybody who was struggling before that, you were in the former sorry, latter category instead of the former I have and I hope from a, from a my to same point that you adopt that which is like was I really trying as hard as I possibly could have before, was I really doing 100 outbound reach out to every day.
7:01
No matter what was I really making sure that I followed my script.
With the correct tonality on every sales, call no matter what I did.
I make sure to follow up with my customers and if all of this sounds like work, it's because it is, and there's no way to not work through this, all right, so, I'm just telling, like, what am I doing?
7:17
I'm going to try and provide more value to the gym owners Community.
I'm going to be you guys find out tomorrow or later today, but I'm going to be taking all the, you know, daily calls every single day with all the customers.
Just something that I haven't done in almost two years.
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
7:36
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
7:59
So I'm going to try and provide more value to our community to continue to keep everyone engaged.
And hopefully answer questions at a higher level and just get everyone, you know, Peace of Mind etcetera.
So those are two of the four archetypes I think that you have another archetype of person who's going to just be a winner, right?
8:21
And winners win.
There's the guys who are crushing it before and these are the guys who during this transition have lost the fewest.
Remember because they already had strong communities, they ran fairly lean.
And if they didn't, they made the correct entrepreneurial decisions at the right time to conserve cash flow, right?
8:38
They made the hard decisions in terms of rent and had the hard conversations with non-essential Personnel in order to keep the ship upright.
Those people will be in a position at the end of this to consolidate market share and they will be the ones who come out on top and make the most and really are in a position that point too.
8:58
We brought a hybrid facility which is the highest profit model that I'm aware of, which is why I put it out there.
Eight months ago, there was a fourth category.
I think it's, I think it's the person who had that had that eye of the tiger had a successful gym, that was somewhat out sourced.
9:19
But then it's unwilling to go back in and roll their sleeves up.
And I think that that also would be the type of person who will not make it through.
So, if you had the Four.
Quadrants you've got the low performer who's barely hanging on before this, who probably doesn't have the entrepreneurial character traits, who is usually not adaptable enough.
9:39
Who's not a quick enough star who does not pivot who gets analog, who gets, you know, analysis, paralysis wants things to be perfect, is more security driven and just honestly doesn't know what to do and can lead to crisis.
Those people will probably get weeded out.
Second category, people who were highly talented and then we'll be able to rise to the occasion and level up.
9:58
Search for indoors during this.
And I hope that that's most the people who are listening who were not where they wanted to be.
Third category, is the outright, you know, hardcore winners.
Those guys will always win and they will make it through.
They might not win as much during the recession, but then they will get outsized returns and basically make up for the winds that they would have had during this period of time in the outside is growth.
10:22
That happens later and then the kind of guy who used to be used to be hungry in his little no longer.
One of the things that I wanted to kind of pass on to you that I've been, I've been chewing a lot on mentally has been really understanding how much market dynamics can affect an environment.
10:42
So if you look at investors, there's like an old investment saying, which is like a great Market with a mediocre entrepreneur will create a great business, a great entrepreneur in a mediocre Market, create a mediocre business and the whole point.
10:58
That the market is ultimately one of the biggest deciders, and I'm not saying that so that you can be a victim because you shouldn't be, and there's, you should only control the variables, you can control.
But I say this more to say, if you see people who are just crushing it right now in different adjacent, Industries are industries that to no effort on their own because no one had the foresight to think that there was going to be a flu.
11:21
And if anyone who says that, you know they didn't short the US economy, right?
If they disrupt the US economy than yes, congrats.
But most of them did not and So unless they made that move they didn't know and they just got to reshuffle deck of cards where they got, they got Aces.
11:36
And so I'm saying this more so so that you don't beat yourself up about it because like, they didn't do anything special and neither did you do anything wrong?
All right, it's just things happen and we have to adapt and so winning in a recession will look like for many people just getting through it.
11:54
And that's why I think the word that I gave him, my community is just, you just got to endure.
Right.
That's what you have to tell yourself, all right?
If you used to sell one out of three in person, you're going to have to level up your sales skills because you were selling.
One out of three, in-person in a good economy, in a flush economy and overnight.
12:15
Now you're selling in a less familiar scenario over the phone or resume and you're selling in a bad economy.
And so if one out of three goes to 1 out of 6 in your average ticket drops, it becomes harder, right?
And getting five nose out of Six is rough emotionally.
12:30
And so what's going to happen?
You're going to crack.
They're going to build character, right?
I think there was, this saw this meme.
I can remember, was independent of your religious beliefs.
It doesn't really matter, but it was it was like somebody's like me, make me make me patient like Jesus.
12:48
And then it said, life, it's like our God gives me trials and hardship, right?
And so like the things that happen to us, end up growing our character, more than anything else does.
And I think if Can reframe the things that we go through, is things that are going to grow us can help shape our shift, our perspective during times that can be trying, right?
13:07
Winning doesn't teach us much, but losing sure does.
And so, if you can relay that to your team, in terms of like, we didn't do anything wrong, the deck was reshuffled over night and day out and we were all W hands.
All right.
We didn't like you didn't fuck up.
13:22
There wasn't anything big strategic move.
That wasn't made.
It was just like, this is a new reality for now.
And I think if you reset that and you can lower your expectation that doesn't excuse you from working your absolute face off.
Because in order to get through it, you're going to work your absolute face off.
13:39
You're going to have to be willing to do that.
And the two categories that I had, if the people who are going to, we're going to lose the guy who lost his hunger to fight has outsourced.
Everything doesn't want to jump back in and rolls, roll up his, or her sleeves.
And then the person who was basically not really fit for business, to begin with, those are the two categories that are going to fall off.
13:57
But you'll notice that in Common most of them just were not willing to put in the work and this period of time, right?
The guy who is talented in wasn't working hard enough and then starts to work and the guy who always worked hard and was a winner, both of those people make it out.
All right, so it's redefining what winning looks like understanding, which of those for you are and then hopefully moving towards like action because the only thing that's going to get you out of it action alleviates anxiety, whenever you are stressed.
14:26
I can tell you that working not Not being busy but working productively is the only thing that's going to really help you get through this.
And so, so I'll have for you to my word of encouragement, in der, you got this I'm going to try and make more of these just to kind of let you know where I'm at.
14:44
But, you know, I just want you to know I believe in you.
I'm 100% is tied to this as you are even any, any, any stress that you feel?
I have a lot of employees and I have a lot of payroll.
And I have a lot of gym owners that I serve and they and I feel the weight of solving the issues for the industry.
15:06
And I just I'm going to leave you with one one.
Final thing is Don't be fooled by Peoples posts.
I don't be fooled by Peoples posts knowing, like, unless like, no one is going to be absolutely murdering right now.
Independent of Industry, right?
15:23
Like, there's going to be oxidized Demand, right?
Like, toilet paper and stuff but there's, there's problems that are there.
I got a call from a friend of mine that grew six hundred percent and he was like, dude, I'm like I can't even staff this.
Like, I like my entire supply chain is totally screwed because I like it's, this is going to kill me in six.
15:40
That's right.
And so there's always going to be problems.
And so, like The Grass Is Always Greener, and it looks like it, but there's always problems in any business, when there's a massive shift and so just don't beat yourself up about it.
Understand that expectations have to change for you first but it doesn't excuse you from not working your ass off because that's we're all going to have to do to get through.
15:40
That's right.
And so there's always going to be problems.
And so, like The Grass Is Always Greener, and it looks like it, but there's always problems in any business, when there's a massive shift and so just don't beat yourself up about it.
Understand that expectations have to change for you first but it doesn't excuse you from not working your ass off because that's we're all going to have to do to get through.









0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else I wanted to bring you.
You a question that Layla asked me yesterday?
She was, like, what would you actually do?
Like, right now, like what like, if you had, if you were, you know, roll back the time clock, and this has happened, when we had our six gems, like what would your actual?
0:43
What would you do to approach this?
And what would your plate?
Welcome to the gym, Secrets podcast, we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Everyone, happy Wednesday.
1:00
I slept like a cherub which is a small angel baby last night, my gosh.
I feel like a human being and so I wanted to bring you a question that Lila asked me yesterday and I thought that would be a good podcast topic.
She was like, what would you actually do?
1:16
Like right now like what like, if you had, if you were, you know, roll back the time clock, and this has happened when we had our six gems, like what would your actual?
What would you do to approach this?
And what would your playdate?
So I want to own a first, just at least say, with my big disclaimer here.
1:32
Is that something that I don't discuss a lot, but I think is worth mentioning, is that the advice that I give in general, I try to cater to the audience that I'm speaking to.
If I ran a gym, I would probably run it somewhat differently than what we espouse.
1:49
And that is because I am not you and you are not me.
And so I would rather have a solution that I can get 90% of them.
Marketplace to get an 80% win rather than have five person in the marketplace, get 100% whey and I've run my business that way.
2:05
And I think that is why we've been really successful is because it's the same thing with like a weight loss program.
Like if I can get, if I could get, you know, 90% of people to have a great result rather than, you know, 10% of people to have crazy, crazy result, then I would rather serve the 90 Elon Musk even talks about this.
2:25
He's like, I'd rather do a good amount.
For a ton of people rather than a lot for a very small amount.
And so we've taken the same approach in terms of how we, you know.
Like, when we make offers all my focuses on, how can I make the best offer that anyone can sell?
Right, how can I make a sales process?
2:41
It's so easy.
Anyone could do it.
Not necessarily like, for me, I'd be selling High ticket over the phone all day long.
Right?
But a very small small segment could actually do that successfully at scale.
So that's my first disclaimer.
Now that being said, this is exactly what I would do if My gyms in a, we're in the midst of this, you know, covid stuff.
3:03
So first off I would get out of the leases that I have now independent of because there's some beer.
Like whoa, we're going to get out of this scenery know this side.
I have no idea but I know is just opportunity if I have the opportunity to to flip my facilities in an environment where I'm being encouraged by both government and my clients to make the flipper.
3:28
Not open, then I'm going to take that opportunity and flip to a more profitable model, right?
Like, we're giving we're being given permission in this instance to do that with the zero repercussions.
It's even being encouraged.
And so, the first thing is, I would take all six.
I have my recurring basis of members and I would flip them to remote now.
3:46
Then I would try and cut all of the rent for each of those locations, maybe even get out of the lease, I would likely just trying to go shit, 36 months of free rent.
See how it shakes out, but likely This is what I'm saying.
I would do.
You don't need to do this.
All right, let's say like this is how I would.
4:03
This is how I would play my cards, right?
And so what happen is, let's say each of those gyms that 30,000 a month, right in recurrent, just EFT is not front in cash flow, nothing else not supplement, just like they're doing 30,000 month.
Cool.
So now I've got a hundred eighty thousand, a month that I have in recurring.
4:20
Now let's be realistic.
Let's say 25 percent of those people drop off because it's not an owner operated facility.
I've got staff, they don't care as much.
They're not.
Rubbin bellies and kissing babies the way I would, if I were in a single location.
And so let's say I lose 25%, so that means I lose roughly 45,000 off that I think no 40.
4:41
Yeah.
Right. 40-ish, right.
So who's forty thousand a thousand now I'm down to like one 40-ish or 135 per month.
That's my recurring nut.
Okay, it's a lot of cash.
They're all right, then I would take my best trainer at each facility.
The guy the guy or gal.
4:58
Who cared the most, who is the most engaged with members, who is the most upbeat the most positive and truly cared about keeping them.
And I might have to take two at each facility if there's too many for one person to handle, that's fine.
The rest of my Personnel would be considered non-essential because in this new model they would not be able to provide value.
5:15
All right, that's what I would do.
Alright, so I've got this, we got six, that means I've got 12 staff that I'm keeping on to maintain a hundred, thirty-five thousand dollars in recurring Revenue per month.
Now let's say conservatively.
Each of these people three thousand dollars a month, right?
5:31
Just stay at home.
Now, that's a great.
For some of these guys, I might actually be a big payday jump from what they were doing in person.
Cool.
So another making 3,000 a month staying home to just provide accountability.
All right, that is it so big, big thing here now, like a gym launch, what we're doing is we have we just so I'm taking this off today.
5:52
Starting on Monday, we're running 16 remote workouts per day, basically, every hour during The normal work day, there's going to be a class that's being held.
And that way all of our gyms can cut their overhead and just have all of those workouts, as fulfillment for their online clients, right?
6:08
And so, now, they don't even have to staff that stuff.
It's already been taken care of, centrally by all of us.
All margins can participate that cut their overheating further right now?
Rewind back to the six gems.
So, step one, I'm going to get out of the leases that I can because because right now, you have a pretty good opportunity to break Lisa's.
6:25
And or at the very least, get 36 months of Rent right now.
So that's 12.
I would flip my recurring Revenue into remote which would be nutrition and accountability primarily I'd have the workouts that are being done.
6:40
If I have 12 trainers, I can take each of you guys a response for one workout a day.
That's it.
That's one every hour and that allows all of my people to participate in a session at any given time but it's not that hard because you can do it from home, right?
And the whole point is that like I'd love to say it's going to be from the gym, but reality, if you're getting quarantined, you might Not be able to even go to the gym.
6:59
So, and most of the clients are consuming this from their homes.
And so, it would make sense.
Have a train us from home, not a big deal.
So, that's, that's what I have on The Workout Part, big, big caveat here.
No one cares about the workouts.
If you're selling over the phone, you can get workout apps online, you know, like, you know, Beachbody and peel.
7:16
It seems gotta sweat out.
Like, there's all these other apps that are like 10 to 20 dollars a month that have probably better already pre-existing stuff.
You're not going to win on the work out front, right?
You're going to win on the accountability and the That's how we've always won and that's how we need to keep.
Like, remember the rules, haven't changed your workouts, never mattered, they don't matter.
7:34
Now right, what matters is the relationship that you have?
These people that they feel like someone is checking in, on the right?
They pay for you to pay attention.
That's how it works.
Alright.
So I have my 12 trainers, let's say, I said I'm paying him 3,000 a month, so I'm paying thirty six thousand a month and overhead for those trainers, right?
7:50
And the only thing they have to do every day is one workout and then reach out to the customer, so make sure that they are being taken care of, Making sure that their head space is good.
Making sure that they're not going to the pantry and rating it and getting cookies every day, make sure it making sure that they attend one of the workouts, that is what they do all day.
8:05
Now that's it's all they have to do.
All right now overnight by doing this.
Hey guys, love that you're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects more visuals, more graphs, you don't drawn out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
8:25
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, I have 100,000 a month that's left over in all profit.
Holy smokes.
8:40
That's a pretty good deal, but wait.
Now what do I do with my time, right?
So my time will be focused.
The other thing that I would ask them to do is dedicate their first two hours of the day every day to doing 100 cold reach outs.
All right, they want to pay for themselves.
8:57
Cool, 100 cold, reach out.
What you do is if you have someone who's interested, you book them on, Mike.
Calendar, I'll close them.
All right so I'm going to fill my day with appointments that my team, my 12 people doing reach outs are going to set for me.
9:12
Alright and then I'm going to close beyond that.
I'm going to start turning on cold traffic.
And I'm going to run because right now in this hypothetical environment, which is the real environment currently lead costs are like 50% to 75% off.
It's nuts, right?
I've never seen anything like this, it's crazy.
9:30
And so we would be scheduling phone calls.
To sell.
And so my trainers day, looks like this first two hours of the day, all they're doing is doing cold retails.
They get their daily 100 and you give me 100 Reach Out sites.
What you owe me?
All right, get me one schedule, today.
I don't care.
Just give me one schedule today.
9:46
All right, what are they going to say?
They're going to say, hey name, do you know anybody who's trying to stay in shape during the quarantine who doesn't want to get?
Make turn their sweatpants into yoga pants?
By the end of this ha, right?
Whatever.
Now when you say that all of a sudden, the people who are responding or like oh this person is not fishing there asking genuinely If I know anybody, right?
10:04
And now, more than ever people have a lot of Goodwill that they want to help out other small business owners like that is definitely the Zeitgeist of This Moment.
Like I said, German word for the general Vibe of an era anyway.
So people are trying to help small business owners.
If you're asking like that, you're not even soliciting them.
You're just saying, hey, do you know anybody?
A lot of times would like, you know, I'm trying not to lose weight.
10:22
Perfect.
Or gain weight.
Perfect.
Let's get you booked for a call.
We have totally remote thing to make sure that you stay healthy and Cetera, right?
So the first two hours, they're doing the daily reach outs, then they're doing all the retest to their existing customers Is that they're maintaining right.
And then one hour of the day, they're required to do their work out.
10:38
Now, most of the time you want to have your your trainers are working out.
Anyways, at homes, it's like just record it, like, have fun with it, right?
And then that way, all of my people can actually have more sessions than they ever had in person.
So, I'm adding value, then from what I used to have, they have more availability of we've ever had.
10:53
They have more variety because they probably have access to trainers that they couldn't have had access to before.
All right.
And it's also my best coaches, so it's like, you know, we all know, we have got a couple coaches, you run stuff.
And if somebody uses news coming in, you probably want to put them with Jessica and not Eric right now.
I know Jessica's awesome.
Don't put in Eric's as her first session, right?
11:10
Maybe.
Maybe save that for some of the later people who already like us.
Right?
So those are the trainers were going to be getting those at home workouts.
Big picture again, big reminder.
No one cares, right?
Don't cares about the workouts, they only care about the underbelly, all right?
So if I flip my gyms right?
I renegotiate my least, I push them out where I break them, I take my recurring, I'll get into 100% remote, I would let go of non-essential Personnel who are not who are not at generating revenue or keeping Revenue through fulfillment, right?
11:36
They're generating Revenue in their first two hours of the day by getting you calls the rest of their day.
They're focused on doing the Fulfillment for the, for the clients 30, having maintaining that EFT and recurring, they're feeling back the bucket because I'm going to be doing the sales, because in a time of strife, I'm going to do what I do and I had to do best and make it rain, right?
11:53
And so the people were not gonna be able to succeed as a once you don't want to roll up their sleeves and get dirty.
If you're the best salesman at your gym, then you should sell.
That's you should be doing, right?
And then they do their one workout today.
So that's why I have trainers have to do three things reach out to get new customers.
Reach out to existing customers.
12:10
Make sure they know we're paying attention and then finally that they're doing one workout a day which they should be doing for themselves.
Anyways, they're just going to record it.
Awesome box is checked.
All right, my day is going to be making sure that we're marketing and filling the bucket back up.
All right.
That's it.
That's my dad.
All right, so, I'm marketing and taking sales calls, I'm taking sales calls from pay traffic taken, sales calls, from, from outbound.
12:29
I'm taking sales calls all day long.
That is what?
My job.
Job is to make it rain and feed the machine, all right?
That is what I would have done if I had been in that situation or in this situation I'm not necessarily saying you do that.
I'm telling you what I would have done and that would be the play that I would do because it would give me permission to overnight transform six facilities into one, massive recurring Revenue stream.
12:53
That's 100% remote.
That is higher higher, profit margin for fulfillment and I would say what I said yesterday, but I'll say it again.
So hopefully it sinks in.
Is that Just because this is change, does not mean it's bad, right?
Eight months ago I walked through all the math about why having a remote filament is a better solution.
13:09
There's a reason people like going online right there are better margins right.
There are the thing is that a lot of people felt like, for some reason that that was bad.
That's okay.
But now, people are being forced to do.
It doesn't mean it's bad.
It actually makes more money and now we're getting permission from the government and from society to do this for ourselves.
13:27
So I would take that opportunity and run with it.
So, That's my recognize, my Reckoning, she's me, that's what I would have done.
You can take that for what you will, but that is exactly what I would have done, step by step if that's how it is broken out my trainers.
That's what I would have done with my overhead.
That's what I would have redefined their pockets possibilities as and then beyond just lead them through the crisis are also trying to paint a vision or for a better future.
13:50
It's like guys you like unless you're staying at home can work out whenever you want.
You're just actually getting people get results because we're making sure that they're just an accountant when they need it.
The most right?
And one small note that I Want to add to this when you're selling, or when you're talking to customers, everyone right now is at the airport.
14:08
So if you've noticed everyone, the airport is always this like immediately a 3 out of 10 3 out of 5 stressed right.
They're already at six out of ten stress lungs.
What people want is to feel good, all right, and so that's going to end.
So when you get on the phone, if you want to sell, right, you got to make them feel good.
14:27
Like the fundamentals have not changed.
It's just, you got a little bit more resistance when your start up because they're already at a negative point, they're not at neutral.
Most people are not going to be a little bit - because their quarantine to get their kids around, they feel like shit, they're smelly there, you know, they, they feel sloppy and Bloated, because they're eating cookies all day, right?
14:44
And, you know, they're uncertain about the future what they want from you.
What your employees want from you?
What your clients want from you and what your prospects, when you get on the phone with them want from?
You is one word hope.
All right.
So you have to be the Hopeless, motherfucker that exists, all right?
15:00
In the way that you have hope is that you have optimism about what you are willing to do to endure it.
As long as you know, that you're willing to endure just about anything to get through this.
Then you have confidence and certainty in the fact that you will get through this.
And you can, you can control convey that can Action to your prospects to your team and to your to your customers because that's what they're going to want.
15:23
They like right now, therapies, blown up.
Life coaching is blowing up in terms of like growth, tons of people want life coaches.
Tons of people want therapist right now because they're stressed out of their minds.
And so if you're looking for more ways to provide value, someone will buy after how you've made them feel from the first 15 minutes of the phone call, the first 15 minutes is just like caring about them, throw them, some love making them feel good about Like, Hey, we're going to get through this, no worries, right?
15:50
They want to be around more of that.
They want more of that feeling.
The fact that you're going to sell them weight loss.
And that's going to be the vehicle that you monetize is almost secondary to how you will make them feel in that moment because they're just going to want to feel more of that.
And so that goes for your Trainers for mining them.
16:05
Dude, like we're trying to make people feel good right now.
We're trying to get people through this.
Like, if we can get him to put down the cookies and move a little bit, they're probably gonna feel better.
And if that's what, that's what our value is right now.
Then that's what it's going to be.
All right?
So that is What I would do step by step.
If I had my gym drink covid right now, I make no recommendations.
16:22
You are all grown as individuals and make your own decisions for yourself, but that is what I would do.
So.
Anyways, hope you have an amazing Wednesday.
Keep Rockin.
You can make it through this, he's got to want it.









0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur you can adapt and buying is actually stronger if you have the correct.
Text messaging.
Welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
0:40
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on up ahead to Tuesday.
Hope you guys are rocking and rolling and ribbon, and roarin, and doing all the things that you are should be doing for your business to grow.
So, I want to talk about a couple things right now because we are in a recession or about to be in one.
0:58
So I wanted to cover, what people pay for now and kind of a how to change your messaging, be how to change your product and pricing and see, at least a special note for anybody who's in Fitness, how to make more valuable Services, okay?
What people pay for right now, the entire, if you look at like all of Jim launches ads, we turn off all our old ads and turn on new ads, almost overnight to acquire customers, and we are doing it well.
1:24
And the reason is because we switched from what I would consider Prosperity Doctrine to preservation Doctrine.
And so you have to make sure that your messaging in terms of how you're communicating clients is no longer about the opportunity of necessarily crazy before and after transformation, its Etc.
1:44
But moreso preserving what they have already like, keep what you've already had.
Don't get worse because right now, every like all of my neighbors, 100% flipped, and it happens for very short periods of time.
And if you learn and adapt to that, you can actually capitalize on it.
Now, most people are very adaptive and they don't capitalize it because they just keep trying to do the thing.
2:02
That was they were doing before, and then they get stuck, because people don't know how to adapt, right?
But I'm telling you because you're smart and listening that you can adapt and buying is actually stronger.
If you have the Text messaging.
Okay, so what else do people respond to right now discounts savings?
2:20
All right, the entire all of Walmart and budget shopping was birthed out of the Great Depression.
All right?
That spawned an enormous.
I mean, it's Walmart still, you know, fifth largest company, whatever it is, you know, the world, a huge, huge, huge companies, right?
They came out of a changing buying behavior and it happened because people were now super budget-conscious.
2:40
It didn't mean they didn't spend money.
They just wanted to make sure they're getting a deal.
Want to make sure they're getting a bargain.
They want to make sure they're eating discount.
And so we think about how your marketing and how you're presenting offers to prospects if rather than saying, hey, if you want to get the best thing, it goes from being the premium offer to being best value.
2:57
And it's and literally, every other time in the world, you always want to flip that.
You always want to like in every Marketplace.
You've probably heard me say this.
There's two winners, the best in the cheapest, right?
And so, in this little environment that we have right here, some themes that we've adopted that we've adopted at Jim launch.
3:13
Our Or for the same, right?
So we're gonna give you more than we ever did before for the same price.
So that's number one.
That's an easy way for want to maintain the customers.
You have start adding far more value than you were before to maintain them at that same level, right?
And think, what would I what would I charge like before this for five hundred dollars a month and now I need to continue to provide that a 200 dollar month level, right?
3:38
It's a businesses that structure themselves for efficiency in operations of the ones who come out of the super strong.
And then, that is why that, once the economy, shifts around, back to normal, they explode because they structure themselves in such way that they focused.
Like, if you look at Amazon Jeff, Bezos said, there are some businesses that are structured to provide value so that they can charge as much as possible.
4:01
And there are other businesses that seek to continue to improve so they can charge as little as possible.
He said, we are the ladder, right?
And that was, it's always been Amazon strategy, he said your profit margins.
My That being said, he's had a bazillion dollars in funding and he's almost had free money for like 10 years.
4:18
And he's kind of a one, a unicorn type style.
But the the fact of the matter remains is that you're right now, you have to look at your operations and think, how can I structure this so that I can be as operationally efficient as possible, so that I can provide as much value as possible to the people that I have, right?
4:33
So it's more for the same is kind of the theme that we've had internally it.
Jim launch, and that's, that's kind of been our look North Star in terms of how we're you know, Creating our products and the packaging, the pricing Etc, and then Prosperity preservation versus Prosperity Doctrine in terms of marketing, right?
4:51
And so from presenting an opera offer to a prospect, I might say, hey, there's these two programs program.
A is the premium program program B.
Is the one that most people end up doing is they want to save a lot of money now in a typical scenario if I said that that might not be the main offer that I wanted to sell in this environment that option b is going to be the highest converter.
5:11
Because right now, the conversion And on savings and preservation is four times higher and it's twice as high as what growth and prosperity was before.
So, typically Prosperity compared to preservations, 221 in terms of response rates on advertisements, right?
That's why most people advertise that way for most of the time but when it flips it becomes 421 towards preservation compared to growth.
5:34
Okay?
So it's a huge flip and biodynamic so make sure that when you're selling you're hitting those points and when you're marketing, you're hitting those points in terms of discount, in terms.
A bargain, in terms of deals, in terms of it being a Steel Etc, because that's what the, that's what the buyer universe is going to respond to.
5:51
All right?
So that hopefully have card that piece.
Now, what people pay for now, you may have heard me say this before, but I think it's very doable.
Say again, is that people pay for you to pay attention, right?
That is what they want.
They want attention.
They want you to pay attention to them, okay?
6:06
So if I were, if I were doing live workouts, right?
Which many of you guys have transition to doing live workouts right now, it's not about the workout.
It's Her been about the workout, it's been about the attention, you give the individual now, how do you do that in a, in a remote setting?
If it were me, I would demonstrate the exercise that I needed them to do at home.
6:25
And I would do it in 10 seconds, right?
15 seconds tops.
All right, and then I would start my timer and say you guys go.
And then the rest of that minute, while the timer is going, I'd be calling people's names out.
Be like, Amy, Beth, thanks for hopping on.
You're doing, awesome.
Get a little bit lower.
Ryan Carson, thanks for being here, man.
6:41
Make sure you keep your pelvis forward.
And of tuck in, you know, Jason cook.
Keep rocking it to keep the pace up.
Don't slow down, Erica.
Hey, it's not time to eat a cookie right now, like we're in the middle of it, right?
And so the thing is, as we say that people know that someone is checking on the fact that they're there people want credit for showing up to the workout.
7:01
That's why people come to the gym.
It's a small group studio is because the trainer knows their name and knows that they're going to be expected to be there.
That is what people pay for the expectation that someone is waiting for them, right?
And the attention that they get.
While they're doing the session.
Hey guys real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
7:21
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
7:39
It's for free in exchange for your email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller, All Leads and so that you can not miss Us out on it because last time I sold out for like eight straight weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
And so how do we mimic that and remote setting that is how you have to be able to call people out by name.
7:59
Give them feedback in the remote setting in the live work out so they feel that they're going to continue value.
That is something that no app is going to be able to do right Beachbody online.
It's like 9 bucks a month, right?
Kayla.
It seems got the sweat out for 20 bucks a month, right?
They have amazing clean, beautiful workouts, right?
8:16
And you got the Peloton and whatnot.
I don't think they call people's names out.
Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure they don't personalize.
The like, Like that.
These are the, these are the competitive Advantage.
A service-based facility has and that you should use to be able to continue to get your customers engaged because then they know that you a saw that they were there be feeling they got status and credit see the the getting called out.
8:38
Everyone loves to hear their own name and then D they're still getting form Corrections, they're still getting motivated, they're still getting pushed to move through the entire workout while it's going.
All right?
So it doesn't necessarily mean you need is work out eight hours a day because I'll kill you, right?
Or eight full hours of your training work on 4, April hours of kill them to is if you see to demonstrate and then make sure that all the rest of their time and attention is put on the screen so they can call people out individually for doing a great job because right now that is what people are going to pay for it.
9:07
They're going to pay for attention, right?
That's what they want.
And so the more that you can think to yourself how could I what would I do?
What would I do in the old setting for 500 600 thousand dollars a month, right?
And of those things that I would do for that Value that I would normally charge.
9:25
How can I still provide those and structure, my business from an operational standpoint, how can I put systems in place?
So that I can do that at $200 a month or three hundred dollars a month, right?
And like, when you, when you think about it that way, you're going to be able to come out ahead because you're gonna be able to offer more than anyone else is going to be able to offer.
9:42
I'm not saying that changes get is not going to suck.
It is right.
Most people don't like change entrepreneurs.
We tend to do a change better.
If right now there's been a part of you that's been kind of excited about this because you're like, yeah, The break shit, make new things that's just you.
Everyone else is scared shitless, right?
9:58
And so, just remember that when you're when you're presenting change to your team, I talked about that yesterday like how to present those changes and then also with your customers, making sure that when you're communicating change them talking about how it's going to be more valuable than what you did before and how they're going to get a better deal and how it's discounted, right?
10:15
And so for most of our gyms, for example, when they sold hybrid, it was at $99 a week.
Alright, that's what the one-on-one attention was for now.
Most of them had a price point for group workouts, for 169 to $200 a month.
Roughly is the war is what most of our guys charge, right?
10:32
So what are we doing?
We're given the 101 remote one-on-one being the key here remote services for half the price, right?
So if you, if you just keep your membership, you're getting.
What we used to sell for $400 or $500 a month for only 1 69 or $200 a month.
10:50
And so this is where you starting to.
You have to maintain your Value discrepancy, right?
And so right now, people value things less because the dollars are worth more every dollar to people now is worth more to them and so you have to give them more for the dollar that they are spending.
All right?
11:05
So, big picture, I hope that made sense in terms of how you, how you structure your workouts, how you structure your marketing terms of the wording around the copy, the offers that you make like right now trying to sell premium, probably not going to be best, not gonna be the best call mirror with you.
Probably is unless you have super wealthy and vision of a great way to Target.
11:23
Right.
But if you're talking gen-pop, which most of us are, it's going to be free and discount offers that's it.
That's what they're going to be responsible for, at least the next six months.
Right, whether or not the, the coronavirus thing is done or not - it doesn't matter.
The buying behavior isn't going to shift that quickly after they've had this panic and fear.
11:40
All right?
So free and discount offers are going to be the way that you're gonna have to lead.
And then you have to build the monetization system behind it so that you can still make money off of it, right?
There's a zillion ways to make money off.
Free offers & discount offers All right, like I can I can name a leaven, right?
You have a free plus penalty.
11:56
You have free with deposit, your free with commitment, you have a limited free which is you have a free offer that your marketing, but then you try and upsell a better offer, right?
That's another version of for, you can do a free bribe offer which is they come in front.
You give them the program if they just sign up and become a member free today.
12:12
All of these are different ways that you can run free.
Same thing works for a discount offer.
Hey, this is our we're discounting the first month by 84% then come in.
You can still have a one time fee for enrollment or you can choose to waive.
Doesn't matter.
The thing is that if you have a as long as you have the mousetrap the monetization system behind it, these are the types of offers are going to run right now and believe it or not, people are more responsive to the free discount offers now than they ever have been before.
12:38
And as I said earlier, impressions are 60% off advertising is off Google and Facebook or lose.
Forty four billion this year in advertising because of Corona, right?
And that means forty four billion dollars advertising isn't going to get.
Mint.
Which means that everything because it's an auction-based system is half off, right?
12:57
And so if you have a monetization system behind it, and you know, how to make a discount or free offer, you know, how to monetize that, so that you can acquire customers.
You don't have to necessarily give up, you can actually get through this and structure your business in such a way that when you get out of this, on the other side, you create an operationally efficient model, more efficient, potentially more profitable, more value to Consumers, which is exactly what happens.
13:23
Recessions, the people who have the lowest value get kicked out, right?
And so it squeezes everyone else to become more efficient and more profitable.
The guys who make it through grow more than they did before the recession happened.
So you can think about, in terms of, let me be grateful for the fact that we have the opportunity to make our business better, which is how you should think about it.
13:42
Because the end of the day, like I said, Superman ain't coming, it's just us.
Alright, so anyways, hope that made sense, that is what I would do if I was doing live workouts.
That is how I change my market, which is what we're doing for our people right now.
And how I would structure the actual programs and offerings and pricing on the back end in order to get people to pay.
13:58
Now, just as much as they were before, more for the same lots of love keeping amazing.
Please drop a like or comment if you've got a valuable and I'll catch you guys on the flip side.

Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, the words are the easy part.
0:20
The thing that separates good sales.
People from Bad sales, people's how they say the words, welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer, and how to keep them longer and the Many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on, everyone?
0:39
This podcast / video is going to be more tactical in nature about selling stuff and so we are privy Jim launch to a wealth of data and so I know as an independent operator.
So if you're not in the community, you can operate on your own.
0:54
You're like, what's going on?
What's Happening?
And so, we can rapidly test things.
And so one of the Beautiful Things is now I take a call with every one of our German words every day.
So it's a daily call that I do with all of our gym.
So I can like account for things quickly.
We can test Things out.
I can find out the next day and we can move much faster to community.
1:10
And so in the last 14 days, we've been able to Triple, the average upfront Revenue per show up, or pick up on a phone call.
It's pretty big.
And so we're considering to just test out offers price points, etcetera.
And so I figured I would give you some of the findings that we have kind of discovered through that process.
1:30
First one is not about sales at all, but about scheduling so make sure that you are putting your scheduling or scheduler.
ER, whatever you have on your, thank you page where people should be opting in to book a time with you as a 15 minute increment between the actual appointment.
1:45
So if you're let's say available from 4:00 to 7:00 instead of saying 4435, it should say 4:00 4:15 4:30 4:45, 5515 etcetera.
And so, by doing that, you'll get a higher schedule and get a high percentage people to show.
And I think there's a variety of reasons for that, and I think that's mostly because actually, I'll give you a couple reason why I think that is.
2:04
And I have no idea.
So, this is my theories.
I think one, when it When you see 15 minute increments, it looks like it's more.
It's not as big of a time commitment.
So people are more willing to do it.
Someone number two, I think when you see more time slots available, you just feel like you should be able to find a time that works best for you 3.
2:20
Sometimes people have pockets of time that they're willing to give up between things.
Whereas if it's, you know, the the bigger, the blocks of time, the less able, they are to pinpoint free moments in their life, all right?
And I'm sure there's other reasons too, but there's the top ones that I've got.
2:36
So that was number one.
Facts that you should know about selling remote, Fitness of selling over the phone.
Second once you get the words, right, once you get the script right, it's going to take practice, it's going to take reps.
And so what we're seeing at Jim Lunch is once people cross that 20 sale threshold or 20, 20 at-bats, so 20 pickups on the phone, they're close rate is really going up now, it's not going from like 19 to 20.
2:59
I was something there 20th, call they like learn magic, it's just the fact that a lot of you are, you know, a lot of us Fitness Professionals in general, haven't sold over the phone, right?
You sold a lot of times in person Took you time to get good.
You might be might be doing this for five years, and never had to solve the phone, right?
And so, just imagine you're starting.
3:14
You still have the skill of sales, you to learn how to do it a new environment.
The good news is that if you have the right words, it doesn't take that long and the piece that you need to learn is tonality, right?
If you refer to Jordan, Belfort, The Wolf of Wall Street straight line sales, the words are the easy part, the thing that separates good sales people from Bad sales, people's how they say the words, right?
3:33
Two people can read a script or give a presentation and their tonality and how They enunciate things and how they raised their voice at certain types of are fair enough, right?
Rather than does that sound fair?
It sounds in the sounds jokey.
Like no one would say that.
Plenty of people talk like that.
Especially if it's their third or fourth or fifth call, it's hard for them to do that.
3:51
The next piece on the phone is energy management.
Especially you know, the guys were doing our work with us are getting you know, 10 15 calls a day that they're that they're attending.
And so you have to make call 14 just as fresh as call number two and so managing your energy and your state during that process is going to ultimately make you more money.
4:07
Now, in terms of price points and offers and things like that, what we're seeing right now is we're telling people start with 199 and we're doing a be offers.
So that means that we're closing 200 dollar tickets or rolling them into continuity.
And right now we're seeing the majority of people actually willing to roll in the continuity rather than pay The Upfront feet.
4:27
Now that being said, there's obviously guys were just Savages and just you know, they closed and they do a really good job with it, but we're seeing people are more able to more easily able to Get right into continuity.
The beautiful thing about that is that I mean think about it.
You're closing one or two people, a day straight into continuity by the end of the month.
4:44
You've got 45 60 people who are signed up in a continuity at $200 a month for a remote for 100 percent margin business, right?
Like not hundred percent, 80 percent gross margin is probably a trainer 20% to do the Fulfillment, but like big picture, not that bad, right?
So when you're getting on the phone and having to offers and that way you make it an assumed clothes, makes it much easier for Because it's not like yes or no.
5:09
It's which one do you prefer, right?
Which one is right for you and that allows you and even less skilled salespeople to close at a higher percentage.
All right?
So especially if this is your first time doing it, it's a great way to kind of lead into the sale because it also gives you down cells.
Next thing is, you have to have bullets in the holster, okay?
5:26
So for you to ethically, be able to charge a different amount.
Like let's say someone says, you know, what I can't do, forty nine dollars a week but I would do it for $39 week, you have to ask yourself.
Would you be Willing to take on a member for $169 a month, right?
For remote Services.
5:41
If the answer to that question is still yes, right.
Which for many of you probably is you need to be able to have an ethical difference between what you sold at 49 and 39.
So let me give you a couple of ones that that I like, all right, number one, and you don't have to use all of these.
You can use some of these, you can use whichever ones you want, but if you're going to peel things back, you don't really want to peel Services back because you want them to have a good experience, right?
6:03
And we know that reaching out to them on a daily basis to checking on them, make sure they do.
K is going to be a really high value thing.
You don't want to take that away because they're not going to stay, right?
It's important for you to keep a lifetime value.
And so, here's a couple other variables.
Number one, you can remove a commitment.
So, instead of saying, hey, you know, it's 49 bucks, a week to stay, stay with us at our gym instead of it being forty, nine dollars a week.
6:23
Just pure period is $49 week for 12 weeks, all right?
So they're making some commitment in order to get that discount off the 99 a week, which is what you should be selling your remote Services, generally, for which is what we've been selling, our remote services in the gym or Community since the last nine months, that's what it's been.
All right, so if you're going to give them that that half off deal, you could do it for a commitment.
6:41
So you can remove the commitment if you want to.
That's one one bullet in the holster second bullet, you can use is like, all right, it said, 49?
I'll let you go for 39, but you only made testimony about the end, right?
So boom.
So now they're doing something for you.
So, you're not taking away anything, but they have more Hoops to jump through, all right?
7:00
Next one below.
That might be okay, not only Jeff Lee meets us.
What you got to bring me a friend, all right.
Now whether or not you enforce that That is going to be up to you, but this way it gives you another ethical reasonably.
Listen, I'll drop you down to 29 but you got to bring your friend because that way, at least gets me my half off Price, Right?
Fair enough.
A most efficient quick break just to let you know.
7:19
We've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright, so send me a connection request a note.
Let me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or Layla's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
7:39
And when you say these things and you make these, the kind of negotiations is to essentially with this because his closing a deal, it's push and pull and if they feel like you are giving them a price.
And, and then asking for something in return is, that's unfair, we say that enough times, people say out to South unreasonable to keep saying, no?
7:56
Right?
And so, you should use that to your advantage when you're trying to close sales over the phone and having these these things in your holster.
So, the three easy ones that I just mentioned, one is you can waive the commitment, second is, you can ask them for A testimonials, it's an easy way to peel back the price.
The Third Way is you can tell them that they just got to give you a friend, you know, within the first four weeks or something like that.
8:15
All right?
And so there's those are three easy ones that you can use right away to help ethically, negotiate a lower price if you need to to close the sale.
All right, so there's a ton of data that we are getting on a regular basis.
Right now as a community, we're going up by about five dollars per pick up, which doesn't sound like much.
8:33
But by percentage based it's about 10% of day, which is huge if you know how percentages work.
And so it's these tiny little things that were figuring out.
Now, the guys who have been selling the most successfully have gone from 199 2299, and I want to take a brief moment to talk about that because if you can have the, if you have a Navy offer, right?
8:53
You're saying this is, this is something that we call the green play in our world for a while, but just it's an assumed close, right?
And in the book that I have coming out called building a better mousetrap, it's I have probably 30 different ways of making offers and Easing off of different front ends and one of them is called a free bribe, okay?
9:12
And free bribe, offer is very simple.
You say, hey, I've got this amazing program that we sell for five hundred dollars, right?
And so you can either get that program.
And all that stuff for $500 or you can just become a member today and get that whole, five hundred dollar value for free just becoming a member.
9:29
And so that allows you to position a really valuable thing to get someone into continuity, all right.
And so depending on your objectives or whether you want to get more cash, upfront or going to get more continuity the way that you juxtapose this to prices.
So whether you that you interplay, those two is important.
All right, so if I wanted to get 90% of people to take me on my continuity off because that was my objective.
9:49
Then what I would do is I would make that that a offer that first offer.
Hundred seven hundred thousand dollars for that first offer.
Now 1 out of 10 people might say you know what, that's what I want and it's like cool.
The nice thing though is that if you the higher up, you make that offer one, the people who do take pay you a lot of money, but more importantly you have a nice price anchor because when you present option b option, b, you'll be way cheaper because it's me, continuity play, right?
10:14
And when you go there, you'll get most people automatically do that, and they will value option b at the same value that you have.
Had option and they feel like they're getting a great deal because right now we're in recessionary spending, right?
And so everything's about deals and Bargains.
And so, you need to position your offers in such a way that people feel like they're getting a deal in order to buy, right?
10:35
And so flip side, if I wanted to get more cash upfront that I might make the two prices equivalent, right?
And so it's like, it's either 49 a week for, you know, which would be $200.
The first month or is $200 right now?
And there's no continuity, right?
It's a most people be like, well, I'll just pay the 200 and so this is how you can.
10:53
You back and forth and based on your objectives, you can cater it.
So, like if you're more cash-strapped, then you're going to probably want more cash flow.
If you are cash strapped, and all you're going to try to push everything in the continuity or like many gyms, they sell between 200 or $300 for that offer.
11:09
Now, you may be like, that sounds low, the big thing here is volume right?
Like, I believe me, I love High.
Take it, or am I take you guys love it.
The thing is, is like we got to confront reality is that we're in a different song environment.
And these people are called trafficking have been positioned at all in your Marketplace.
And so, our guys are able to sell 200 300 on the first phone, call one call close comfortably.
11:30
And so the thing is is like because leads are so cheap right now and Ellen's working the shit out of the leads.
Like we're getting a ton of people on the phone and so like, most the gyms have six pickups 10 pickups at, I mean, imagine every single day, your gym, having six to ten people walk in the door, it's the same thing just in a virtual song environment.
11:48
Everything else is the same, all the rules apply and so if you can just close two or three of those people a day, any continuity its enormous for what you're gonna be able to build.
And what's interesting is if you look at this over like a 90-day period, which I think is what we're going to be looking at going forward, I mean, how long minimum how long this we're going to be affected by.
12:04
This is Jim's because we're one of the first ones to shut down which we want to be one of the last ones to be operationalized.
In 90 days you can build a whole business.
I'm Jim's launch on 90-day timetable.
So if you if you look at our exterior which is one of the most successful launching a franchise, they have an amazing launch system.
12:21
They do a three-month launch and they require their franchisees have at least 250 sign up members before they open it.
They do not have that they cannot open right?
And so for you if you think about this in your own head and think I got 90 days to get 250 people sign up for my remote program, you may get there 90 days from now and think, huh?
12:40
I've got 250 people pay me two hundred dollars a month.
Maybe I'll just keep this business.
And I think some interesting conversations are going to happen down the road.
But anyways, I wanted to give you something as hacks that you should know about some remote Fitness.
There's a million more things that we've kind of discovered because we have the beauty of having lots and lots and lots of data and lots of gems that are testing things actively for us.
13:02
We tried half offers didn't work didn't generate the lead flow mostly for right now it's going to be around free offers and that's because that's the environment that we're selling in right now.
Now, that being said, just because someone signs up for free offers does not mean that you don't have every right.
Right to upsell them into a higher value service, right?
13:21
So upon more education, they might find out that they actually would like to pay for this other thing that's a far more irresistible offer that will that will get them their goals, right?
Because that's what they want.
They signed up because I want to lose weight.
They didn't sign up cuz they like singing opera stuff, right?
And so, as long as you remember, that that it is okay to sell stuff.
13:38
Even if you marketed something as free, as long as you have a free offer that you marketed, if you present a superior offer that that will get them, there goes better and get higher service.
They're faster and guarantee it or whatever.
Then the likely that they take it is higher and it allows you to get far lower cost of acquisition.
13:54
Farther Elite cost far, higher volume and ultimately help more people and make money during the process and come out at this thing on top.
So anyways, I hope you enjoy it.
Some of those hacks, they should know about summer Fitness.
I will make more of them as they come up.
Keep amazing.
14:10
And lots of loves everybody.
Sorry for the green screen, I'm doing some recordings over the next few days and so All right, pitches in that.









0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually a pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect, and let's rock and roll.
0:17
You've got to be able to sell over the phone.
That is the skill.
Welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer, and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Good morning, everyone.
0:34
Happy Monday.
Hope you guys are enjoying your beginning of the week.
I stood there, staring at the screen, like debating, whether or not I was going to title this one, I'm titling right now.
We'll see if it's a good or a bad idea, but I'm titling.
0:50
This as of current and maybe by the time you listen to sell of chickened out.
But we'll say, just because you watched porn, doesn't mean you can F-word.
And the reason I say that is I and I was thinking about saying just because you watch TFC doesn't mean you can fight I thought a couple different versions but I figured this would be the most incendiary version of this headline.
1:10
And so what I wanted to bring up with some observations that we have seen in Jim watch the one skill that you're going to need to get through the recessionary times in the remote setting and something that I found out from my good friend dr.
Kashi and how to how those three things all tie together into one beautiful content package for All right, so actually robbing your on here and so you were asking me the other day, which is this kind of funny that you're the first one I've done.
1:36
You were asking me, you know, I've got this much money left in my bank account.
Should I sign up for GLX, right?
How do I know I'm going to, you know, be successful.
And the answer that I gave you is the answer that I kind of want to give everyone.
And I want to kind of drill down a little bit more into that, which is you've got to be able to sell over the phone.
1:56
That is the skill, all right?
And the vast.
Majority of gym owners personal trainers, Etc, don't have that skill.
In fact, many brick-and-mortar business owners don't have that skill and they think that they can sell because they've sold in a trust and a trust-based, local setting in person.
2:12
Alright, your skill of sales has to massively level up, depending on because what you're doing, is really creating more distance in less trust, which means your skill has to overcome a wider bridge in order to close a deal, right?
You know, one step removed from in person would be Zoom Except removed from that would be a phone call one step removed from that would be a webinar, right?
2:33
So each of those creates more and more distance between your skill of sales has to overcome a larger distance in order to close the prospect.
Right?
And the reason, I titled this, just because you've watched porn a lot of times, right?
So, like some of us, you know, I mean, remember, or some of some of you may have kids, who are like 13, 14, 15, I'm sure that you're trying to cyber Patrol them and do all the stuff to make sure that they don't watch things.
2:56
You're not supposed to on the internet, but that being said, I think a lot of them Um do purely out of curiosity, right?
But the reality is that just because someone has watched something on the Internet a bunch of times does not mean they are good at the thing.
And so what I mean by that is as I'm trying to tie this to sales, okay, and so now that we have more data coming out of GLX his we can track everyone from from click all the way through sale, all right?
3:20
So we can see how many leads, how many schedule time you showed, how many sold, how much money upfront Etc.
And so what we've observed, as I said, earlier last week, it was a 10, but it's actually closer to 25.
Now that we have a bigger data set of number of sales, consults that have to be taken on the phone before people become proficient.
3:40
All right?
And this was really interesting to me because I'm sharing this with dr.
Cashews, a good friend of mine, and he's, you know, he knows tons about the research world of like Behavioral Science and, and anyways, he basically explained to me that most fears get Conquered through exposure, right?
4:00
So if you're afraid of spiders, if you're afraid of foreigners, if you're afraid of whatever right, you need to have 25 to 25, to 30 neutral, exposures to the stimulus in order for you to no longer be afraid of it, right?
And so the thing is that it was weird to me that it could almost is like there's a ton of data that backs the so he got super excited about it but that our observation from from from the GLX side is 100% backed in science.
4:28
That After you have 25 exposures, what essentially happens is, you're able to function at a normal rate, right?
So, most people are impaired basically through stress and adrenaline etcetera, when they are exposed to a new setting.
And so, for many of you, when you're trying to sell in a remote setting, you've never experienced it before.
4:47
And so, the reason I started this with this headline, like if you've watched a lot of porn, whatever you might not know how to do X, right?
Is the same thing with sales, right?
You may go through all the sales training in the World, you may have gone through Cardone.
You, you may have gone through straight line sales.
5:02
You may have gone through our sales training, right?
And they're all amazing sales trainings, but the reality is the best sales training, the world is getting in the arena.
Right?
Is getting in the octagon and getting punched in the face because that is when you'll actually learn.
You will learn more about how to fight in your first 25 fights.
5:20
Then you will off of years of training to fight, right?
And so, to the same degree when you're getting into phone sales, right?
The one thing that everyone Has to be able to learn how to do in order to be successful in the current state and potentially the projected state of the economy and the buying behavior that people are going to have in a remote setting is you've just got to get on the horse, right?
5:40
Like there's no there's no there's no way around it.
And so the way that I've been trying to position this for our community is that instead of paying five thousand dollars for sales training, what you're going to essentially be able to do is you're going to buy 25 reps, right?
5:56
That's pretty much.
What's going to happen is you're going to get in.
In 25 times and you're going to stumble your way through it until eventually you get to this point where you're like, okay, I can actually just read this script and I don't have to be stressed.
When they say something back that I'm not prepared for, right?
6:12
And so, it's 25 at-bats.
All right, is what we're seeing.
And that's, and I think that's kind of magical, because if you look at like the first, 20 hours of a new skill is where you get the disproportionate return on your time.
After that is where you have, you continue to have diminishing returns.
6:28
On your time at 20 hours.
If you think it'd be like want to learn guitar if you if you dedicate 20 hours to learning it you get significantly better than you will offer any other hours after that.
Now obviously, there's there's marginal returns to Crystal important, right there.
People who are much better at sales after thousand hours of sales, or 5,000 hours of sales, Etc.
6:46
But the first 20 hours, right?
The first one, he calls 25 to use me that we've seen is what is what is the is?
What is the break breaking point?
Our breakthrough point for people to really acquire Her the skill of sales and be able to replicate their closing in person percentages to closing over the phone.
7:05
And so the reason I think it's really important to go in with that knowledge is that I think it will lower your stress response to the new selling environment because you have to just confront it period.
There's no way around it.
You're going to have to sell over the phone in order for you to get to be able to grow during this period of time, or at least replace what you may be losing in losses.
7:25
Cancellations and freezes, right?
And so, I think For a lot of us we should always look at like okay, sure some of us got a shit sandwich and that's okay, right?
But what are we going to do with it, right?
So if by the end of this, you acquired a massively valuable skill of learning to sell over the phone because you were forced to go through and get punched in the face in the arena about your Times by the end of it.
7:47
You will be more proficient in this new way of selling which believe it or not actually gets a higher percentage of leads to show up for sales appointment which is actually kind of cool because you actually get more throughput on your aunt's bed, which is awesome.
Right.
Most Nation real quick.
8:03
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to fifteen hundred dollars.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
8:23
So anyways, I bring all this up to say, you're going to suck in the beginning, you have to embrace the suck, right?
And the thing is, if you're going to keep sucking, and then you're going to suck a little bit less, and then one day, you'll wake up and actually be good, right?
And people are going to ask you but man, how did you get good at sales over the phone and you're gonna be like, I just started doing it, right?
8:43
And so, if you can position this, in your mind is not like, oh my God.
And create a traumatic experience for yourself by being like, Oh my God.
I went over 54.
My first five sales.
It's okay.
You're To have to eat that for a second before you get good in.
There's nothing that you can do to short cut that, right?
8:59
It's like the person who's like, I watched a bunch of squat videos.
I'm going to be able to to to hit a barbell, you know, Max W.
The first time you step up it's not realistic, right?
It's not even realistic by any stretch of the imagination and so if you can, if you can, if you can really internalize that if you're the one who's taking the sales but more so also for if you if you eventually get to a point where you're Outsourcing the sales to someone else, you have to understand that.
9:22
That especially if they haven't sold in this environment, it's going to take some Reps for them to adjust, right?
Even if they are experienced in sales before, even if they sold it, your facility before in person, it's going to take them 25 reps. 25 neutral, exposures, and he, and Trevor doctor has kind of like explain this.
9:41
To me is like, if they have negative experiences, he's like it prolongs.
So neutral exposures where they don't have something catastrophic happened them for you.
So that's why it's really important to just like regulate your emotions when you're taking this and say I'm going to put my 25 Min and what it does is it allows you to lower your pressure so that you can actually I think have more mental Clarity going into the sale and potentially shortened, right.
10:06
But just knowing that we setting expectations of like, I'm going to acquire the skill of learning to sell over the phone.
And the best way to learn to acquire the skills.
Not to watch more and more trainings, but to just get in and do it.
And accept the fact that I'm going to suck before I get good.
And that is how it works, right?
10:22
These things will help.
Help you prepare the scripts the recordings cetera but nothing everything will pale in comparison to you getting on the phone and having the conviction that you have done this before.
And so just like that you will look at someone who's new and says they've struggled on their first seven calls and like to finally close one out of seven, right?
10:39
And it was only on like a fifty dollar down.
Like I couldn't, you know, I'm like I'm not going to be able to make through and then you can look at them with conviction, be like, dude, just get more reps in like just get more reps in and you're going to be okay.
All right.
So the seal sweet spot was was 25 to 30.
And that matches up with exposure training for how you can you know get through something.
10:57
An interesting tidbit was that doctor guys?
Now we're talking about this a lot this weekend and what happens is once you learn a core skill, right?
Is it the remainder of your skills are what's called distraction training, right?
If you train a dog and you teach you how to sit right after you've taught it, how to sit, it's then teaching.
11:15
How to sit when someone new comes in the door, you teach him how to sit when it's loud and there's music.
You teach them how to sit when There's food that just got port and they can't, they can't go get the food.
They have to keep sitting, right?
Those are all different scenarios that are being, that that dog is being exposed to do the same thing, right?
11:34
If you're in a basketball game, right?
Everyone wishes.
They could play like they do in practice, right?
And so essentially all you know, exposure plane training or distraction training is, is how can I increase the stressful, stimuli around you and then still get you to ignore that and execute the training that you already know how to You right?
11:54
And so this functions in a lot of ways that the same way is that is, this is basic distraction training, is that we're putting you in the real world.
Setting, were you over time or able to execute the skill?
You already know you have but in a stressful environment, right?
And I know a lot of you like I need to make these sales.
12:10
I have to make these sales and I know that like that you can come into that with that but I would urge you to think I have to serve this person.
This person really needs my help, and in order for me to help them, I have to help them make decisions and following the This script is the most proven way of doing that, right?
12:26
And so, having run a lot of sales teams large group teams.
But the biggest thing that can get people to lose sales, is when they start getting cute, they start being cute.
They start trying to start, start trying to innovate the script to start thinking, they're going to.
That's a beat the algorithm.
You know what I mean?
It's like, you're not going to beat the algorithm.
12:42
You're not going to be the special snowflake, right?
You're just going to put the Reps in and you're going to read the words on the script that have already been tested.
And that is how you're going to win, right?
And your skill over the next 25 sales is Learn how to say the words properly, right?
Is to learn how to say the words with the right inflection and tonality at the right times in response to what they are saying and lead them down this in sequence.
13:03
So that they come to the Natural conclusion that they should work for you or with you.
And that is how you get the skill of sale, which in my opinion, is the first step of being a good coach is that you have to sell someone the possibility that they can accomplish what they want, right?
And so I'll leave you with a final tidbit.
13:18
That's been a big, big boost to the average closing.
Of whole gym, words Community has been.
We are essentially assuming the sale.
So we're not even, we're really just like cool.
Let's get you started.
And let's start setting up the next appointments rather than asking if they're in, right?
13:35
And so simply by and Sound small right?
But it's always these the small D, small tweaks, the small hinges that open big doors that are getting bigger bigger paid and fools and painful right now, over the phone or remote setting is 299.
So that's what that's what we're targeting.
All of our gyms at is 299 for that front end For and that's up front cash flow and it's working pretty well.
13:56
So when you're doing that and the leads are as cheap as they are, which they still are cheap right now they're not two weeks ago.
Cheap two weeks ago, cheap was stupid right now is regular cheap, it's seen levels cheap.
You know, we're talking, you know, five, ten dollar leads not like 50 Cent, 22 dollar leaves, which is what it was, 14 days ago.
14:15
So it's coming somewhat back to normal, which is somewhat good because then it becomes more reliable and predictable but anywho You can use that headline if you're tried to train your sales team.
And if you wanted to use a less incendiary headline, you can use the fighting analogy of like, hey, just because you've watched sorry, just because you've watched the UFC, doesn't mean you can fight, and the same degree, just because you've watched, Kobe played doesn't mean that you're going to be able to win the NBA, right?
14:40
It takes practice to takes reps and if you can, if you can position in your mind that the Reps that you're putting in and the cost of acquiring these, these repetitions is the most valuable way is the fastest As viable way for you to actually learn the skill of sales, not by, you know, Cardone.
14:57
You or I don't like, don't be wrong.
I think those are all great trainings.
I've gone through them like, they're very good, but this will still, like, not, not even close in comparison will help you learn how to sell.
All right, is actually selling.
So, anyways, hope you guys have an amazing Monday, hope you set your expectations properly so that you can get through this and Crush.
15:17
I can tell you this, I've got, I got 15 testimonials of for the weekend from Guys, that were over 75 percent, close rate on their phone calls, so it is possible.
You can do it, you just got to get good at it.
Alright, it's gonna be the one skill that's gonna be able to get you through it because you're going to be able to downsell and keep people who are in your existing customer base and also sell new customers so that they can stay on with you and you can refill the pipe.
15:41
All right.
So anyways, hope you guys are loving life and excited about the opportunity that we all get to have, which is to learning skills in a new environment.
I'll catch you soon.
All right.
Like and love and And heart and comment, and Tack and all that good stuff.
Found it valuable or don't if you did, that's all about.









0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else when you spend money on marketing, Can you make more money than you think you do, right?
You just collected other vehicles?
Welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
0:43
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Good morning everyone.
Happy Friday.
Hope you guys are having a fantastic friday, end of your week, but let's be real weeks, don't exist anymore.
And so I wanted to make something a little bit, different less covid related actually about business.
1:00
What a concept and so I want to talk about why business owners beat gym owners.
And so, the only way that you can survive as a gym owners to transition from being a gym owner to a business owner.
And I thought there's one thing that kind of started this sort of the stock process and then I want to tell you a story that I think will really drive it home.
1:17
So we have some pretty, you know, sweet marketing tools that we pay thousands of dollars a month for for attribution tracking.
And so that means is we can follow a click from a click on a website to a post, to something else to two pages and then they end up opting in and then whether they buy and we can see that over a six-month period, right?
1:37
And so we can see a buyer journey and basically, after looking at all of the data that we have access to, I have one simple conclusion from that which is whenever you Our kit.
You make a lot more money than you think you do, and it's because there's all of these secondary and tertiary and results that start like the secondary Ripple effects that happen from your marketing.
1:59
And so in the beginning, your marketing and you're just trying to convert through whatever offer you have and that's your direct attribution and usually have a decent, most businesses have a decent level of attribution there.
Now I was talking to a group of entrepreneurs and one of them has a cream company and they were selling about 330 million a year and He was looking to be acquired by a company that's doing a billion dollars a year in cream sales.
2:21
He said, the one difference that I saw between my company and their company is that they were able to better attribute, how much money they were making across all of their marketing.
He said, and there were channels where they were losing money on their marketing, but net across all of the other channels were recouping there at expenses now, I say that as just kind of preface to the the next story, which is so my takeaway from all of that stuff in the knowledge that we have.
2:47
Is that when you spend money on marketing, you make more money than you think you do, right?
You just collected, other vehicles.
And so that leads me to kind of an example story.
I was going to break down all the math and then my VP said you should just tell the story and not include the math part.
And so, what I wanted to say is this the reason that business owners beat gym owners, and the reason that the biggest Fitness companies in the world are not owned by Fitness professionals is because Fitness professionals don't think like business professionals, all right.
3:12
And so here's a decision that I see made over and over and over again.
That is is You money and is the reason that you're not growing.
All right, so Jim watch Drew and has grown to be the biggest player in the space to my knowledge.
Not because of, I mean, while because of lots of things, but one of them is because I'm willing to go into a loss to acquire a customer, because I understand what the lifetime value of a gym owner is for us.
3:38
And so there was a point I would say probably six months ago, maybe nine months ago where we were net negative for three months on the acquisition of a Mer before turning our first dollar profit and because of that, when I talk to other people who are in the space, they're like, how do you acquire so many gems?
3:55
Like you're doing five times, ten times as many gyms as we are?
And they even tell me their cost of acquisition and believe it or not, their cost of acquisition is cheaper than mine is, right?
It's a lot of people think that, you know, we're amazing marketers and all that stuff and I would actually don't think we are.
I think we're just good at making business decisions.
4:12
And so what I want to do is relate that in layman's terms to a story that I think makes sense.
So if Our to tell you or a fitness professionals.
We're not you somebody, you know, right?
Hey, give me a dollar and I'll give you a dollar back tomorrow, right?
4:29
Some of them would be like, okay, or said or give me a dollar and I'll give you a dollar and 25 cents back in seven days or give me a dollar and I'll give you two dollars back in 30 days or give me a dollar and I'll give you five dollars back in 60 days, or Or I'll give you give me a dollar and I'll give you $10 back in six months, right?
4:54
But you can only get one of them and so that's, that's, that's point one.
So you can only pick one of those one of those things.
Right.
And here's here's the kicker.
If you choose the six-month one, I will let you to put as I'll let you put 200,000 dollars and give me two hundred thousand dollars and I'll give you two million back for option b for the The to do one or whatever.
5:19
For date day 30 you can only give me ten thousand dollars right for the 60 day one, which was 421.
You can only give me fifty thousand dollars, right?
And so what you're seeing here is now think about that trade.
5:35
Now maybe I give you too many options.
Let's just say, day one is one to one day at day, 30 or two to one day, 60 or 4 to 1 and day day.
You know, six month here at 8:20, right?
We'll just use those because it's simple, right?
If you have that, Example.
Most of you hopefully would say I would give you as much the the highest amount that I could, that I could put money into.
5:56
So probably the six-month one where you can give me 10 to 1 back in six months, right?
That seems like an obvious choice.
The problem is Most gym owners don't make that decision when they're running their actual business.
And so, the reason Jumanji exploded was also because we found a way to make people money for 21 in their first 24 hours.
6:20
Right.
And it allowed people who weren't business owners to make money like business owners, do being super transparently, right?
That's what it was right?
And right now we're on the precipice of.
So another one of these opportunities that's coming up with remote which is amazing and I'm thinking about how to best play these cards myself because it's pretty exciting.
6:41
But in this scenario let's say like I don't want to add too many variables to this, but let's say the the new service that we're selling has an 80% or 90% margin to it.
Whoo.
So actually making more money on the back end but here's the kicker.
6:57
You give a dollar today.
I give you 50 Cent's back tomorrow.
I give you a, you give me a dollar today.
I give you a dollar back in 14 days.
Give me a dollar a day and I give you a dollar back in 30 days, but from that point, Point going forward.
7:12
You continue to make all profit after the purchase right of this dollar exchange, right?
That's kind of what remote is looking like right now is a fucking cash.
Cow on the back end and it's understanding what the lifetime value is and lifetime value.
7:30
Here's the big thing that everyone needs to understand across the fitness industry.
The rules of how you ran your gym with the metrics fundamentally change because the margin of the service that you're providing is not the same.
Right?
An in-person brick and mortar business runs significantly, lower margins than a remote only service, right?
7:49
Hugely different.
The reason that most homeowners can't have to make as much money on the front end typically is because they only make 12 25 percent on the back end in terms of of the of how much revenues were brought in.
So, let me make this real for you.
8:05
If you had a client that the LTV was a thousand dollars, right?
So you're building a hundred dollars a month, ten percent turn is a thousand dollars.
Okay, now if you're making a 25 percent margin right and you want to do it off, gross margin, right.
Let's say, so you making $250 for you to take home after that, after that person has been serviced at cetera, right?
8:28
And so you're only putting 250 dollars in your pocket, which is why so many gems loved making five or six hundred dollars up front because they actually Subconsciously realize they made less money, right?
Doing it.
The other way.
The difference is now in a remote setting.
If you have 1,000 are lltv you're taking home, 800 of that, right?
8:47
It's much different because you don't have all of these ancillary costs that are associated with running a brick-and-mortar in person business, right?
You don't have the toilet paper, you don't have that the the rent, right?
You don't have the front desk person.
You have to always staff there.
You don't have.
There's all of these little costs and if you're not sure about they are just look at your bank statement.
9:03
Like you'll see right that They're in a remote setting, which is why so many people want to go online.
The difficulty is acquisition, right?
But if acquisition is taken care of, because it is right now, because people are very, very comfortable buying online right now because they have to everyone is learning to buy online.
The entire buying ecosystem is fundamentally no for our best interests as a community, right?
9:24
They're allowing us to go into a high profit margin service.
It's fucking awesome.
All right, so if you have the frown turn it upside down because right now is when it's hot and I'm think I'm I'm really thinking about how to structure this thing to best to best crush this, for the whole, the whole industry.
9:39
And for us too.
I'm thinking about how I can hire train your so we can do the filming some seeing the numbers, and it's awesome.
All right, and it's understanding are you willing to put a dollar in today and then make $1 back in 30 days?
9:55
Knowing that, that thing will become a 200 dollar month Profit Stream, every month thereafter.
That is the decision that most people are not willing to make, and that is why gym owners do not beat business owners.
Hey guys, real quick.
10:10
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I catch the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
10:40
Because they do not know how to do math or they do and then still don't make decisions based on math.
It's the only difference, right?
The guys who I know, who owned the business, biggest businesses take, massive losses in the acquisition so that they can acquire more customers.
So I'm going to give you a different example of this.
10:57
If I said, I'm only constrained by breaking even on day.
One day, one of my ad spend, I may be able to acquire 10 customers per month.
All right, now if I know my churn is 10%, then I means that my company can grow to 100 clients a month, and it will never grow after that.
11:14
Because I'm only bringing in 10 and I'm losing 10% of 100, which is 10.
All right, so it evens out, I bring in town, I lose 10, upbringing 10, I lose 10 and it will not grow past that.
Okay?
And that's because I put a constraint on how he's doing.
Our customers, which is, I have to break even day one.
11:30
Now, if I said, I have to break even by day 30, I could probably sell three times as many customers.
Just from that one switch of going from Breakeven day one to Break Even day 30.
So what that means is, instead of having 10 new customers a month, I could sell 30, new customers month.
11:48
If my turn Remains the Same of 10%, then my company goes from 100 Max to 300 Max.
So simply by by shifting, when you're willing to break even on the customer, you can make three times more money.
Simply by Shifting, the break-even point from day 1 to day 30, all right.
12:07
Now if you wanted to be an absolute fucking bad ass and you're like, I want to take over the industry because that's who I am.
Then you would say.
Maybe I shift my dollar, my dollar flag over today, 60, right?
That's where I'm willing to break, even and then I look at my acquisition in think, holy shit, I can actually acquire 60 clients a month or maybe more realistically.
12:27
Shift it to that extreme.
It may be not just a 2X increase, but it may be a 5x increase.
I may be able to acquire 150 clients a month.
If I'm willing to wait, 60 days to recoup my initial investment.
Now, if you think about this, in terms of, in terms of investment opportunities, like what investment opportunity can you break even in 60 days on none except for marketing, right?
12:47
And you've built a mousetrap around it.
That is how one of the best ways to create wealth is by owning a business right now, this and fundamentally.
What is the stock market?
It's buying and selling businesses.
So what it is, it's just small pieces of it but the fundamentals work the same way.
All right, so if I now have this new company where I'm willing to spend for 60 days, I'm willing to lose a dollar.
13:08
And then 60 days later make my fruit my dollar back, right?
Take 60 days.
And the reason that I would be able to acquire that many more customers is that typically in any Market you have your red-hot buyers, you have your people who are most interested, right?
And then you have warmer audiences and then you have colder audiences.
13:25
And so what this does is if you're willing to break, Even at 60, 60, you can actually go after a much wider slice of the market and it may cost you more to reach these people or to convert these people.
But the bucket is enormous, you're talking 10 times, the size 20 times, 50 times, the size of the market, you can go after.
13:43
All right?
And so, what that means is, now I've got 150 clients a month that I can that, I'm bringing on now, that may sound unrealistic to some of you.
We've got guys right now who are selling 66 every two weeks into remote.
All right, 66 every two weeks, that's one person I'm thinking.
Man, I'm pretty good at operations, I'll bet you I could do more than that, right?
14:01
And so that person is already on Pace for doing 130 new remote clients in 30 days.
All right, so if my turn is 10%, that means that I could grow.
My remote business to 1500 clients a month.
All right, at 200 300 month.
Now we're talking two to three million dollars a year, all in a high profit margin service, that isn't geographically constrained, the opportunity becomes far more interesting.
14:29
Okay?
So to pull to pull this all back, the big takeaways that if I can if I can give them to you, your ability to win will be on your ability to make decisions with math and not emotions right now for you to be able to break even in 30 days.
14:45
On a customer, is already happening pretty much across Bored.
All right, but if you're willing to just make decisions that way and the beautiful thing is that the economy's already structured like that you can get a credit card that you put the card down.
You pay for all your acquisition cost, 30 days later, you'll recoup, the money, you pay it off and then everything you have is a result of spending that money.
15:01
The customers and them the excess cash you need is yours.
That's yours.
Someone lent you the money 10 grand for 30 days and then you brought in off of ten thousand dollars. 100 customers.
Fantastic.
And so then you pay off your acquisition cost to ten thousand dollars, right?
15:17
Right.
So, let's see.
You made a hundred dollars on each of them after everything is considered, right?
So you pay that off.
And now you have 100 customers and then the next month, you get 20 grand.
Right?
Except no one thinks that way.
No one makes those decisions.
And so if you want to win in this world right now, you have to think like a business owner, not like a gym owner, all right?
15:35
Because the business owners or going to see right now they're salivating.
I'm salivating at the opportunity.
That's existing a massive amount of the marketplace is now 100%.
Trying to go into a high profit Revenue Service model and they're willing to buy in a way.
They've never bought before.
And you're no longer geographically constrained.
15:53
It's awesome.
And so if you can make your decision like that and just think I'm willing to give you a dollar a day and then make the dollar back in 30 or make the dollar back in 60, you will be able to far outpace everyone else in your Marketplace and ultimately grow, much bigger business and have a bigger impact, as I think most of us wanted to do.
16:12
But all of that will come down to your ability to make a logical decision, instead of an emotional one.
And looking at how much does it cost to our customer?
What's my lifetime value?
And right now, we had our first, our first groups of Jim started doing.
They're halfway appointments and they're closing over 75% of those people in the continuity.
16:29
And so what that means to me is the metrics of the game are the same.
Except now all of the service on the back end is extremely high margin and requires very little upkeep.
All right.
So anyways I get very excited about this.
Hope yours is That is I am about it.
Make decisions like a business owner, be the one who wins because you make math decision set of instead of feeling decisions, wait, 30 days if you have to, to break, even wait 60 days if you have to break, even use OPM.
16:54
Use a credit card that you can to acquire the customers and inquire to 35 times the volume.
So that you can actually make the absolute margin.
That's even bigger in the business.
Okay?
So the one story that I didn't tell you, is this If you're the guy who says I have to break even day one, right?
17:10
If you were that person, and that's okay, that's fine.
And you are limited to 10, new customers a month.
Alright, that's what you're limited to.
You will have costed associate with business and some of those costs will be fixed.
Which means that guide will always make only enough to cover his costs and maybe a little bit more.
17:27
But if you were willing to wait 30 days or wait 60 days, all of a sudden you have a 300 client business or a 500 or 1000 clients.
I'm business.
And now, even though your relative return was lower, your absolute return, expands by 5 X 10 X over that period of time.
17:46
And now you're not just making just enough money to get by, but you have all of the extra, the excess that comes because your fixed costs are covered and the remainder of your costs are variable cost which means that you always are making this thing fixed marginal all the rest of your money, all right?
18:01
The first five thousand dollars, most of us make every month is not money.
We get to keep, that's money.
We Pages to run a business, but that the last ten thousand dollars you make on top of whatever it is, is typically all profit most of the time, right?
And so right now, if you have a fixed, a variable cost that goes up as you scale, the more money you make, the the lower the percentage of your total revenue, your fixed cost becomes okay.
18:28
If my fixed cost is 5 and I make a hundred grand by fixed cost is five percent of my income.
Alright, so my margin expands as I make more money.
If my if I'm only making twenty thousand dollars a month total my five thousand dollars is 25%.
18:43
So it's 5 times greater by proportion to my Revenue because I was not willing to spend 30 days to recruit my initial investment in acquisition.
All right?
So anyways, guys, the opportunity right now is enormous, we can expand far beyond our Marketplace.
We are no longer limited by the square footage.
19:00
We're no longer limited by by packed class times, like we're no longer limited by so many things right now in the Knee is and the thing is it's going to finish.
It will there's me tons of people in a flood in the marketplace price.
There's going to be press conference gonna start driving the prices down but right now people are willing to spend two to three hundred dollars a month, have a one-on-one coach and the business model that accompanies that is significantly higher margin that was before.
19:23
So anyways make the smart decision.
Make the business owner decision and when and come out of this way on top, you can do it.
We can help lots of love.
Keeping Amazing by the way.
G Alexis 41% of leads are showing up for sales calls.
It's like one out of two leads is getting pitched.
A fucking insane is that I'm super pumped.
19:40
Anyways, I've so many more data points.
I'll probably share them with you next week.
Keeping amazing.
Alright, catch you soon, bye. one out of two leads is getting pitched.
A fucking insane is that I'm super pumped.
Anyways, I've so many more data points.
I'll probably share them with you next week.
Keeping amazing.
Alright, catch you soon, bye.

Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
0:18
When they let us go back to business and open our doors.
You're going to open your doors and I think a lot a lot fewer.
People are going to come back and you think welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
We talk about how to get more customers.
Stammers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
0:36
I hope you enjoy and subscribe, good morning everyone, everyone day.
Hope you guys are good restful weekend or maybe not.
Hope you were not resting it on just selling tons of people in remote Fitness over the weekend and hopefully you were but if you were not, then this message is for you.
So I'm calling this, the oh shit, moment, I was having a conversation with a friend of mine who's in the same space is us.
0:57
And he was talking to me about some of the beliefs That he's getting over the phone with some of the gym owners that he's talking to etcetera and it was kind of interesting because he was saying that, you know, these things change week to week, but he said right now everyone's in denial phase.
1:13
You said right now they're in the phase of.
I'm going to I'm going to hold out.
I think I can wait a couple more weeks for this to be over and I guess I'm here to say that I don't think that's going to work out for you.
And here's here's why I don't think sitting and waiting is going.
1:29
To work out for you and hoping that when you open your gym, it's going to work out.
I'm calling this the oh shit moment.
Because right now, I think that there's still a certain sense of hope, right?
I think that when they turn the lights back on when they turn the economy back on, when they let Jim's back, which by the way, will be last.
1:48
But when they let us go back to business and open our doors.
You're going to open your doors and I think a lot a lot fewer people are going to come back and you think and I think that what's going to happen is going to be a slower Everything, most people anticipate because people are still weary Etc.
2:05
And I think some people will just like, always like, there's a reason.
The on-demand economy is the on-demand economy, right?
Everyone thought that people, I was really so funny.
I had an Internet troll yesterday or two days ago who commented on it had and literally just saying stupid things like stupid, like trying to be smart but saying stupid things and he was like as soon as online fitness as soon as the gyms will back up all the song like this stuff is going to go away and I was like really you think that people are just going to choose a less convenient option after they come back?
2:36
He's like well people really value the in person you know blah blah blah right.
People said the exact same thing about Blockbuster against Netflix.
They're like the CEOs of Blockbuster because it's so easy to rationalize our like human beings.
2:54
Don't want to think of Bad Case scenarios.
And so we rationalize that we don't need to change, right?
And so blah.
Buster Executives when they're like, hey, are you concerned about this online streaming stuff?
They were like, no people always value making a night, making an evening going and picking up, you know, picking out their movie walking inside and getting their candy, like, it's become an experience.
3:15
And so we think that people will continue to Value this experience, guess what?
They were fucking wrong.
People would rather just click on the couch and do nothing.
Right?
Is the experience of being at your couch better than the experience of shopping at Blockbuster?
I would say no, I really We miss Blockbuster, a lot of times but I didn't miss enough to not use Netflix or use Netflix way more.
3:34
Right?
And so the reality is that people always choose their convenience.
And I think what happened very like recently or currently right now is that a huge piece of the marketplace that never otherwise would have tried online training or maybe would have in the next decade.
3:50
It took all of the remote services and drive drag to 10 years into the future in terms of mass adoption, it was forced to adoption.
All right?
And so I think a large percentage of people We're going to say a larger than most homeowners anticipate are going to stay in a remote setting, right?
4:05
I think a lot of people are still like their jobs.
Here's the others.
Oh, shit moment.
Is that people's some of the companies that did layoffs, may not rehire, everyone, right?
Because the demand is not going to be what it was at the single greatest moment in economic history.
You mean like the best economy ever that happened before this?
4:21
And so just like the, oh shit moment is going to be when you turn the lights on and people don't show up right which Currently will be great for me because I'm just going to Mark the shit out of the gym set.
Want to work with us because like that will be when marketing is more important than ever because you're going to have to differentiate and get your name out there more than anyone else is right.
4:41
But let's rewind the clock real quick.
What do you need to do now, right?
What do you need to do now?
Because the Airship moment will come.
Now, some people have stronger communities than others, right?
And I always want to put my disclaimer for good operators, right?
If you're an amazing operator, you haven't lost anyone.
Then you'll probably recover better than people who have lost people, right?
4:58
Because you have a stronger Community more broadly, Coaches, you better culture, Etc?
Right but what should you do now?
So it is my belief and just looking at the math.
I'm going to do this big presentation for Jim Lawrence.
Don't worry.
I did a huge statistical model.
Looking at the difference between Roi on remote versus Roi in person and the question is whether or not you want to be a business owner or a gym owner and that's a very real question, like super super.
5:24
Oh, that's a personal question, right?
But if you're in this to maximize making money because I've had tons of Jim's who flew out during our VIP days and said, Alex, I want to make a million dollars a year and I said it's not going to happen in one gym right now.
Talking Heads of gurus would be like you can totally like show me the fucking bank statement, all right?
5:42
And then I'll and then I'll believe you, right?
But no I like it's not from one facility.
Unless you have a massive, massive facility and typically Group, Training personal, training, set, will be only a piece of a part of that, right?
Like, if you have 6,000 members, paying $100 a month lifetime, then sure you can make a million dollars here, right?
5:59
But most people Invest five million dollars into their build out.
Right?
So it's understanding relative scope.
Okay, so in my belief there is no way better than right now to for the best operators to be able to build a million-dollar income business to 34 million dollar Top Line business because one, we're marketing, a 25-mile radius and seeing 0 decrease in sales percentages.
6:24
All right.
Summer one number to our remote.
Jim's right now, are closing a higher percentage of Of less than they did in person.
That's a function of one.
Major thing is that they're getting 40% their leads on to it into a sales conversation compared to 20%, you know, whatever they were doing before.
6:41
All right, so they have twice as many at-bats and so even if they're not as good on the phone, they're not twice as bad over the phone, right?
And so they're a little if you look at right now, the average closing percentage of 29 percent.
So they're closing 29 percent over the phone, they were closing 42% in person.
All right, but if you get twice as many at-bats, you actually still net more sales and so So number one, you can have a bigger Geographic, ready.
7:02
So, the many people that I've talked to us is like, I want to have a bigger impact.
Here's how you have a bigger impact, you can go remote and how people are not in your neighborhood.
Number two lead costs are cheaper, not because of the ads, the ad Impressions and stuff, because that's temporary right.
We've already seen it, go back to normal.
7:18
So the at the cost per impression is has gone 100% back to more normal since two or three weeks ago.
Alright, people are advertising again.
But it's because when you draw from bigger radius, you get cheaper leads, that's just period.
If you run a an ad nationally, it's this is like challenge or whatever you'll get, you know, 25-cent leads the issue is, how do you create trust?
7:39
How do you create a sale or trustworthy environment for a lead to opt in and then buy something on the first phone call?
Right?
And that's where having I would consider like the semi local appeal automatically gives you gives you one or two trust points in your direction which is allowing us to Make sales in these first calls.
7:57
But if we're looking at it purely from a math perspective, which I would urge you to be a business owner, not a gym owner for the moment right now, our guys are essentially breaking even on the first transaction right now.
They're used to making 2 1 3 2 1 4 2 1 etcetera on the first transaction, right.
8:13
But you're limited by your Your Capacity to fulfill in terms of how many people you can have.
It each time you're limited by your lead flow because let's be real like lead flow of a 25-mile radius.
This is always going to be higher in cheaper than in as five-mile radius because it's quadratic, right?
8:30
So if you have a five mile radius and then you go from 5 to 10, you didn't double the amount of people that you saw, you pied it, right?
So 3.14, whatever the math is, but it's basically, like, let me put in layman's terms.
If you have a 12-inch pizza and have a 24 inch pizza, a 24 inch pizza is not twice as big as 12-inch be.
8:45
So you fit like for 12 inch pieces inside of a 24 inch piece because that's how circles work with with, with called quadratic expansion.
But anyways, Hey, if you're a return listener and you have not rated or reviewed the show, I want you to know that you should feel absolutely terrible about yourself and everything else in the world getting but it would mean the absolute world to me.
9:05
If you guys would go ahead and do that, you don't have to pause a show, you keep listening and you can just do it with your thumb right now will take you less than 60 seconds.
And like I said, the only way that podcast arose through word of mouth and this is you joining hands with me and helping as many isomers with possibly can because no one is coming to save us, it's just us.
All right, so please go do that now then let's get back to the show.
9:27
And so when you go to a 25-mile radius you're talking 10 times you know I mean the amount of people that you would be reaching otherwise or 20 or 50 whatever the math is and so because of that you can have a much bigger, reach, help, more people can like, anybody who's ever served with lead flow that doesn't have to happen anymore.
9:44
Like, you don't have to struggle with lead flow anymore because it's literally enormous and you pretty much can always get lead flow if your target is big enough.
All right, and so putting all these things together, cheaper leads bigger, Geographic, radius Assistant lead generation a consistent 11% of Leeds close which is what we're seeing right now which is higher than most people do in person breaking even on the front end and having 80 percent gross margin on the back end like you're talking about spending you know right now if you spend $1500 will make six thousand dollars in front in Revenue in 30 days.
10:15
That's what the math is, right?
That's the average.
All right, that's the average.
Okay.
Fifteen hundred dollars at 6600 is the actual number of upfront cash in the first 30 days for an Online business.
You know, many people have tried to start an online business, do any online business gurus there are and the reason they don't have an agency set up or whatever is because they can't guarantee an outcome, right.
10:36
They only tow the one or two testimonials that they have of the hundreds of students, they have, all right?
I'm giving you the average numbers average average for online.
So if you wanted to make a six-figure income, all right, we take you 30 days to build a recurring Revenue stream if you spent If you spent fifteen hundred dollars, it would take you spend $1500, you close to Thirty, thirty nine percent.
11:01
So let's just bump it to make a conservative.
So let you spent twenty two hundred dollars in ad spend over the first 30 days.
You'd be able to have 50 people in your online remote business.
After you lost 44% for not going into continuity.
All right, so I'm accounting for that that you only convert 60% into continuity at 200 bucks a month.
11:20
All right, that's a ten thousand dollar month business remote, you can do it in 30 days.
Like averages, if your average you can do it in 30 days right now.
And so, the big question that you have to ask is one, am I holding out for what's going to happen that I don't know about because you don't know what's going to.
11:37
I don't either that's just my guess.
But like you don't know what's gonna happen.
But what I can tell you is the opportunity is there.
And so in the next 30 days in the next 60 days, if you wanted to build yourself a six-figure or multi six-figure online income, you could do it.
I know that a lot of my jewelry won't do that.
11:53
They're going to go back to the gym and that's fine.
I'm here to I'm here to provide whatever value the community that I have asked for.
But if I were to enterprising motherfucker, which I am, I would be strongly, considering this, it has been very difficult for me to not throw my hat back in the ring and start selling Fitness at large.
12:09
Because when I see those types of numbers in terms of acquisition I was like hmm.
How many sales guys we got?
I was like I wonder if I was like I wonder if there's a bunch of gym owners who went out of business, so I could just hire him sales people because when I see that kind of stuff.
Three, two, one, four, two, one up front, You know what I mean, 10 to 1 at 30 days 10 to 1 at 60 days, 60 days.
12:31
Like in gym launch, I lose money, the first 30 to 60 days, right?
And like I've just, I just know the math game, right?
I just willing to make decisions with math.
If you are able to make decisions with math right now, and not let your emotions and not let your fear and not, let your discomfort around learning a new skill, which is selling over the phone because the only thing you have to do, that's it.
12:49
As long as you acquire that skill set, which by the way, will set you up better for when you get back to the gym.
Because if you can sell over the phone, you convert a high percentage of It's always right.
If you can just learn that skill, you can have an online business.
Suppose that right now and I hope and I think my hunch is that that buying Behavior will not change.
13:10
People will be.
Now the mass Market has been introduced to what online training is like, most people even know what it was.
Now they know what it is.
All right?
And so that that like your underestimate, how big of a deal it is for them to even recognize that industry, all right?
And so one people will now know what online training is number two, they will be comfortable, more comfortable, buying a remote setting here State over the phone, Yeah, this is after the lights, get turned back on because you're like, well, I don't want to change things, you know, temporarily.
13:36
Because something, you know, when what happens we go later.
What if you have a business that just cash flows later and then you have your gym because many people like I won't even get into it, but over the phone you just say yeah you know when covid happened we started doing our first consult over the phone and it ended up just be more convenient for people so we just stuck with it.
13:51
Anyways, so what's your name?
Why'd you click on the ad, right?
Like you can just preface the sale and that everything else flows like normal, right?
Because this has given us, the biggest reason of all time.
The biggest, why am I remote?
Why are you doing this over the phone?
Why are we doing this online?
It has.
Now given everyone permission to have that reason that we never had before, right?
14:11
And educated, like thank you to the government.
For educating all consumers on online and remote setting Fitness, right?
Thank you to the news, thank you to everybody for helping us out.
Alright?
So I say all this to say, I think that for everyone who's holding out and waiting, I don't think that's a smart decision.
14:30
I don't want to be right.
I think I probably Will be, I think a lot of people in turn the lights back on and a lot of people are gonna come back, right?
Think of this, like a vacation.
It's like all these people are like, you know what, actually I'm going to keep doing things at home or, you know, it's actually kind of more convenient for me to just kind of do it on my own schedule as if having to go there, come back shower.
14:46
All that stuff, it was just kind of easier for me because convenience and speed always win with humans, always, you have to always bet on convenience because we are lazy, right?
And especially when it comes to Fitness, all right?
And so it's like well that's why That's why many people can mark it outside of five mile radius.
15:04
Good people are too lazy to drive further right there.
Too lazy.
You're like but our gym, so great.
It's like yeah, but they're going to choose a shittier Jim that's closer to them just the unreal, right?
And so if you can take the service to them, which we now have the opportunity to learn the skill set to do that, you can by the time, this thing turns back on probably have more recurring profit profit income than you did before this.
15:26
But it's for the people who want to win and who want to take action.
Otherwise if you're just going to wait, totally cool will help you when you want to come.
Back because we do that too.
But that's just my that's my two cents right now and I know that whenever I talk about online, it's always polarizing.
But I have a really hard time.
Not speaking my mind about something that I think is more profitable, and I think it's lower risk.
15:44
And I think in the post Corona economy, the businesses that will win or the ones that have lower overhead and have higher margins and have a higher ability to reach customers where they're at and all of those boxes get checked and then you get all the added bonus Bennett's benefits.
That I said earlier virtually unlimited lead flow cheaper, Leads bigger, radius, higher profit margin.
16:05
You get all of those things on top of everything.
I said.
So anyways, don't let the oh shit moment happened to you.
Take action now, start selling remote, I think it is, it is incredibly incredibly incredibly awesome right now and you should get it by keeping great catch you soon.









0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
Welcome to the gym, secret spot.
Cast.
My name is Alex from Rosie and I will be your host on this magical carpet ride that we call owning a gym last episode talked about Jim numbers or acquisition processes that I find Superior to lbos or low barrier to entry offers.
0:46
If you didn't listen to that one, listen to them first and then come back to this one.
But the next question is.
Okay, what happens once your gym is full?
Okay, so I'm a big advocate of having a value letter, which I would say that if you don't have one, you should But not having one core.
1:02
I mean you should have core services but they should be able to naturally Ascend people from one level to the next which then says, okay.
Well, let's say you have a boot camp at $150 a month.
That's what most people have.
I would say that I talked to those who can't cross the fence about the same price is about 50 now, they say about 50, but then they have all these people who were grandfathered in and they're they're Blended.
1:22
Average is like $110, but I won't even get into that.
And but but What you need though?
Is that volume in the front.
Door is important.
Okay, the volume is important because then it allows you to do a lot of cool stuff allows you to sell one-off programs, very effectively, which are what I call Cash plays, which I'll get to in a nother podcast.
1:46
Would it also allows you to besides that, is that when you have like the buzz of the gym, you can sell supplements, you can sell apparel, and there's specific ways that we have learned after trial and error and error.
And error and error to, finally, get the way that actually freaking worked.
2:05
And as soon as you do that, it's like once you have it, it's like, if you have the right information, it feels really easy because you like just try this thing or you just do an email blast and like all of a sudden, all these people come back and they give you money, because you did the right sequence, like, it's mind-blowing, but it just takes time to get to that to that point.
2:23
But but anyway, so what do you do?
After you have your gym full?
Right, so you have, you know, 250-300 dfts I'm at you know, Buck 50 a month, something like that, right?
This is where I'm bigger advocate of instead of opening and mind you, this is some coming from somebody who had six gems.
2:41
If I could do it all differently and do it all again, I would have grown more slowly.
I know I think for me a part of it was like, you know, I had an ego and I wanted to, you know, beat my chest and say how many gyms I had.
But I would have Groan EFT, even even further by implementing High tickets.
2:59
That way sooner.
Okay, now I'm telling you the high-tech game is life, changing its game-changing.
It's amazing.
It's awesome.
It's just like soon as you get into it, you'll never want to do anything else, but you need to suffer through your, your low ticket offers.
3:15
So you can have an appreciation for for clients to pay 400. $500 a month.
It's be your gym because they are way better.
They will stay longer.
They will love you more, they will get better.
Salts and like they're the easiest people to World Service.
But the question is, where do you find these mythical uniforms?
3:30
Now, you need to do the sequentially because at least I believe that you need to do.
You know, you should fill up or at least have a very busy low-end offer because then it justifies the introduction of a higher ticket offer.
Because if you have something that's three hundred four hundred five, hundred dollars a month, then it makes sense because you can then say, Hey, you know, I have such high demand on my time.
3:54
If you Want if you want, you know, a piece of the special cheese, then you need to pay more right now in the beginning, if your owner operator, then I would recommend being the person to start it because then it'll naturally attract people because a lot of people love you, which is why you're just right.
And when you get there, you'll automatically, if people want to send and be with you, so it'll kick it off very easily from that standpoint.
4:18
But the other reason is that you'll also learn some of the roads.
Now, if you already have multiple locations, then Going to have to, you know, have a manager or hire a trainer whose high quality to run that program.
Now, the reason that I love it so much is that if you're charging something four times or five times, the price of what your normal offer is, you only need like one fifth of the amount of people to match the revenue.
4:44
Okay now let's say like we had 250 EFT is right to 258, he's in a buck 50 a month as 32,000 amonth which might you everyone for a gym still isn't that much money.
Because most gyms especially if you're going to be not like truly owner-operated but have someone who does sales for you and maybe the manager and then you've got your front desk girls and you've got the have to be a girl.
5:05
Can be a guy and then and then your trainers like your overhead all in.
Probably will be looking at like 18 thousand a month, maybe 20,000 a month, so you're not going to have a ton left over but anyways, so that's that's the that's the first level.
5:22
But if you had another Membership.
That was four hundred dollars a month and you had 60 people in it, right?
You're making another twenty twenty four thousand dollars a month.
So almost the same amount that you're making.
What is that?
3/4, right?
5:40
75% of the amount of money that you're making right now from servicing. 250, customers.
You're making from servicing only 60.
At $400 a month.
Okay, so it just shows you the power of having a higher ticket offer now like you should have that Ascension because it just it just shows clear differentiation and you and mind you.
6:02
I know a lot of guys who I talk to are usually trying to do like they're like oh we have two levels of membership.
We have like 135 and and 155, you know what I mean?
I'm not I'm not the biggest proponent of that.
I think that people make decisions in like, pricing decisions in.
6:20
Bigger jumps than that.
So I think that 135 and 150 and 120 and 160 are all more or less, the same pricing decision, right?
Once you break you know into the 350 400 category, it's the same deal.
6:38
And the nice thing is that the higher the ticket price, the bigger, the rungs of decision making, which means you have more latitude in how much you can charge.
So let's say you do, if you saw someone on a 2,000 dollar, Any package you probably could have sold them on 2,500, that's my guess.
6:55
Now 2,500 dollars is 500 dollars more for the same service.
Like it sounds doesn't sound like much, right when we're talking about it.
But but that would be five months of someone buying your hundred dollar monthly gift it is significant, right?
7:11
But it doesn't seem that way because it's it's a contrast principle.
So compared to to comparatively it looks it doesn't seem like that much compared to 2000 or 2500. 100 500 and seem like much of a difference but it really is it's like when you're buying a house and you know you're negotiating pricing and you go from you know, 250 you know thousand dollars.
7:32
And then you know they counter with, you know, 2260, right.
It doesn't sound like that big of a difference, this 10 grand, right but it's just relative scale.
So the bigger the higher, the ticket, the more margin you can actually induce because The decision Point, once you crack, once you break through that decision, making process in their study to actually genuinely think about whether they want to do it.
7:57
The price is no longer like it's much more wavy like it's movable, which is just really important point because it just makes you a lot more money.
But the question then is, how do you get to find these mythical people, right?
And that's where I was talking about earlier.
8:13
We're in last episode, we're having a middle ticket, offer 500, 600 offer.
I think works very well in to $200 a month membership 150 to 200.
I think we're really well there.
Hey guys, real quick.
8:28
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I guess a partner with you.
8:51
So that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
Because most of the people who spent 500 or willing to spend a buck fifty to two hundred dollars a month, so it's actually kind of a Down South so so it's like here's your front end, which I like having the front and more expensive because I think logically it actually makes more sense because they're going to be the ones who take the most attention and they're the ones who you need to pay off the acquisition, cost the most, right?
9:17
Because you just spent money on Facebook or Instagram or whatever it was right to acquire these people as customers.
So, I need to get that money back ASAP.
So I charge them their membership.
You plus a little bit extra for the for the hassle.
You cost me and having to pay for marketing money just to get you in the door to solve your problem, right?
9:35
So that's why I believe in having more expensive front ends than I'd even do recurring because, and you also have condition someone.
So though, I just got this experience for $2000 for 12 weeks which is, I don't know, 666.
I think we're good.
9:51
All right, well, forget that but it's, you know, whatever 650 700 dollars a month.
For them to do that program.
But if off the back end of that, you down some into four ninety-nine a month or 450 a month or three ninety-nine a month, then it seems like they're getting a deal, right?
10:08
So I love that better than the.
Hey you we just gave you all this stuff for for nothing.
Now, pay us four times as much for the same thing, it's like, it didn't, it didn't liquidate the acquisition cost, so you had to front the money to acquire them and then on the back end, they don't feel like they're getting a deal.
10:24
They feel like, oh, now I have to pay the full price, you know, I'm saying.
So that's that's how we've always done it and it's worked really, really well for us.
And so I would encourage you to to look at that.
But that being said so you're like what offer is convert?
Well for a A higher ticket.
10:43
Recurring person.
And it tends to be either one of two things.
Long duration, such a 12-week. 12-week type deals or short duration?
It's never like, this is just me from experience.
Six weeks tends to work best for the middle ticket, guys.
10:59
Start middle ticket into low ticket and then 28 days and and 12 weeks as the work best going into a higher ticket, recurring offer.
And I think that's because there's different psychology around it.
11:16
I think a 28 day you can basically sign them up on the eft the first day, they walk in the door and you're just telling them, you know, they're just going to get this tiny tiny period of time.
But like the thing is, is that that 28-day program should still be almost palpable to what the price is that they're going to stay out.
11:33
Forward.
So it's really just signing up an EFT.
It's just not positioned that way, right?
If you do the if you do like a longer duration package, then you should really be able to Jack the price over and above what the normal EFT is.
11:50
And that's where you're getting, you know, $700 a month instead of four hundred dollars a month on the back end, sorry on the front end and what it does is it allows you to liquidate a cross.
So there's there's an advantage to both.
I think we've done it both ways.
I'll, I really like them both.
12:06
I don't have a huge preference.
I think it's just important to rotate the offers in the marketplace.
The oversaturate, but that's that is.
This is the next natural step.
That's what you should be looking at.
Once you filled up your base level facility.
So if you're like, well, you know, we got changed into the plant, open up the gym.
12:23
I don't think that's why.
I think that you should put another level of service in and then further, boost your revenue and have an Ascension that shows people where they should be going because most people can't do a higher level of service.
I mean, most of us as Fitness professionals, you know, a lot of us don't even train the way we train, our Clients honestly, right?
12:41
So the closer you can get them to train the way you train them or you can charge them and the more they're going to believe you because you know they've moved past.
I just need to move my body and show up to the gym to like you know maybe I need some like actual lifting and need some like real programming and all that kind of stuff.
So anyways, I promise you guys, the beginning that I would try not to make these too long, mostly because my attention span is probably shorter than yours but I hope that was useful for you in terms of an illustration of why Guy like you should have a high ticket thing.
13:12
You, I would definitely not just stay with a low ticket, should have an Ascension plan, but ironically you're going to bring them in with different vehicles to send them into those programs.
And that way you can maximize your facility maximize Revenue per square foot and ultimately make yourself a stronger competitor in the marketplace.
13:32
So hope you guys have an awesome day rock and roll and I will talk to you soon.0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review if it was a post if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
Hello everyone and welcome to the gym sneakers podcast.
I'm your host name is Alex and Today we're going to be talking about the sales process from the spiritual theoretical standpoint.
0:35
I was talking to Dina Derek's a good friend of mine.
He's the best copywriter in Amazon.
Unbelievable.
He's an awesome.
Awesome, copy guy.
And he was like dude he's like your sales process is so awesome and it was just from that conversation.
I wanted to bring this up so I'd know if your gym owner you want to get to Jim Poole, go to I don't hate money.com and go play and you get a bunch of cool stuff.
0:54
Anyways, all right, to the point.
So a lot of people He's like, I realized that when I was reading your copy and I was listening to your pitch, he's like all you do is sell the vacation.
And I think a really easy analogy to this is that like, you always sell the vacation, you don't sell the plane flight, okay?
1:13
Like write it in your wall, put it on like above your computer.
Tell your sales team, you never sell the plane flight.
You're not selling going to TSA taking your belt off waiting for your plane.
The connection, the the drag the turbulence of the plane, the crappy food?
1:29
I mean Person is farting next.
Like, you don't cover any of that stuff.
You sell Maui, right?
That's what you sell.
Now, what you're selling is always virtually the same and I'm going to cover the.
I'm going to circle back on this about the big main idea but you're going to always sell that vacation.
1:46
The difference in level of service is how they want to get there because they're going to get to Maui, right.
But do they want to take doing the?
Do they want to walk there from where they're at?
That'll probably take a long time and they'll be mosquitoes.
They can get robbed.
Dangerous, but I felt like, but they could do that, right?
2:03
That's option.
One, option two is, you can take a bunch of buses will take a long time to.
But at least there's like you know, some Wi-Fi, some really really slow Wi-Fi on the bus and you know the leak, they're out of the sun, right?
You know above that they could, they could just take normal flights.
You know.
2:18
This is this normal good old-fashioned fights.
You know, over above that they can take a personal private jet and go straight point.
A to point B, they have no connections, no layovers, no nothing, and they've got some person with given him champagne.
Whole time.
They're all right.
They're all going to Maui but depends the speed and the quality of the journey, that is how it like, what you sell virtually is always the same thing, okay?
2:42
So like we have, we have multiple levels of service within our business, right?
And those are only service because we saw like products but I won't get into it.
But the point is is that we mostly saw the exact same thing.
We're going to fill up your gym and help you make more money as we saw, right?
2:59
It's just what vehicle do.
Want to take how long do you want to take you?
Right.
How much support you want?
Along the way?
It's all this.
But the Viet like, but like but the the main goal is the same.
And so when you're selling your membership, it should almost always sound the same.
But there's something personal training or you're selling whatever and you should usually start with the one on one fight because some guys just 101 on fight.
3:19
And the nice thing is that if you start high, you price anchor, you know, a ten thousand dollar, one way, you know, Plain Sight, when you tell them that they can get a flight for, you know, 499.
They're like, okay, I can do that right now.
If you start at 499, they might be They might balk at that.
But if you started 4,000 for a program when you say a couple hundred bucks sound like nothing, right, you can always squeeze margin that way.
3:40
Just as a side note.
Now the second thing I wanted to talk about today was the concept of a promise, okay?
So every single person within your space or really any vertical Industries, makes more or less the same products, okay?
Like me every Mark, like every marketing agency that speaks to gym owners, every Guru, everyone every coach, right?
4:02
They all say more.
Or less the same thing, right?
The promise isn't that different they say we're not be generate more leads.
It's get you you know help you get more customers, helping make more money with your gym, right?
And then some of them throw in like an automation systems and freedom and I mean that whatever right?
4:17
But that's more or less.
It was just one sometimes.
I feel like sales isn't that hard but I could get into that.
But the point there though is that like the promise is more or less always the same.
And so it's like, well then how does this guy?
4:33
So way more than this guy, right?
How do we sell so much more than every other coach and marking gauge the other?
That's our discriminant, right?
How do we do that?
We do it because we hit the other thing, right?
Because there's two questions in sales one.
Do you think that if this thing does what we say?
4:50
It does it's worth what were charging, we're asking for, right?
They say.
Yes.
They move on to the second with him.
Almost every time.
It's, yes, right.
If you help someone texted Jim.
Is it worth X?
And I'm like, well.
Yeah.
Right.
So then it's the second question and no one addresses that everyone keeps selling like, don't you?
5:08
Like, we're going to tax your business.
We're going to do all these things.
Right there.
They make, they make these out rate and that's why these claims can be, they can get more and more outrageous, right?
I don't think we've 10x anyone's business, they do know.
We've know, we text - hey guys, real quick.
5:26
For those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans, I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype four hundred dollar leads, but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar, and How to segment customers, make more money.
5:43
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward, slash leads.
It's for free in exchange for your email, so that I can email you when we launched under leads.
And so that you can not miss out on it because last time I sold out for like eight straight weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
6:01
But like I'd like I could just reliably get you to sick.
I can get you 6 figures a month.
If you're like if you're at 30 we get you to 100 but like I can't get you to 300.
I don't know how in one gym.
I don't know how, right, I guess you two hundred and we were really repeatable process but the point here is that the second question is, how do I get you to believe that statement is true?
6:23
Okay. if what I'm saying is true, Is it worth what I'm asking for it.
They say, yes, you know, like, cool.
And what would you need to see to believe me?
Okay, that's essentially, what sales is, is those two main questions.
6:39
And so once you've made the proposition, once you've made the promise, and someone isn't buying, then all you're really facing is, how do you like, what would you need to believe me?
Because you said that, like, if I can help you lose 60 pounds, right?
But it's worth $5000 to you, right?
6:55
I mean, you they go to plastic surgeon to get tummy tucks for 10 grand, so it's worth that to them, right?
So it's like so it's worth $5000.
If I can get you lose 60 pounds in this amount of time, she says, yes, okay, then what would you need to believe for me to show you that we can actually follow through with that promise?
7:13
Okay, I'm going to make a second one about how you can increase.
Someone's conviction in the next podcast.
Make sure you check it out but otherwise for anyone else who's listening.
Be sure to go to.
I don't need money.com and you can check out like 60, plus amazing.
Testimonials of gyms that went from zero to full capacity, in 30 days, using our system, and then went on to riches Fame and Glory.
7:36
So you should definitely apply.
All right, have an awesome day, guys.
I'll catch you guys on the next podcast.









0:00
What's going on, everybody?
I'm bringing some more books, but I wanted to say that, if you haven't checked out Hunter million-dollar offers, I would definitely suggest that you start there.
I've gotten some solid feedback and it couldn't be happier with its.
Number one ranking on Amazon for direct marketing and over 5,000, five star reviews.
So, thank you guys so much for that.
0:15
It's 164 pages.
I really can help you out.
It takes about four hours to get through, check it out.
On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
The audiobook is Lowe's, they'll let me put it on for it, so I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
It really Lee doesn't work well when you do that because then they just get really pissed off.
0:33
Welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Hey, what's going on, everyone?
Happy Monday, hope you guys are rocking and rolling and steam rolling through the week with a strong start.
0:52
I wanted to make this quick video how to have hard conversations in hard times, because I had sorry for my voice sounds worse.
I've just been on calls all day long.
I just got off a one-hour call with our gym owners because I'm doing these every day.
Now, to just make sure everyone's cool and everyone's, you know, just everything can get answered within a day, right?
1:10
That's kind of my goal.
So, anyways, and I had a gym owner who came up and was like, hey, You know, I had all my trainers get together and they were like, Hey, we're not happy with what we're getting paid.
We want a 60/40 split on the revenue from the gym, right?
And I got I got literally like so visibly pissed off.
1:28
Like I felt like it was happening to me.
And and so I wanted to kind of walk you through what I think is has been.
And like, I'm somebody who a lot.
It's like, I have gotten better over time as I've been more weathered, but I used to get really angry with that kind of stuff.
And so I've I've kind of adapted.
1:45
So typically what I found is that when people have these really harsh responses to decisions that we've had to make in hard times, like a lot of us are making a lot of hard decisions right now and it's just part of the circumstances, you know, I mean, it comes with the territory and so we have to accept that but I think there's definitely a good and a bad way of doing it, and so the way that I think I used to do things was I would make decisions and then I would come down the hill and then like show them the Commandments, you know what I mean?
2:09
Like, I was I was the almighty in my business but the reality is It's it really doesn't work well when you do that because then they just get really pissed off.
And they're like, screw this guy, he doesn't know that Bob, all right.
And then they start forming these little coalition's, these little factions behind your back and so I think it's far more productive to kind of do it in this framework.
2:31
And so first off, whenever I have to introduce a new change, we remind them of the vision, right?
Which is like where we trying to go, right?
So it's like, hey guys, like before we get going we got a lot of, a lot of stuff we got to get through, but I sort of like, like, is everybody here still in it?
To try and help people to, you know, change people's lives really better.
2:47
The community is everyone here.
So on the same page, everyone still want that goal and if everyone's like yes it's like, Okay, cool.
So that's so we've kind of put that as the as the light post, right?
It's like that's where we're headed.
That's where we're trying to go.
All right?
And so because of that like because we're still trying to accomplish that mission.
3:03
Things outside of obviously changed, right?
Would you guys agree with that?
Like circumstances have changed right?
Okay cool.
And so right now we're bringing in the last the than what we're spending and so if we Accomplish that goal of transforming the community Etc.
3:19
We have to change something.
And so this is what I've usually the variables from considering right now.
All right?
And so it's like we're still, we still have to pay rent.
We still got to pay these marketing costs.
We still got to pay this and this and this.
And so there's kind of these are the three options that I see, right.
3:35
Option.
Number one is that everyone everyone here takes two weeks off a month, right?
So that's one option.
All right, option two is we just have to let go of half the staff.
So that when we come back that there's something to come back to, right?
And that's me, literally, Early trying to keep that Vision alive because otherwise we won't we won't be able to stay.
3:52
We want to be able to stay afloat.
All right?
And then option three is, you know, we structure this this new way where everyone everyone works full time, but for half pay and I'm starting with my own pee.
All right, so I'm taking a pay cut.
I'm taking half of what I normally take or less than that, or in pain.
I'm taking home 0 right now.
4:09
All right.
So I'm starting to like, you all are going to get paid.
I'm getting paid nothing.
Okay?
And so, if you start like that, it's like we're in this together, right?
And we say that, you can present The options you can be fairly forthcoming is like I honestly like I'm leaning more towards like hey if you guys are all still in this with me I'm taking zero.
4:28
If you guys can take half then like we can make it through this, right?
If you'd rather me just say like you know, if half of you are comfortable with that then like if you want to leave, then that works and I can keep, you know, the other half of you at full pay.
Like that's one that's one solution but I just want to know what you guys want.
4:47
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
5:07
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
Now, obviously only offer offer options that yet you would support, right?
And I think why this kind of approach works is because you're not presenting your decision, you are presenting options and allowing them to participate in the decision.
5:30
And then they have ownership over the outcome.
And so then they get more bought in and they understand why?
Because most times, when I've given a decision from the mountain, top of me, like this is how it's going to be.
If people don't get why you made the decision, they resent the Decision where they think you're an idiot and it's usually because they just don't have the information.
5:49
You had something.
Give you a different example that still illustrates this and it's another kind of hard conversation that some of you may have already had or will have in the future which is sometimes you have to let a trainer go, right?
Sometimes it just doesn't work out, it's okay.
It's part of business.
All right, but I've let trainers go and then had a swath you know or whatever the term is a gaggle.
6:10
You know of clients come up to me like that was a big mistake.
It was awesome.
We loved Rachel.
I only came here for a right and just point their finger at me, right?
And I would, and I took that and I was like, man, this really sucks and so rather than like, flashback or talk shit, right?
6:26
Which you should do, you can't do it as an employer, right?
Which, you know, it sucks because he'd love to just tell them why you're letting go.
You can't in virtually every state and so you got to be like, you know, mrs.
Thompson, I told him we're coming from.
I can tell you that this is what this this decision really weighed on my heart.
6:42
And so, I just wanna ask you a couple questions that might make this.
You know, make the decision, makes more sense to you.
So, first off, is there, anybody who you think has a higher investment in having, you have an amazing experience here than me the owner of the business, right?
Yes.
Okay, cool.
The fact that you are distraught that Rachel left shows me in some way that you care, which I really appreciate, right?
7:02
So, thank you for caring enough to even tell me and for, you know, in some way having the faith that like, if you liked Rachel, you kind of liked likes, the the selection that I made for the trainer's that we had because I was a loner higher.
So I We appreciate that.
So I just want you to know, like thank you for coming number one.
7:18
Now the the sad part of just kind of business ownership on the hardest part has been here sooner.
Ships is that?
I cannot share all of the information around a decision because of legal reasons, right?
So, for example, and I'm saying nothing about Rachel, she's an amazing person.
But, for example, if Rachel had stolen something, if we had, you know, concerns with theft, I wouldn't be able to share that with you if we had a sexual complaint from him.
7:40
Remember that, would you think that I would be something that I should handle, right?
Of course, right.
If I had that, I could not disclose that to you, right?
I'm not saying Rachel did that, but I'm saying like so do you think that there it may be possible that I have more information that I'm working with the new order to make this decision?
Do you think it's possible?
Yes.
7:55
Okay.
So here's what I would bet, I would bet that if I were able to open up the kimono and show you all of the information that I have here, you probably would have come out the same decision that I had and probably even sooner than I am because you're way smarter than I am, right?
You probably would have made the decision sooner.
And so all I'm asking you to trust me that I really want this business to see just as much or probably more than anyone else.
8:15
Be, I appreciate that you cared enough to even bring this up to me and see just understand that.
Like if you had the same information I do I'm sure that you probably would have come to the same decision but have faith.
If you liked Rachel, I will find a trainer that you will like just as much as you did her.
I know it sounds unrealistic right now but there's always a way and we're dedicated to having an amazing experience for you.
8:33
All right?
And so once you like and so explaining to someone that like we don't make these decisions in a vacuum, right?
Is that we have information that they don't have Make this decision and if they have the same information, they would have come to the same outcome, right?
8:50
And so just like were explaining to the to the upset client about Rachel leaving.
It's the same thing.
When you're talking to your trainers when you're like, listen, these are the variables, right?
And so the gym owner, who brought this up, had his trainer say, they wanted a 60/40 split of the revenue and I was like, You guys probably assume that I just like, take 60%.
9:08
I just walk my way to the bank.
Right?
That's what.
That's what I'm assuming it's.
Do you think, right?
So let's walk through this.
Of a hundred dollars that comes in the door.
I was like, do you know what the margin this business is.
Do you know?
Cause like it's 12%, that's the margin.
So if we've lost 20% current just through this whole Corona thing.
9:28
We lost 20%.
You guys show up to work and you get paid, right?
I show up to work and not only do I not get paid, I lose money.
So I work as many or more hours than you and I lose money.
Do you feel like that's fair?
No, of course, it's not fair but that's that's how business is Right?
9:46
And so we have to make these adjustments because it's just math, right?
And so if you think that giving 20% to you for this, you're getting 20 percent actually getting paid this month.
The 80% is to keep the fucking doors up, right?
I'm getting 080 is what it takes to run this thing, right?
10:02
And so it's just understanding, I'm not laughing my way to the bank.
Is your is your is your is your getting paid?
You're getting compensated for this, right?
And you also don't have to take on risk.
I sign my name on a 400,000 or lease.
Like do you guys want That I have a lease for my equipment.
Do you guys want to sign your name on that?
10:18
Of course.
I think it take my house.
You do a bad job.
You go home.
I do a bad job.
I lose my home.
You just a difference and that's why that's why these decisions are hard to make, right?
So explaining that to someone a lot of times can give them Clarity, because most people aren't stupid right now.
10:34
They may not operate with all the information, but typically, if you have a scene individual who has, who is investing the same outcome, because same Mission and values.
Once you present them, the same information, many times they will.
The same conclusion you did and they'll be like alright I understand why you did that.
And that's all you need is understanding, right?
10:51
And so that being said you're like listen to Jimmy a million hard decisions, you might not agree with all of them because shit, I don't agree with half the decisions.
I'm making right now because it sucks, right?
But I'm doing the best I can and I promise you I'm gonna make a ton more mistakes, too.
But as long as you're still in this, with me to get where we're trying to go, we're going to make it out of this, all right?
11:07
Not only that there's gonna be a lot of gyms to aren't as unified as we are.
They don't have the culture.
We have, they don't have the mission.
We had, they do on the values we have and they're not gonna be able to make Get out.
So don't let the virus in the flu in the pandemic win.
Don't let it break us apart, let us make a stronger, take their side of this as dedicated even more dedicated the goal because now the hardship made us stronger, all right?
11:26
So that's what I'm asking for you guys.
So big picture, that's kind of the framework that I think you can use to have hard conversations to Hard Times.
Hopefully, that was valuable for you.
Maybe you have a trainer or coach or clients that you have to talk to.
I think the easiest thing is helping them, make the decision with you not that you were actually necessarily listening to what they're going to say.
11:45
Yeah.
But more.
So presenting the options as you saw them with the information that you had.
A lot of times they're going to understand why you did with what you did.
Maybe they won't agree, but they'll understand why.
So anyways, I hope you guys have an amazing Monday.
I hope that was viable for you.
Please drop a like or comment.
And if you're listening on the podcast, please leave a review.
12:00
Otherwise have an amazing day.
I'll get you guys input side but









0:00
Real quick.
Cause you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
Everyone buy some What I mean by that is that everyone has some money, right?
No matter what and everyone has this problem and we should find a way to help everyone to a certain degree.
Welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
0:46
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on, everyone?
Welcome back, quick.
Little tactical training for you today as well.
How to close everyone down selling like a prop.
So, one of the big beliefs that I like to set in our communities, that everyone buy something, what I mean by that is that everyone has some money, right?
1:05
No matter what and everyone has this problem and we should find a way to help everyone to a certain degree, right?
And obviously you want to try and sell your primary program because that's going to be your objective.
That's because you think it's the thing.
It's going to help them the most Etc.
But there come times where people can afford it for whatever.
Right?
1:21
This is reality or anyone tells you otherwise, whatever full.
So in the real world of sales understanding how to down cell, like a champ is, one of the reasons that you'll be able to massively increase your pro, your clothes right now doing it properly.
Is one of the key is one of the key points here.
1:37
All right, so when you do it poorly, it sounds like begging.
And it sounds like you totally lose your frame in the sale and now you sound desperate and aggressive and clingy.
And you sound like you've got, I love this term Commission.
Breath.
And, and basically just ruins the sale and then they don't, even if they could afford it, they don't want to buy from you because of what you're doing, right?
1:56
It sounds unethical, Etc.
Like wait, you just said it was this price.
You're just going to keep lowering it.
And so, the key to doing this is having a key set of cards that you have in your back pocket that you can choose to play as you go down, right?
So it's kind of like a step down, all right?
2:12
And the way that you do this is through exchange, all right, so one of the other powerful influences in human psychology and jet in general, is is reciprocity.
All right, we have a very hard time if someone gives you something not giving something back.
The beautiful thing is is that after you exchange something, the person who sets the terms always has the power in the agreement.
2:33
So, for example, if someone asks me to do something, which is essentially what they're doing when they say, no, they can't afford that.
They're asking you to do something for them.
Right?
Can you do it for Less?
That's that's the implication, right?
They can't do it for that.
What else can you do?
And so, there's a study that like, showed this in a I mean, there's hundreds of Studies that show this.
2:51
But we're they took people in colleges and they let them cut in line.
And the thing is, is that doing a small favor.
People don't have a good idea of what of what get like equality in and exchanges.
3:06
And so if you do a small favor for someone and after you do the small favor then make a big ask, it's still very hard for people to say no.
All right?
And so that's the things that people don't have with reciprocity and Yes, fairness of exchange there.
3:22
I like, it's like, hey yeah, I remember I bought you lunch yesterday.
Can you take me to the airport and back this weekend or can you help me move out of my apartment?
Like that's not a fair exchange.
The thing is that with reciprocity, people say yes to things because of just underlying human psychology.
3:39
Alright, so here's how you use reciprocity, which is one of the strongest things motivators for persuasion in a down selling environment.
Alright, so after let's say you offer your primary program you're like, hey it's you know, No, it's X, right?
And they're like II, just can't afford that.
3:55
So you say is this, you say, tell you what, I'll do it for this if you XYZ right, if you leave me a testimonial so I'll drop the price in half.
If you leave me a testimonial fair enough and when you say that it's like they asked you to make some sort of adjustment, you take that in consideration, you make the adjustment and you make the offer again, when you say does that sound fair, right?
4:20
And the thing, It's very difficult for people to keep hearing that over and over again and not, say yes.
So give you an example.
One of the step Downs that we use its really successful.
And so, let's say we're selling our front-end program for $300.
Alright, for 300 bucks a week, very straightforward, three weeks.
All right, so they say no, they say, you know, that's too much for me to say no problem.
4:39
What if we just did, 49 and weeks for 12 weeks, right with a commitment.
And so we're doing is that you always have these, you always have these cards that you can play.
So in a fitness example, right?
You have the term so How long they're committing to, that's number one.
Number two, you can ask them to give you a testimonial, you can ask them to give you reviews, you can ask them to bring a friend.
4:58
And each of these things are things that you can ask them to do so that you can ethically lower the price because you're asking them to do more, all right.
On top of that.
You can also add bonuses in the original package, I don't like, removing bonuses as much because like I want to give them those things and so it's more.
5:15
Like, I'd rather go in the other direction of asking them to do more things for me and that, If someone else is like why she paying X and I'm paying Z, you can say, well, she's doing some extra things for me that you're not and they're like oh and so that way you're not saying like two people are having different prices for the same program because you've made additional terms to the agreement, right?
5:36
So traditional step down be like, hey, can you do this thing for 299?
They say, no, you say awesome.
No worries.
You know what?
I can just cut the price in half and if you can just commit to 12 weeks, fair enough, they say no.
And you say, okay, no worries.
Let's just Not even worried about the commitment.
5:51
Just get you started today for 49 bucks, fair enough, they say no you're say all right, and you have to acknowledge that it gets kind of increasing ridiculous as you make more and more offers right in a in a light tone because it's still going to pull on that internal mechanism inside of people.
6:09
To take action, say yes.
Okay.
So we started, we've already done two drop downs.
We did half price with commitment, then we remove commitment $49.
All right, we're 49.
And we were limited commitment.
That's two.
Step Downs are step underneath of that.
You like, all right, how about this?
I'll do it for 39.
If you leave me a testimony at the end, fair enough.
6:28
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, And also we have the testimonial.
6:50
You're also putting another implication that they're going to get results, so you're selling while you're while you're down selling at the same time, right now you said three down sounds fair enough.
They're like, no, I still can't do it.
You're like all right, cool.
Let's just get you kicked off at $29 a week.
Pay as you go, don't worry about it and just bring a friend in the first 30 days.
7:09
All right.
That way, I can least cover my costs and that way it gets me at least half price.
What I was saying before, fair enough, it's hard for someone to hear that.
Like, have you make all of these?
What is it accommodations for them?
And not say, yes, three, four, five, six times.
7:27
And be very clear about how you're asking for this.
Don't just say, sound good sound.
Great.
Cool.
That's not the call to action.
The call to action when you're down.
Simon.
I really like this in general.
What I'm selling is fair enough?
Sound fair?
7:43
Because you're lowering the bar just say yeah, that sounds fair.
You're like awesome.
Great.
We'll card you want to use.
Let's get you started right?
If you want, you can even trade these really cool.
Do you want to do your, you know, your tuition appointment in the morning or the afternoon she already taken more micro steps in the right commitment for?
7:59
Yes to the card if you want to do that.
All right but I'll go I'll go through this one more time for everyone who's listening.
So primary offer its 299.
It's got all this amazing stuff, fair enough?
No, okay, no worries.
What we can do is if the price is enough but you really still want this.
8:16
If you if you want to just go longer with your probably, Need anyways, right?
I'll do it for 49 and we just half of what I said earlier.
All right, fair enough.
And when you're asking this, you have to ask it.
Like, you actually want them to say yes.
And that's why the tonality is so important.
Just like, read the script and be like, so, unfair, like you have to be like, fair enough, like you have to really, you have to ask it like you're actually asking them to say, yes, I know this sounds minor but it's everything over the phone when you don't have your body to make so that they can see because only 9% of communications verbal, right?
8:48
And everything else is how you say the words not just the words you're saying right?
I can give you another example of like how I can take one sentence and make it mean like six things by how you say it.
Alright sales the same thing.
So big program they say no commitment at half-price fair enough they say no you say listen don't worry about it I get it sometimes coming can be scary.
9:08
How about this?
I'll just let you get started for day.
Pay.
As you go, I'll prove myself.
I we don't have to get married.
We can just start first date.
Right 49?
All right, fair enough.
Enough.
You got to really wait for it.
No like no.
Like, okay, you're killing me.
9:24
That's okay.
No worries.
We'll get the starter.
I will figure this out together.
The thing is that when you're doing this, it's collaborative.
You're on the same side of the table saying, let's figure out a way to make this work, right?
Because if you have built the Rapport throughout the sale, you've dug the pain, right?
So they know that this is something that they need to do and they know they need to do with you.
9:41
They will work with you as long as you maintain report and you don't get aggressive, right?
And so you're like, okay no worries.
How about this?
I'll do it for 39 a week.
All right, so it's 25% off of my already 50% off, right?
If you just leave me a testimony at the end.
9:57
Fair enough.
It's hard for, like, it's hard for people to keep saying no to that, you're like, okay 39.
All right, I'll do it.
All right, this is, this is the, this is the best I can do, right?
Because at this point, I'm pretty much paying you to work out.
All right.
So it's, I can do this for 29.
10:13
All right.
Just send me a friend in the first 30 days.
That way.
At least I can get back to the 49, that just at least covers my costs, fair enough.
And we say it like that.
You see how the tonality changes, right?
The like man, this guy is really trying to help me out, he's really trying to accommodate me and so when you drop down that many to like at this point we're at six dropdowns.
10:33
Okay.
So so this person, all right, if they say no at this point that in my opinion it's not a money thing.
You lost them earlier on in the sale they're trying to get off and at some point earlier on they became disengage with a phone call.
All right that's where you get.
The hey can I get the credit card?
They hang up, right?
10:49
It's because they're just done with the conversation.
They just want.
They just want to get off the phone.
It in person, they can't just get off the phone.
You have a little bit more fighting room over the phone.
It's not that way, right?
And so these are the things and that's why you have to confront the obstacles earlier on, like, someone's disengaged.
11:04
They're not paying attention.
They're giving you surface level problems.
That's real.
Hey, can I be real with you instead of nice to you?
And then you deliver the deliver the painter like hey I'm not saying that to make you feel bad, all right, I'm saying that.
So I can help, right?
And so when you say that it's like you've given yourself permission to inject the truth, rub the paint a little bit, then you put a bandaid on it afterwards.
11:24
All right.
And so, anyhow that's that's that's early on objections.
I won't get into that right now but knowing how to down, Sout will massively, increase your crows rate.
And by adding these little cards that you have that you can trade with people, on allows you to have flexibility in the deal.
11:40
All right, and then that way they can feel like you accommodated them, you still help them.
And then ultimately what you're doing is just trying to get your foot in the door because in seven days and 14 days, they're finally going to trust you and then they'll buy the full, the full price program later, like, don't worry about it.
It's just like, let's get you going.
11:55
Let's get you in the in our world so that we can provide value, and then after that, we'll make it work.
All right?
So two cents on down selling you need to know how to down south and you know how to do it ethically without sounding like you're begging or being pushy.
And that's how you do it.
All right.
Lots of everyone.
If you like this.
You drop a comment, drop review, drop you know.
12:12
Drop a whatever engage with this and have a heavy miraculous Wednesday.
All right.
Kid, you soon?
Bye.









0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
And so they want to maintain consistency because people do not like people appearing in Consistent, welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
0:39
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on, every one of you guys have an awesome start to your Wednesday Wacky Wednesday.
Um, I'll make this short and sweet for you advance sales technique to get over decision-maker obstacles.
So, one of the big obstacles you have in any selling situation, especially in a transactional say, like Fitness is, you know, I have to talk to my spouse.
1:01
I have to talk to, I mean typically it'll be a spouse if it's weight loss and so that's what I wanted to cover today.
So the first time I heard of this technique was in Psychology class in college.
The next time I heard about this was from Frank Kern in a sales training that he was doing and he had this big ethical disclaimer before saying how to use this, because it's extremely powerful in terms of how you can either help or manipulate someone into doing something.
1:31
And so it's called labeling.
And so essentially and I'll tell you a quick story about how I used it in a non sale situation and you can use it in your life as well.
But labeling is nothing to do with the opposite overcome but it is the Technique that makes it work.
All right and so basically what you want to do is label someone with a positive attribute and then associate that attribute with the action that you want them to take and because people want to reinforce positive attributes that other people see about them.
2:03
They will often associate a reinforced that action by doing the thing that you said.
So for example, if I said to you, It's so, you know, it's awesome, that you've been, you've been crushing the program, you're definitely someone who has lots of work ethic and is in a successful person.
2:23
And because of that, that's why you're always doing your hundred reach out to every day.
That's an example of me, labeling someone with a positive attribute and associating that with an activity, right?
And so people, especially in the relationship you have with them.
And this happened, this works a lot in short context, it's not like you're going to change someone's identity but within the context of a A conversation people want to be consistent with a positive attribute.
2:47
You've labeled them with right and so it works extremely well in selling situations.
And so the example that Chad screener shoe used with, how to overcome the decision-maker, obstacle was really brilliant and use labeling and so it works like this.
3:04
So pay before we get going, do you need to check with anyone?
You know your husband's past Etc to make a decision to help your health?
They're going to say No, I can, I can I can make decisions on my own.
Typically, the beginning to sell, there's low pressure so they just want to move on.
So they'll say yes.
3:19
But once they say that, that's when you drive it in, you say, awesome.
So you're like a strong Confident Woman just like my wife.
I would know I married when she always makes her own decisions.
So that's great.
That you are that way, right?
And so by saying that we didn't just say, okay?
They said yes and then we're moving forward, we take the yes and then we drive it right, you nail it down.
3:41
And so that way it's Baited with who they are.
And so, they want to maintain consistency because people do not like people appearing in consistent in any kind of social situation and so I'll say it again.
You ask them if they're the decision maker, if they have to check with their their dogs Faust, you know their creator Etc.
4:00
Before you know moving forward for their own health, right?
Mind you the tonality you use in the question.
Will dictate how frequently people give you?
Yes, let me give you an example.
And this is why tonality matters with everything, right?
It's not just the words.
It's how you say the words, especially, You when you're selling or the phone, which most people are right now, right?
4:16
Is saying, okay, so you know, you don't need to check with anyone to, you know, move forward with the program for your own health, do you?
So you see how it like your own health emphasize, their do you inflection of the voice at the end?
All right, and so by saying it that way, I'm telling the person with my tone that I want them to say, yes right after they say yes then you drive the point home and say okay?
4:41
Oh awesome.
So you're a strong Confident Woman, you can make decisions for yourself.
Totally appreciate it.
My wife's the same way.
And so, just like that, I also built some Rapport because I drove a bridge between her and some of that I clearly would care about right?
And so just like that, you take it.
You showed them with the tonality of how you ask the question that they need to say.
4:59
Yes.
They say yes.
And then you label them with their identity of having something confident, you know, something positive.
So most women want to be perceived as strong confident, women.
Most women want to be perceived that way and so by giving them that label, they now need to live up to To that label during the conversation, right?
5:16
And so that it's less likely at the end of the call that they will bring it up.
Hey guys, real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
5:31
I'm doing that to build hype four hundred dollar leads, but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers, make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
Its fo free in exchange for your email so that I can email you when we launched under leads and so that you can not miss out.
5:50
Out on it because last time I sold out for like eight straight weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
That being said, if someone brings up the decision maker obstacle at the end of the call, here's the unfortunate thing about sales is that you can't bring up what they said earlier because you don't win sales by making lots.
6:11
You don't win sales by proving someone wrong, right?
If you prove if you if you prove yourself right?
You lose the sale.
So you can either be right or be rich if you've heard of that saying, this is where those things.
Apply the obstacle over him.
Portion of any sale, is a dance, not a fight, right?
I'll make a whole video about that, but Essentially as soon as someone puts their hands up and realizes that this like if your if your tonality shifts it all where they feel like they got you off track or you feel defensive or you have that kind of tonality of like, but you said soon as you say that you're done right?
6:41
They have to feel like it's fluid.
Like they say that like, oh, totally understand.
And so you have childlike curiosity or tonality which is like, oh, why do you think that is right?
Rather than what do you mean, right?
You said earlier, so when you say that you're not going to make went, you might win the point but you're not going to to win the sale.
6:59
And so just remembering that even when you're setting these setting setting, these things up at the beginning of the sale.
Hey, you need to, you know, you need to tell me about the end of the call if you can make a yes or no, if they say, they have to think about it.
Like you can't bring that up or if you do bring it up you can't bring it up directly and say that they're lying because then they feel like their status goes down and they don't want to talk to you, right?
7:17
I'll hang up etcetera.
All right, so it's really important that when you're managing the obstacles at the end of the sale you keep your tonality totally neutral even more more light during that period of time.
So they feel like there's no pressure.
Right?
This is still just a conversation.
This is just a dialogue and you're exploring the reasons of why that may be and, and trying to pull out from them.
7:38
The reasons that you're going to eventually get them to come to their own conclusion about why their husband would support them, right?
Given past experiences of when they have supported them, right?
So you're going to use power, I won't get into the, all the different ways you can overcome spouses.
But I wanted to just talk about that one sales technique which is called labeling, all right?
7:56
You can use it during your pre Fame.
It will help you get more people to the end without bringing that back up.
All right.
So, use that use it in your sales, use it as your second, third line, after the introduction.
Hey, can you make your own decisions tonality right?
8:12
Cool.
Yes.
Got it.
So, you're a strong confident.
Women love it.
My wife's just same way.
I can totally appreciate that.
Boom, and you move on right now.
You've labeled them and then you have a nice pre-frame for the sale.
Alright, so anyways, use that in your sales.
If you, if you're struggling with that specific overcome, I'll make sure tactical things Like this if you liked it, if you do like more stuff like this, like and comment and otherwise have an amazing day.
8:33
I'll catch you guys on the flip side.
All right back.

Good morning, everyone.
It is 4:30 a.m.
Rocking In from downtown Austin or not downtown Austin Suburbia, Austin.
But I need to keep in a creating our new phone sales training, super robust and entertaining for our GLX fines and jib Lords.
0:54
And some I'm very, very excited about how it's coming out.
It's what some of our best stuff.
But while I was going through it, there's this one kind of way.
I phrased something that I really liked and I wanted to share it with you.
Which is one of our, one of our gyms had been really struggling with sales and he gets on the daily call every day, which is why we encourage people to do it where I just coach, all more gems one-on-one and he heard something which was to the to the extent of remember why you're doing this right?
1:24
Remember why you're caring about the customer?
Now, here's where this gets really cool.
He went over whatever over 20 or something and then something switched and he went 54.
Nine right overnight. 04:25 2549 right?
1:41
And this is the one thing that switched and this is how I want to share it with you.
He essentially the person who wins.
So every every sales, the same, right?
And the sale is always made either they sell you or you sell them.
But who is the person who makes the sale, the person who makes the sale is the person who cares the most about the buyer, think about that for a second.
2:04
And so that's the phrasing that I'm using in the training, is the person who cares the most about the buyers interests is the one who will win the sale.
All right, like, this was super profound.
And so, when you're approaching the sale you have to come at it.
2:19
From the perspective of, I care more about this person than this person cares about themself.
And this is what that gym owner was able to flip in his mind.
Was he remembered why I use?
He said, because I give him the term commission Breath, Right?
People can smell whether you're in it for their, for your gender or their agenda.
2:38
Right?
And so if you want to win the sale, you have to come at it from the perspective that I care more about your best interest.
Then you do, right?
You're going to throw these things in my way, but I care about you enough to get us through them, so, we can get to the promised land, which is you getting help, which is why you're here, right?
2:57
And you have to expect that you're going like the sale, is not going to go the way that you imagine your head because people bring all this emotional, baggage to the sale.
And it's a problem that's covered in shame and guilt which, which is a, great, a great way of saying it's not easy to get People to trust you to build rapport.
3:17
So they can actually be real with you.
The moment you're able to get someone to be real with you in the sale.
You've already won this app, right?
Because at the end of the sale, if for some reason, they actually can afford it, which is a very, very, very very, very, very, very, very small percentage of people.
Then you're on the same side of the table with them, and it's like, cool.
3:34
Then, let's actually figure this out together, but you're coming from it from a perspective that they trust that you were acting in their best interest, right?
And so that's ultimately the sale, that's that's being made.
Is that?
At the person needs to trust that you care more about their agenda than they do.
3:52
Think about that's the sale that's being made.
If they believe that you care more about them, genuinely then they care about themselves or have demonstrated care about themselves, then you will win.
And so that's why I see some of our gyms who honestly aren't the most skilled salespeople, but they kill it.
4:14
And I because I know these guys, because there's some guys who were just very process-oriented, they fall the fucking script and they crush it.
Right.
And that's great.
And I know why those people are successful because Successful at everything.
But there's some people who are quote, personality-driven salespeople and these are like the really genuinely kind-hearted, caring people that you can immediately tell from their vibe that they really love Fitness and really love helping people get in shape and lose weight and take control their lives.
4:40
Those people get away with so much lack of skill in the sale, but are able to close because the people believe that they really are acting in their own best interest, right?
Which is why having conviction in your product is so important.
4:55
And so if you can simply have that one reframe before you go into the sale, which is I'm going to approach this from the perspective that this person needs my help, but like actually though, like actually getting them to be like you actually believing that they need your help and that you have to have their true best interest at heart more than they do, which is why if you do genuinely That belief you're going to force them to confront the limiting beliefs, they had Ryan.
5:26
You're like listen like let me be real with you here.
Like do you think that the recent you have been successful is because like you've kind of just like falling off the bandwagon like you've been putting the food in your mouth right?
So that's whose responsibility.
5:42
Is that is that is that your busy schedules?
Is that your husband whose whose responsibility is that, right?
They're like, well, I guess it is mine.
You know, like, right.
And I'm not saying this to be mean to you.
I'm In this because I want to help but this time it's going to be different, right?
And so that way you can break these belief systemically throughout so you can actually help this person.
6:01
All right?
Because sales is just coaching right with an outcome.
That's defined over a period of time.
Emo's, an Asian quick break, just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
All right, so send me a connection request a note.
6:16
Let me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or Layla's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
And so I guess the biggest point that I want to make here is that if you can just think about it from that perspective, this guy had the same script for Miss first you know 25 reps to the the last five of nine that he had right and mind you he made this realization at rep 25 which for some reason is a magical number.
6:47
All right?
But a rep 25 you realized that he just was trying to sell on his agenda and not on the agenda, the other person's and there's sometimes it's a I mean, one of the things that I was Us talking to our sales team about is Advanced salesman, our Advance because they never don't do the basics, right?
7:05
People are defined as Advance because of their outcomes, not because of their tactics.
All right.
Advanced lifters aren't doing different tactics than a novice lifters.
They just lift more weight.
The reason they do it is they've just done it consistently longer, right?
Are there more consistent in general?
They never don't do the basics.
7:21
They always sleep.
They always do the recovery mechanism.
They always eat the macros that they're supposed to hit, right?
It's the same thing with business and Sales like the best.
Salespeople are consistent because they never don't do the basics, the tactics don't change, its just your execution of them, all right?
7:37
And so when I look at professional development so this is a big zoom out but I think it's important when I when I talk to higher level you know entrepreneurs who are at like 10 million, 20 million etcetera and they're like, what do I need to do to that, you know, to get to the next.
Next thing is I see three major breaking points in professional development as an entrepreneur.
7:55
The first is skills, right?
I'll enter the marketplace of Entrepreneurship with no skills.
They have nothing to offer a value.
And so they have to go acquire skills.
And there's far more skills that you need to acquire than you think, right?
You're like, I need to be able to get customers, but, B will get customers is a lot of skills put together, right?
8:13
You have to know how to write copy.
You know, have to know how to create creative.
You have to know how to build landing pages.
You know, have to have to have, to be able to buy in place, traffic, you know, have to know how to nurture leads to get them to show up.
But to both schedule and Shop to a Sales Event, you have to know what type of sales You want to have?
8:28
Is it going to be a presentation?
Is it going to be a sales call?
Is it going to be an in-person appointment?
Is it going to be a two-step set?
Like you have to know what the conversion mechanism going to be a sales page, right?
You have to know the conversion mechanism to be, right?
And then from there, you have to know the actual scripting closing mechanism is not.
8:44
Just the words is how to say the words or the tonality is how you ask the questions, how you confront obstacles, how you overcome them, how to process payments, how it like that, like this?
You know, I mean like the the number of skills Stacks in order to make it, but it's skills is the first Lock right.
8:59
The second block is the character traits to execute the skills, right?
As soon as you have your first, your first box of tools, what separates the people who are really successful from the ones who are just moderately successful is that they have the patience, the endurance the discipline right to execute their skills within a defined way.
9:22
And that is how they are able to consistently.
Grow because they're consistently executing and so it goes from knee.
To acquire skills in the beginning to needing, to acquire character traits, which is why I love the game of Entrepreneurship.
Is that the way that you win consistently evolves, right?
It's literally not just more.
9:38
It's different at every level, right?
And then that's kind of level two.
Is that, you have to develop the character traits to be able to execute the skills.
And then the third is your beliefs, right?
Your beliefs about the world, your beliefs, about the market, your belief about what's possible.
Your tolerance of what is acceptable in your organization from an axe.
9:58
A standpoint of speed a standpoint of excellence and those beliefs are top down.
Those are from you, right?
And so as you move move through, I think it's cyclical, right?
I think it's every level encompasses, all three of those things and you kind of have to spin your way through the three of this things over and over again.
10:18
And the reason it gets difficult is that you still have to maintain the skills, the beliefs, the character traits of the base below before you can get to the next level, where you have New beliefs, new skills, new character traits that need to be developed and that's why I think most people love entrepreneurship.
10:35
Or at least, hopefully you like entrepreneurship, if you're in, it is that it constantly forces you to grow and growth is painful, right?
And so, it's this weird masochistic desire to continue to improve and yet suffer the entire way, but love the process while you're suffering.
10:50
So it's this kind of meta thing.
But anyways, I'll get to deepen that big Point here.
Is that if you're trying to close and you're trying to get your sales team to close the A person who cares?
The most about the buyer will win the buyer cares more about their outcome than you do.
Then they will win if you care more about their outcome genuinely.
11:08
Then they do, they will feel that A and B when you confront their beliefs will see it from a place of genuine care and they will be real with you and then when you get to the clothes they're not going to bring their baggage because you confronted the baggage because you did it from a place of care.
And then they will trust you in the close to take them where they need to go.
11:26
All right, so that's the big point.
Point, that was the big.
That was one of the things that I'm going to be.
I'm putting it to our sales training right now.
Hope you enjoyed this.
If you did drop a like or a comment if you didn't still drop a like or a comment.
Alright anyways have an amazing Thursday.
11:41
I could you guys soon.
Bye.









0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually a pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
Just didn't notice.
You didn't listen, didn't hear them.
Get disengage didn't hear a potential obstacle that they brought up or didn't bring out enough pain to make the the problem agitated or prioritize enough that they would want to buy, Welcome to the Jim Secrets podcast, we talk about how to get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
0:38
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on, everyone?
Hope you guys are having an awesome Friday.
Fantastic phenomenal Friday, pH phenomenal and pH Friday.
Let's get weird.
Okay, so I had to post in one of our groups that said, some people struggling with the I don't have my card on me, overcome saying like, hey, you know, let me just call you back on the card.
1:00
You know, on me right now.
And so, first off, let's just address the big elephant in the room, which is, if that comes up, it means that you probably lost a sale earlier, right?
And you just didn't notice.
You didn't listen, didn't hear them.
Get disengage didn't hear a potential option that they brought up or didn't bring out enough pain to make the the problem agitated or prioritize enough that they would want to buy, right?
1:20
That's probably something that happened earlier on the sale, but if this comes up like, you kind of made your bed, so you got to deal with it.
Okay, so first step, when someone says like, I don't have the card on me.
Like no worries.
I'll wait until you get it you know grab it no big deal and just wait right and so that is because remember like these are these are phones.
1:37
They're at home.
They have a card at home like like it's so funny in person, people are like man, they said I left my card at home.
Now they're at home right there at home.
They have the car.
Right?
They have the card there so you're like no worries.
Always, so you get it right now if they're like, oh well, you know, my husband has the the one that I want to use, right?
1:57
Because it's the only other thing that could say, is like, obviously, they have cards at home.
That would be ridiculous, right?
So it's like, cool, they'll throw that the husband or my spouse has the car that I want to use.
It's like, okay, no worries.
We want, we just get you started with the card you got, right?
And then we can swap it out with your husband's, you know, tomorrow, fair enough.
2:19
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
2:40
And that way you can get a go at now if you've already closed them on you know 300 right.
You didn't close one of the things they needed card but it's like what?
Why don't we just get you started for 49 bucks, right?
We'll just put it out on the car that you have and then we'll swap out the rest of the cards that you want to use fair enough.
And so, that way you have a couple of cards that you can play cards pun intended, cards that you can play when that comes up, all right.
3:01
And then the final down south from there, it's like, well, why don't we just use the car that you've got and I'll just put a, put a two day delay on it.
So it's like you're good, we'll start Thing, like it's normal and then we'll swap it out, okay?
So let's just get you started, we'll put that card down, just call, you know.
3:16
That way you can get in, I'll get you set up with the group.
Let's get you set up when you tradition orientation, Etc, and then on nutrition orientation, we show up.
You can swipe the card with me fair enough, that way.
Like, that's kind of a three step step down if someone says they don't have their card on them so one is wait, second is minimal minimal, minimal down payment and then put the rest on the card They want.
3:38
Third would be Cool.
We'll just start your free and delay, the payment, and then you can swap the card out.
But this way, at least, if I have a card then it means that I can get you started.
Alright, so that's the 3.
Step, 3 downsell, step 4.
I don't have the card on me.
How to address it big picture though, they probably got messed up earlier in the sale.
3:56
We need to bring it out, bring out enough pain or you let them get to the close with some stuff in there.
Back there, emotional backpack that you didn't take out and, and throw out our you, let them, you're trying to get them on the plane when they still had some bombs in the backpack.
All right.
That's it.
Hope that makes sense and use it.
4:12
Talk to you soon.
Bye.
All right.
That's it.
Hope that makes sense and use it.
Talk to you soon.
Bye.









0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else, the ruthless, the clear.
That's what they want.
And the book describes, those people, as the best people to do business with why?
Because there's no deception.
Welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
0:45
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Good morning, everyone.
Happy Wednesday.
Hope you guys are having a great and phenomenal start to your Wednesday.
I wanted to make this for you because this is something that came up on my mind.
And so the title of, this is when people only care about making money, one of the things that happened recently someone was telling me about a friend of theirs, like, yeah, I wanna introduce you this guy, but honestly, like he's just the type of guy that just cares about making money.
1:16
And they were saying it really negatively and I judge my own perception of what this person was saying to me, and I felt relief because in my experience and there's a book about this camera with the name of it is, I think it's winning through intimidation, I think that's what it is or it's a think that's what it is.
1:37
But there's a there's basically a book if you know what it is.
It's talks about three types of people to do deals with.
And it's there's like there's the purse first person that talks about how they're like.
I want to take your Chips.
I'm going to try and make us.
Much money off of you strongly possible as category.
1:52
Number one, the ruthless.
Their clear.
That's what they want.
And the book describes, those people, as the best people to do business with why?
Because there's no deception.
And so one of the things that I feel like I've picked up over the last, I guess, eight nine, ten years, whatever it is that we've been doing.
2:09
This is a, everyone is trying to make money.
Some people are just honest about it, and I can't tell you.
I know this will probably We piss some people off and that's okay, because one of the biggest issues that I can see that people encounter are when they're it's worse to be.
2:29
It's worse to lie than it is to tell the truth about your intent.
Like I guess that's the big point is that most people don't actually have altruistic to intentions.
Most people are here to make a profit and as long as they are providing value to their customers, the ethically feel okay about it, right?
2:45
Like if we just be like 100% real cut the shit for a second, right?
And I like to pronounce loud and clear to my community, like I'm here to make money right?
I am I'm here to provide value and get money in exchange for that.
That's why I do this, right?
3:01
That's why I'm not a non-profit and you could even get into how much CEOs of nonprofits make and I've seen all sorts of shady shit there.
But the whole point is whenever this is the biggest warning sign I can give you of people that to do deals.
With is when someone's like, I don't care, I don't care about the money.
3:19
Boom.
Red flag when someone says that bullshit, everyone cares about the money.
It's all they care about most of the times and the people who lie about it, are the ones that need to be the most.
I don't know.
Afraid is the right word careful.
With all right, my favorite people to deal with in the entire world or like I'm here to make money and I'm like awesome.
3:40
Now we can both just cut to the Chase and talk about what matters to us.
And honestly I've had some of the most Pleasant business dealings with people who are open it up front about, that's what they want to do.
Because then it's like cool.
This is what you get.
This is what I get.
Let's go back and forth and find a way that we can both make money, right?
3:55
And most of the times people who operate from that space, obviously know that, in order to make money, you have to provide value and take care of your customers.
But when people talk about it, backwards and charts are talking to this like altruistic, like I'm only here to help people, you know, like, I like, we have to do this and this, and this, it's just like, I have, I have seen this movie so many times.
4:17
And I've seen this record player, A out.
And I can't tell you every business deal that I would say has try to think virtually every business deal that I've done and I've done a lot of them.
Have ended poorly with the people who started with their values.
4:37
Now, you need to have a line value like a line Mission, and you need to have values that are in place.
The thing is, when someone talks only about their values, most of the time, your values are not actually aligned.
And that's what I found is that type of person in general tends to lie, right?
4:55
And maybe they're lying to themselves, I don't know, but that's like deeper other shit.
But the point is in the book that I'm referencing, God, I can't remember what the name is, but he talks about three types of people.
Write the first one is like that shark, right?
And you just like, I'm here for the money.
I'm going to try and take as many chips from you as I possibly can.
5:11
And that's how this works, right?
Those guys are the best people to do business with because there's honesty up front.
There's the second type of person who's like, I don't care about the money, like, it's really about, you know, doing good and all that stuff and blah, blah, blah, blah, those guys will screw you.
5:28
All right.
Third category, is the type of person who's like listen you know what?
I just value our relationship above everything else.
Like what you know like whether we make this work or not, is it like for me it's really about our relationship and making sure that we can make this into something long-term.
5:44
Boom, Another our flag.
All right, every time and I've heard each of those phrases in different instances and you've probably heard them too, but maybe you haven't had the pattern recognition, which is why I'm so big on this stuff and hopefully these podcasts provide some value for Because sometimes the best deals the deals not made right like Warren Buffett's.
6:04
First rule, don't lose money.
Second rule, don't forget number one, right?
Never lose money.
A lot of times, I think there was another quote, I just read by him recently, words, the people who are super Advanced just to get extremely good at saying, no, right?
Imagine how many deals he gets presented with on a regular basis and he has to say no to 99% of them.
6:25
Can you when presented with 100 opportunity?
Say no 99 times.
People don't have that discipline, right?
And the thing that separates, the people who are really good for the people who are not as good at is the number of mistakes they make in the gravity of the mistakes that they make right.
Charlie, Munger Warren Buffett's longtime business partner says, you never want to bet the farm, right?
6:45
You always want to make you want to make bets, but they want to be controlled, but that if you're wrong, you still can get it back.
And I can tell you the amount of times that IP seen people, especially newer and business, who bet the whole Farm on a relationship.
And when they get super romanticized, super, Cited about they're like, oh this person just loves what I love and like, no, we would never have any issues like we just get along.
7:04
So well.
Boom, red flag, right?
I think sometimes the best deals are with people that you don't necessarily even like that much but you're clear and sometimes not liking someone like on a personal level, not disliking them being like you know we both are a little different but you know, we've come to both provide value to this relationship, right?
7:23
In an economic sense.
Money-wise sometimes, my best relationships in business, don't have been people like that.
That because everyone's clear.
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
7:40
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I guess a partner with you.
7:57
So that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
And I think that's like, that's the, the underlining like notion that I found is.
There just has to be absolute blunt.
Transparency.
And so a lot of times when I'll enter like negotiation, things like that.
8:15
It's like, this is what I want from this.
Like, if we can't get there, that's not a big deal for me.
I just want to be very upfront.
This is what I want, right?
And so now mind you in negotiations, want to get the other person to talk first because you can understand what they're doing but but like you should be clear in your intentions when you're going into it and sugar coating and saying like I'm here for the puppies and the rainbows and all that stuff.
8:37
And I'm just here for for our Long term and that's what I always want to put our relationship first.
I cannot tell you how many times I've been stabbed in the back with that.
Say, cannot tell.
You cannot tell you the amount of times that I've been stabbed and fucked because of that, all right?
8:53
And so if the ultimate goal of the entrepreneur is to learn pattern recognition and be able to make better decisions.
Because the only thing that separates you now from you five years ago, is your beliefs in your ability to make decisions, right?
Obviously you've skills and this one will not that's with that, but all of that goes into your how well you can make decisions, right?
9:16
Warren Buffett starts over tomorrow, Bill Gates.
Start over tomorrow.
Whoever it is right, whoever your guy is that they start over tomorrow, they're able to recreate everything because they understand the pattern of decision-making that they got them to where they were right.
And so if you can install that pattern, like humans are the only people on Earth that don't have to learn by doing.
9:35
We can learn by watching other people do and learn from them, its speed.
Up your curve of moving up the ladder, right?
You can learn from other people's mistakes, you learn from other people's principles and so sometimes the best deals are the ones not made.
And so I just want to give you just a few red flags, that hopefully will help you avoid massive destruction in your life.
9:56
So one, if someone presents someone else - Lee is this guy only cares about money.
I would be more worried about the person who says that that I would have it be about the person who supposedly was claimed only care about money when you enter.
The relationship be abundantly.
Clear about what?
10:12
Where the money is.
All right.
It's business and so just don't mistake it for anything else.
Everything else is just is just Superfluous.
Everything else is smoking mirrors.
All right, is bullshit.
Get down to the bottom line of like, what's in it for you?
10:28
What's in it for me?
All right, obviously, we have to provide value, right?
To one another in order for this to work.
But just like just cut all the extra fluff out and I can't Are you the people who are rub Wrong by that?
Good riddance.
All right, they're not the type of people you want to deal with and if they really are the super, super super altruistic.
10:50
People, some of the absolute worst people to do business with.
If they really, really do believe all that stuff.
Absolute worst why they're super emotional?
They're incredibly reactive just in my experience and this is obviously a sweeping generalization, but like you can probably recognize that personality type and And that's why I don't do well with certain audiences, right?
11:12
The people who are super like crunchy, you know, granola E-Type people are just rubbed really wrong by me and that's okay because it's not.
It's never going to work out because we just have such different ways of doing things.
But those types of people tend to be overly emotional in their decision-making processes.
11:33
And then they also are really, really difficult to deal with an ongoing basis when you're coming together.
So, Big steps back.
Brutal honesty about who's making?
What?
And what your intentions are with money being first.
Okay.
Second be extremely, extremely weary.
11:52
Big red flags when someone says they want to just value your relationship you and them more than anything else, big red flag.
If they say, they don't care about the money.
They're really just in this for the goodness, bullshit, big red flag.
All right.
And then, and then between all of This stuff like you like, man.
12:12
Alex.
How do you, how do you make it deals?
Think about business deals, a lot of times like marriages, right?
And I think, if you think about like that, it's like, man, that means like, I'm a lot like most of them work out.
Yeah.
Because that's kind of like dating, right?
It's very, it's very difficult to create sustained long-term deals because business has changed markets, change, Etc constantly, right?
12:35
And so just most times saying no is the Call.
And if you if you do see someone who starts talking about money, talking about money first, I would encourage you to peel back some of the societal given beliefs about what that says and be grateful that the person is being honest.
12:56
And then you can have clear expectations and outcomes from one another.
A lot of times to my best business relationship is deals have come from those types of situations.
So do the provide value for you?
Hope you hopefully that'll get you to say, no to somebody who said that stuff.
Cough.
And then the finally, that type of person is the super, super super altruistic person.
13:16
They should just stay in the nonprofit world and not get into the business world, because they're just in my experience way too emotional in general and just very difficult to deal with the wrong, I'm going basis.
Cough.
And then the finally, that type of person is the super, super super altruistic person.
They should just stay in the nonprofit world and not get into the business world, because they're just in my experience way too emotional in general and just very difficult to deal with the wrong, I'm going basis.

Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
0:17
So even though you get permission to open back up, it doesn't mean that you're necessarily to have the profit to be able to do so.
Welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer.
And the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
0:33
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Go on everyone, welcome back.
So I want to make this video because I in our community was talking yesterday about the math behind how to know how many sessions you should have as your reopening to make sure that you are profitable.
0:49
So one of the big issues that's going to come up is a lot of different states, have different recommendations.
Some of them are based on percentage of capacity, you know, reopening through covid.
Some of them are Are, you know, limited to 10 people or it's the greater of the two or the lesser of the two, excuse me.
And so what that does is it creates a lot of issues for most gyms because The Profit model is not built for large group training to not be able to do large group training, all right?
1:17
And so what I mean by that is if you're charging, let's say, five dollars a session or ten dollars a session for what it would work out to in terms of the attendance for your hundred dollar-a-month clients, if you're only able to have 10 people per session at your facility that would include you and probably one other person so now you're down to eight.
1:36
Now if you're providing one on eight service it doesn't make monetary sense for Or you to be in business, right?
So even though you get permission to open back up, it doesn't mean that you're necessarily going to have the profit to be able to do so.
So if you were to go home back to your full client schedule, when you come back, you probably won't be profitable.
1:57
And so this is how you reopen the right way?
Okay.
So there's two main components of this and I'll go through each one as in-depth as I can, all right?
The first is what I was mentioning just now.
If you're only able to have 10 people per session, then you need to price your services at the price that that service would be normally offer.
2:17
So if people are normally paying 129 a month at your facility or 150 a month or whatever for unlimited and you're only able to have 60 people a day, your gym.
If you had six sessions a day, for example, those sessions you can't even have 60 because you're going to be included in that.
2:34
So now you're talking, you know, 50 people a day that you can service which means you can only serve 50 customers.
All right, so if you're having a one on eight scenario, then you need to charge 300 or $400 a month for that service as long as it happens.
Now here's the good news, the people who will want to come back.
2:52
We're going to be itching to come back.
Not everyone is going to come back but the people who do want to come back desperately, want to come back and so they'll likely you'll have to supply demand curve in your favor.
Meaning there's more people who want you then there is the availability of time for you to be able to train clients, all right?
And so when you have supply and demand in your favor, That means you can increase your price, right?
3:11
And so those things work together for kind of scenario one.
Okay.
If you are limited and can't do like that many people per session etcetera.
Okay, you need to adjust your price to reflect the level of service being provided.
Not just letting people back into their old price because it doesn't make monetary sense.
3:28
Okay, now what I'm going to do is talk about the second piece, which is how do I know?
And it makes monetary sense.
So one of the things in the gym on Secrets, book in section 2, which is the profit levers, I would highly encourage you to read before you reopen because it allow you to fix everything that you did wrong in your gym.
3:44
This is one of the biggest opportunities all time for people who own a gym because right now, Society is giving you permission to change all these things in your gym at once, and then restart the right way, with the right price points, the right hours, the right amount of people per session.
4:00
All of those things done, right?
So that you can maximize the profit and capacity facility.
All right?
So this is like, never before.
Will you be able to get this opportunity?
So, take it, please take 35 minutes and read section 2 of the gym on Secrets book.
It's free, plus shipping.
Go read it.
4:16
All right.
Now, here's the, here's one of the biggest pieces that I have to provide for you.
Okay.
You want to make sure that you're making an 80% gross margin minimum on your services.
All right.
This is, this has been a rule of thumb that we've used to Jim launch forever.
4:32
If you are running on that, then you will be able to make a profit and have a good business.
If you do not and you're like, well we're at 75.
I'm telling you every percentage Point makes an enormous difference.
So let me give you an example.
If the average Jim is running on 12 and a half percent margins per year, all right, that's the average.
Jeb, if you go from 75 to 83 percent margins then you added eight percent to your bottom line.
4:54
If you were from 12 to 20, that would be a very big deal, right?
If you're almost twice as much money.
So these percentage points matter, alright?
So for us now mind you you can set the number whatever you want.
My rule of thumb is minimum 8.
If you want to be 85 or 90 by all means, go for it.
5:10
All right.
You can see it's your business.
You can set it up the right way, but let me walk through a simple math example, to explain to you exactly how many sessions you can know by math that you can reopen at any given moment.
Okay.
So if you have, let's say 150.
Customers before this and then you reach out to all of them and only 100 want to come back.
5:27
Cool.
So let's say those hundred who have said, yes.
I want to come back and build my card now.
All right our Billing at $100 a month, I don't recommend that price point but I'm saying if that is what they are saying, then that's what we're going to work off of for the for the money math.
All right.
So that's ten thousand dollars.
5:42
A month of recurring Revenue that you have built in.
Now, if you're running an 80 percent gross margin, that means that on the cost of delivering the services that doesn't include rent.
That doesn't include admin.
It doesn't include Getting just your hard cost of fulfilling a session.
5:57
All right, is 20 percent or less of what you are, paying our, what you are making, okay?
So what that means is, if you're making ten thousand dollars a month for your services, then it should cost, you $2000 a month or less to fulfill those services.
6:14
So, if we know that we only have two thousand dollars that's earmarked for payroll for fulfillment of those services.
And you know it cost you $20 per session.
It means you have a hundred sessions that you're able to fulfill on per month.
Now, if we're going to be smart about this, then we're going to divide our hundred sessions by 4.3, which is how many weeks there are per month on average, which means we have 23 sessions per week, that you're going to be able to fulfill.
6:41
All right?
Given the number of people and the amount of Revenue that's being brought in, that is already happening.
I don't go off of promises.
I'm begging, you go off of reality.
Hey, if you're a return listener and you have not rated or reviewed the show, I want you to know that you should feel absolutely terrible about yourself and everything else in the world kidding.
7:03
But it would mean the absolute world to me.
If you guys would go ahead and do that, you don't have to pause the show, you keep listening and you can just do with your thumb right now will take you less than 60 seconds.
And like I said, the only way that podcast grows through word of mouth and this is you joining hands with me and helping as many isomers of possibly can because no one is coming to save us, it's just us.
7:19
All right, so please go do that now.
Then let's get back to the show.
All right, you're going to have like some people's cars won't go through because things have changed over the last two months.
Some people say they're going to come back and then don't some people are like, actually got away from my kids, blah, blah, blah.
All right.
Go only off of reality go off of what goes through.
7:38
So, you get everyone in, you start their billing and then you see what happens.
And then you dictate the schedule, right?
If you can do that, if you can't you're going to have to down, ask downgrade your estimation by how much you were making before with all the cancellations included.
And then drop another 10%, just in case and then use that as the number two bases.
7:55
Us off of.
So ten thousand dollars, two thousand dollars for payroll.
That means if we're getting $20 a session that's a hundred sessions, we divide that as per month by the number of weeks in a month which is four point three.
So we have 23 sessions per week, okay.
8:12
And so you can allocate those, let's say that we've got five days a week, Monday through Friday, that might be normal hours.
All right, so on those days, let's say we did four sessions day, two in the morning, two in the afternoon.
So now we got 20, we got three left over and so we can Three on Saturday right in the morning if that's what we wanted to do, right?
8:29
And so just like that, you can get your payroll and you can get your business to a point where you have an 80% gross margin or higher, right?
And so like I said, that is the minimum but that is the way that you can know in your gut that you're opening up in a position to be profitable.
8:46
Now, if you've done the math and you're like, you know what, I can only have ten thousand dollars a month recurring and my red is 6.
Well then you're probably not going to start a profitable.
Anyways, and so at that point, you're gonna have to make hard decisions of like, do I want to do, want to do a big presale and then get another 50 or 100 people pre-sold on a trial to, to be able to monetize this.
9:07
And that's where cash is really important, right?
But big picture, most of you don't have that situation and if you did have that kind of read that.
Hopefully, your revenue is higher than that.
Hopefully, your price is higher than that etcetera, but that's how you, that's how you can figure this out and most people do this wrong.
9:22
Most people are like, I'm trying to open up as many available time.
Right?
Or the worst scenario you can have is in this is what I feel like is going to happen for a ton of people is I'm going to be limited to 10 people per session.
I've got 100 clients, I'm going to increase my overhead so that I can have 10 sessions a day.
9:38
So I can see all my clients and there goes your margin forever.
And then, how do you transition back and having to cut sessions, right?
It's not a good way to do it.
Start as little as you can start with two sessions, a start with 90 percent margins right?
That's fine.
9:53
It's okay.
Start with Ninety percent margin to work at two sessions a day and work your way back.
Start at three sessions a day.
Whatever.
Right.
And so, from there, this is one of those beautiful opportunities that if you ever had that session, that never really had good attendance, right?
Cut it right, cut it, get your margin back right?
10:10
And like I just want everyone like think covid.
Like sure.
There are things that you probably wish didn't happen, Okay?
But, but take what you can right?
Right now, you can click reset on your business.
These are the five things that you need to do right now.
All right?
I'm going to The cliff notes on what you need to do one, you need to switch from unlimited to two or three times a week.
10:30
Is your main offer, all right, because right away, that will double or triple Your Capacity to you.
Need to switch your billing to a weekly Cadence.
Now, just have to actually be weekly, but it has to be on a weekly bi-weekly or four times every for we Cadence.
Why?
Because if you do it on every 28 days, you're going to get 13 billion a year instead of 12, which means you get an extra almost 8% and top-line revenue for the same amount of service.
10:53
Right?
What that means is if You have 12 percent margin, you know, a percent now, you're 20.
All right, almost doubles how much you make just from that one change.
All right, each of these levers is like that.
Okay, so I'm limited to two to three times a week.
You're going to switch to a billing Cadence of weekly, bi-weekly, or 28-day Cycles.
11:13
You're going to change your pricing to match your service.
All right, which means when you make these adjustments, typically when you limit people sessions fewer, people show up which then means that the number of people per session goes, Which means your value goes up and so that means that you can build more, believe it or not because people change it changes the value, proposition to the end user.
11:33
So just remember that you're not cutting sessions, you're adding value by making it more personalized because the club, the sessions are going to be smaller and more controlled, okay?
And there's only do that.
My minimum recommendation is 167.
All right, that's my minimum bare.
Minimum bear, bear, bear bear, bear minimum, which works out to thirty nine dollars a week.
11:51
All right, bare minimum most people will be at 49 a week or 59 a week or 69 week.
Okay.
And that's what you can do for those.
And that's what the overall pricing would be.
So if you did it at $49 a week before, T 999, don't forget your 99 Cents.
All right, which means you're gonna be one 9999 every 28 days.
12:11
All right, beyond that, if you typically have exercise is that you use that you've wanted to get rid of, because they take too much space up and they eat too much square footage.
This is the time to get rid of those things and take them out of the program.
In terms of your sessions, instead of being 60 Minutes, cut into 45, all right.
12:31
It will also increase your capacity and decrease your payroll.
So, all of these things are things that you can do right now doing it, the right way, starting with the right price with the right Services, the right amount of sessions, the right margin, so that you can actually come out of this profitable or even more profit than you did before.
12:50
Every person who goes in and tries to increase the amount of sessions they're doing, keep the pricing, the same.
And Then have more individualized service that they're going to do is going to go out, right?
The math doesn't support it and so just like if I can give you one thing, just trust the math, right?
13:05
You will be able to make a profit go to provide more value to your customers and actually, get through this.
You can grow your gym, which hopefully is your goal.
So, that's, that's, that's part one of how to reopen the right.
Way is structure everything properly.
I'll probably make another video on how to Market and sell before that, but right now, make sure to get this stuff right.
13:25
Right?
If you get the book, there's a letter inside the book on how to communicate the changes.
You can literally copy it.
Go for it, my gift to you.
Yeah, if you don't know where the book is, just go to Alex's, book.com there's a free book there.
I think it's on Amazon to.
If you do, by the way you review, lots of love anyways.
13:42
Happy Wednesday.
Want to make sure I got that for you and keeping awesome.









0:00
What's going on, everybody?
I'm bringing some more books, but I wanted to say that, if you haven't checked out Hunter million-dollar offers, I would definitely suggest that you start there.
I've gotten some solid feedback and it couldn't be happier with its.
Number one ranking on Amazon for direct marketing and over 5,000, five star review.
So, thank you guys so much for that.
0:15
It's 164 pages.
I really can help you out.
It takes about four hours to get through, check it out.
On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
The audiobook is Lowe's, they'll let me put it on for it, so I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
They're like, man.
These guys just expect me to sell all day and the answer is yes.
0:35
Welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on, everyone?
Hope you guys have an awesome Monday morning.
0:54
I wanted to make this because I woke up with this on my mind and I think it was relevant.
So I was looking through our, our weekly reports and I was looking at the sales team stuff and I was looking at the jail, like stuff which is our film inside and I thought this was really fascinating and I would share this with you.
So, one of the things that happens is we get a lot of people who come on and they say, you know, we're like, hey, what's your goal right now?
1:15
What are you trying to accomplish, right?
And a lot of gyms are like, man.
If I could get three, Hundred members, that would be amazing.
Like, 200 members of The Amazing.
I've got 500 members.
I would be amazing, right?
And so you have these goals, right?
And yet they don't follow the simple math of getting there.
And so most times the inflow is the cap.
1:33
Right now, there's obviously you've probably heard if you've ever followed my stuff for long enough, you'd know that I talk a lot about retention about lifetime value Etc, right?
But at a basic level, there there is at some point what I would consider acceptable metrics, right?
1:49
What that means is, let's say that you're you know, if you're in the service based business, you're never going to get your turn below 1% to.
I mean, it's just it's very unlikely, right?
And that's, and if you are in that, it's typically because you're growing purely off organic referrals, which is awesome.
2:05
But if you want to be massive, you need to grow off everything you need to go off organic, you need to go off out bounding to grow off, paid acquisition right running ads and the issue that I just continue to see is, and so then, so this last week I think we had like Jim's pause on, GL, X into G Alexa's are kind of done for you side and all ten of them paused because there was too much inflow, they could not handle the lead flow and the appointments that were being set for them.
2:35
And I'm going to pause that right there and Layla was on a podcast this last week as well with think it's push press.
I think it's push press.
And the co push press was like, you know, we've we've heard that the No one complained that that we hear from people, you know, from our customers who have worked with you, is that they're like, man, these guys just expect me to sell all day and the answer is yes because that's what you said you wanted, right?
3:02
And so it's interesting for me is most people want a full gym until they actually have a full gym or see what's required to get a full gym, right?
And so when we used to fly out and forced him to grow, because we didn't have limiting beliefs around growing a gym, someone would have 80 clients at their CrossFit and then in 21 days, they'd 280 client at their CrossFit and they'd be like, holy shit.
3:24
What do I do?
I did not sign up for this.
It's like actually, you did sign up for this and so reminds me I'm going to pull this up for you.
My favorite, my favorite Magic parts of all time.
All right was called burning wish so dr.
Cash you sent me a card versus really cute of him and underneath it says she wished for a weapon but for not the skill.
3:44
Sorry she wished for a weapon but not for the skill to wield it and I feel like a lot of times that's That's what happens is at least for the people who are coming in to GLX underprepared, is there like I really want to grow.
I want to get new customers, right?
Our top client right now in the last 30 days, sine of 100 and 130 new clients, all right, 130 and we actually that's in the last 30 days, but she signed up 130 in the last two and a half weeks.
4:12
So if we give it another like one and a half weeks, she'll probably top 200 new clients.
All right.
If you want a 200 300 400 500 person facility and you are not able to sign up 20 new clients a week.
4:29
You will not get there, right?
Because this is where the acceptable metrics Parts comes in.
I would like to give you permission that if you have a service-based business, alright Services of any kind.
Anything that is easy in is easy out and you're like, well I mean we have to onboard them and bought what you should be right, but easy in service is easier switching from your CRM to another CRM.
4:54
Not easy, right?
Big pain in the ass and so the likely that you switch is very very low which is why software and things like that or much stickier than services are.
And so you have to kind of accept that that comes with the territory.
So if you're selling service and you want to be big, then you have to know that there's going to be a back ensuring that's going to occur.
5:14
And that's just because easy in Easy out, that's how it works, right?
But if you have easy in and you're not maximizing, the fact that that's your advantage and services that you can scale quickly, write your inflow.
Then you're not using one of the primary advantages of being a service provider, right?
5:31
And so it's like, I want to get to to 200.
Or let's say, let's say, let's say 300 members, right?
I want to get to 300 members.
Okay cool.
You want to get 300 members.
Now your turn 10% industry, average.
And you can only sign up 10 trials week and that's you maxed out right 10 new prospects per week.
5:50
They give you a credit card for some front-end program or a trial of some sort, right?
You can only sign up ten of those a week.
Now, even somebody who comes in and signs up straight into EFT, what we have noticed is we still have to resell them on a longer term because really there's the I'm going to try it phase and then there's the I'm going to commit phase and even if like I said, you sign someone up for Recurring.
6:11
It doesn't actually mean they'll stick until they really make the second sale.
And we've seen that across the board for us and our gyms at least, okay?
So if you can only take on ten new new potential prospects right per week and that's your cap and you want to get to 300 members, then that would mean that you have to convert 75% of them week in week out.
6:31
And a lot of people are not doing that.
And 10 mind, you means that you're closing. 50% of four calls a day, right?
That our show, And let's say you're getting half those calls, which means you have to have eight scheduled appointments today.
Now, most gyms that I talk to don't even have they're stressed out of their mind with that, right?
6:52
But that's just for them to get 20 or 30 new, customers a month, you want to get to 500, you want to get to 400, you have to accept the fact that you're going to be selling all day because you are selling a service and you're trying to get to a high number.
And so most times, most times people have goals and are disconnected from the genes that are required to get there, right?
7:13
The numbers, the basic math, and most people just don't do the math.
Like so I would highly encourage you.
If you note your turn is Look Backwards and think, okay, if I'm going to lose 20 customers month and I'm at 200 and I want to get to 400 a lot of times, you don't just double your info, like sometimes you have to do even more than that because you also lose some efficiency on the back.
7:34
It's part of the game, right?
And so if you're at temperature, you're losing 20, all right.
And so if you know you're converting half of your trials, that means you have to make 40 sales a month.
All right, the industry average, by the way is 35%, which would mean that if you wanted to replace those 20, you have to sell 60, trials a month, okay?
7:50
Of some sort 60 front and programs of some sort per month.
If you can't do that, you will never grow.
And you will always wonder why, all right?
And so this message is basically, for anyone who wants to be a big dog, if you want to dominate the market, which is the marketing that most people respond to like dominate your competition, blah, blah, blah, all that kind of stuff, right?
8:13
You want to be a seven-figure gym?
Okay, cool.
Then you have to do the math.
That seven-figure Jim's do and I do not know a single one of Them that do not know how to take on high numbers of traffic on a week in week out basis.
Right.
8:28
What I continue to see is I'm going to turn my ads on for a couple weeks and I'll turn them off and then we gotta go service.
Those people know know, if you want to scale your inflow never stops.
You have to be able to sign up people this week and next week, and the week after that.
And the week after that, and fulfill you need to be doing both things.
8:46
Concurrently and if you're incapable of doing that, it means you're not able to manage your schedule.
Of your team, right?
They have to know that the first two hours of the day it's blocked on their time is going for a pound for ongoing fulfillment, like they're reaching out to your existing customers, to make sure that they stay then you have two hours a day, that's blocked for onboarding for new customers.
9:05
Then you have orientations, right, all that sets and then you have sales and you have to disperse the meetings that have to happen in order to make this entire model work.
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
9:21
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that, you mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
9:44
Right?
And that's with any service business like this works.
The same for us, right?
We've got sales appointments, we have kickoff calls, we have builds that happen in the background and then we have ongoing check-ins to make sure the clients are doing well right beyond that.
We still have daily calls with me to make sure that they're being able to sell and convert and all that kind of stuff, right?
10:03
And so the whole point of this is if you're not where you want to be a lot of time it's because your inflow is your bottleneck and you have an operationally prepared yourself for What it actually looks like to sign up. 100 people in a month, right 50, 60, 80 new people and I'ma the math is there.
10:21
If you want to do it you can do it.
But I'm just seeing this, like, more times than not and the, like, when when dancing in for a surprise that the number one complaint that people got from Jim monsters.
Like they're just, they just flood.
You know, they flooded me with Lee.
They expected me to sell a date.
10:37
Yeah, because that's what you said you wanted.
So either switch your goal or switch your head.
It right like because like if you want to get to here, it's just math backwards, right?
And so just most people have not done that math.
So here's how you do the math.
10:54
If you want to grow to, let's say 300 members, okay?
And let's say, your turn is 10 percent.
That means you need to sign up 30 people per month to break even.
Now let's just get those 30 done.
11:09
Let's say you convert half because to get the 300, you have some skills, right?
So you're converting Half your front and people, which means you're at 60 new signups per month.
That's 15 a week.
All right, now, if you're selling one out of two, that you're that you're talking to.
Now, you're talking 120 a month of people who you're talking to F.
11:28
So that's 30 a week, roughly right now, you're talking to, and you're probably selling only five days.
Or now, here's another way, I could go off on its own, we only sold two days.
A week is like, well, good luck trying to sell, you know, 30 people in two days.
It's not good.
It's very unlikely.
That's going to happen, right?
So if you're not set, let's say your son.
11:44
In six days and your son 30, you guys, so five people a day, I'm sorry, meet with five people per day, which is not that unreasonable.
It's five.
Thirty minute sessions is two, and a half hours, three hours of sales a day, like this is not crazy right now.
You're still going to have show-ups, right?
Which is going to be another inefficiency, alright?
12:00
So the go 30 goes to 60 appointments a week.
Whoo.
Interesting.
All right now we're at 60 appointments a week and we're just maintaining 300 we're not even growing to get there yet.
Interesting.
Right, and so now we're seeing how this mouth starts to work out.
12:17
I like, okay, so now if I wanted to grow an extra 30 on top of that, they needed to have even more of needed, double what I just said, okay?
And so we have 30 conversions from 60 front, end sales, which is half of 120, meetups 120 client conversations per month, okay?
12:39
That and then you have half of those that show for their appointments.
And then you need to double that to grow, right?
That's the math.
And so if you're not able to deal with that math, then you will not get there.
And sometimes it's just like just giving the sheer reality of the situation is like it's a volume game, its a math game, it's the same people who get bent out of shape.
13:02
Over one person who says, I got to talk to my husband.
I don't have my card on me.
It's like cool.
Move on.
Champions have short memories, right.
They bounce back Us.
They're unaffected by losses because they're just thinking I know.
I need to close half, which means here's the news flash.
13:20
If you have to meet with 200 people, 100 people are going to say, no and you have to be emotionally, okay?
With that because you just understand the numbers right now, but I don't know.
I mean, you should try and get better at your craft always, of course, right?
But if you just can't accept emotionally and this is what I continue to see is that some guys just can't take the emotional beating of having people say, no.
13:42
No, which is why they'll never grow, right?
And like the most experienced salespeople, they don't get bothered.
They're like, yeah, they understand that people come with their own preconceived notions to the call.
It's a not about you.
The salesman.
It's about them.
Right?
And just remembering that it's about them.
13:58
So don't get butthurt.
If for some reason, someone says no, of course they have excuses.
That's why they're not in shape, of course, they've limiting beliefs.
That's why they're not in shape and so if we're going to expect that they're not going to come with emotional baggage that call or to the meeting.
It's ridiculous, right?
And so then if we're to take this back one step, right?
14:16
And we said, let's say 240 consoles.
We're going to have to be generating 15 leads a day, right?
Roughly huh?
Well, what is the take to get 15 leads a day in cost?
Well right let's back into it. 15 leads a day.
Ten bucks a weed or $150.
14:32
It's 4500 dollars in Aspen per month.
Just a mess.
And I think that a lot of people don't confront them at.
They make these goals and don't think about what it takes to get there and then as soon as it even gets to a third of what it would actually take to get there to achieve what they want.
14:48
They're like, oh my God, this is just so much so we'll yeah, if that's what you want.
Then this is how this is how it works.
It's like why I Want To Be A Champion body builder.
Okay, well, I can only work out 3 days a week for an hour.
Okay, good luck.
Okay, right.
15:05
And so It's like, Do You Want To Be A Champion?
Or do you just want to be another person who also ran and that's fine.
If that's what you want.
It's just I'm not hearing that, that's what you want.
So either people need to get real clear on what they really want or and, and and then make the adjustments accordingly or realize that it's not actually their priority.
15:25
And I could go into a whole nother thing about like priorities are just priorities, there's never really conflicting, priorities, you just have one that is a bigger priority than another.
And if it conflicts, then the other one is a secondary priority.
And sometimes priorities do conflict in terms of their nature, but not their importance.
And so you just need to figure out which of these things is more important to me, right?
15:43
And most times, it's simply being able to delegate time and appropriate on a calendar when things need to get done.
If we know that we have to onboard 30, new customers per week, then how do we fit?
Let's say 30, 30 minute consultation zit, okay, that's 15 hours a week.
16:02
I've got one team member there here, five days a week.
There's three hours on their own On their calendar.
Great.
So now that one person has three hours a day on their calendar, five days a week for taking on new customers.
Okay, that seems reasonable.
They still have another five hours, right?
And if they have to do conversion meetings, which is to convert them into a long-term membership from a trial or a funding program.
16:23
Now, from from those people, we know that we again, have 30 people, we got to meet with and so of those 30 people and it's the say it's going to take a 30.
It's a 30-minute console to sell someone to membership.
Boom, now that That six hours a day.
All right, this is just one employee.
16:39
And so this one employee is now managing the onboarding and the conversion sales, right?
And then they have two hours a day to do continues, reach out to the existing customers.
Great.
That is a roll, right?
And then you have a sales person who's going to what I mean there has to be a full time.
Sales person is going to hit those numbers, right?
16:56
They're going to meet with 60 people write, 60 people six days a week.
It's 10:00 today, right?
30 minutes.
So only five hours, right?
And so if you're looking at this, this is the game.
Mmmmm is.
How long does it take?
How many of them do?
We have block the time and that is how you scale.
17:12
That's it, that's all there is, right?
And just and just confronting the math.
Now, you can try and tweak it in control, but you have to understand, you're not going to have orders of magnitude Improvement, you're not going to sell a hundred percent of people who show up and I get to keep 100% of people a month over month.
It just doesn't happen, right?
17:28
It's just, it just doesn't.
And so you have to you deal with what is, right?
You're always going to try to improve and that's normal, but if you wait for, Always your improvements.
You will never start and you will never get to where you're trying to go.
And so that is my message for the week is that your inflow is probably your bottleneck and there has to be acceptable metrics that you can extrapolate off of and then work backwards into how much time that's required and how many people required to help you get there.
17:53
And if that means for you, is the proprietor, the owner of the business that you need to work double time in order to afford the person who's going to be able to release the bottleneck.
Then that is part of the game.
Alright.
So anyways, I hope you guys have an amazing Monday.
I hope you look at Othello gilja, time math, to figure out, how you gonna break your bottlenecks.
18:09
So you can get to the gym that you want whether that's Corona or not Corona or remote or launching anything, or you have a bead B2B business.
It doesn't matter.
The metrics for all the same.
All right, so lots of love, hope you guys are stoked for this week because I am we're super excited and I will catch you guys all soon.
18:27
All right.
Bye.









0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else, anger is weakness.
Des neutrality is strength, empathy is the strongest, welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
0:44
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on a grown-up?
You guys are having a phenomenal Friday.
I wanted to make a little video for you podcast for you about a conflict that I recently encountered.
1:00
And it was something that was really interesting for me to go through and, you know, in in retrospect and I wanted to give you kind of the result of the conversation.
I had with a friend of mine, an old friend of mine, who's a PhD in Psychology, he spent two years or three years.
1:18
Ears being the Frontline Suicide Hotline pick up person and when I say this guy just has like skin thick as you know, bulletproof, whatever.
Something, you know Kevlar.
I mean it and the kind of person that like if you were to point a gun at him, he would probably just like, light a cigarette and be like.
1:36
So what about this makes you feel powerful and like, you know, he's that kind of guy who's G.
So anyways, I was having this conversation and I had a long I'm vendor call up in raged.
I mean, belligerent with rage and I had truly no idea what they were talking about and they thought that we had stole some sort of Ip from them and it was something that it was literally free on the internet that they were giving away.
2:05
And so I was like, what is going on?
Like I had no idea why they were calling that we couldn't even get a word in edgewise like, literally like shouting at the top of their voices, just calling us.
Like, I'm going to finish you.
And you're like, wow, okay, there's some things that you need to do Now, what was interesting for me, was to see how I looked back on how I handled that.
2:23
So I called my friend up and I was like, what do you say in these situations?
Like how do you deal with this?
And I figure.
This is just an extreme example of kind of how we encounter conflict in conversation with employees and sometimes even conversations with prospects, right?
2:38
Because sometimes like, whenever you have this like feeling this pit in your stomach, a lot of times, it's just adrenaline right, cortisol.
It's like kicking in and so he said something to me that Was really simple and profound.
He's like, if you have a gun pointed at you, this is the frame.
He's like, is that what was going on?
2:54
I was like, no, he's like, oh, it was like he, like you look like laughing.
It was like, you know, God pointed edges like that.
That's like the easy stuff, right?
It's just hilarious.
And so, he's like there's three frames, right?
He's like, anger is weakness, he's like, neutrality is strength.
3:11
Empathy is the strongest and I was incredibly proud of myself because I tend to be an escalator I'm not I'm usually like it's just so it's my face like I usually ask late and so I was actually super proud of myself for like not escalating this conversation and trying to maintain neutrality and ask questions.
3:30
Like what do you mean by that?
I don't understand rather than being like you know why?
I won't even say what I would have said back but it's okay.
Point is that has been really helpful for me, having that conversation with him and thinking about how I deal with employees and how I deal with a prospect and it kind of Perverts back to what we talked about in sales, where I mean you've heard me say, Rapport wins Wars number one.
3:54
You've probably also heard me say that I think one or two podcasts to go and this has been repeated in our community, the person who cares the most about the buyers interest wins the frame, right, which is another way of saying.
If you can truly empathize, empathize care about the other person understand where they are coming from, you have the strongest frame, you will always win.
4:17
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, Right?
4:38
And so, when I think about that in Conflict, if I like I'm trying to rewire my brain with this, so maybe this will be useful for you, but I'm just sharing what I'm like, actively working on in my own head.
Is if someone comes at me and they're upset where I have somebody on the phone and they get angrier, they seem offended to instead because my my goal was to be neutral like, my life goal in Conflict, was just remain to neutral, but he just like escalated the game for me is like, oh, no.
5:03
Like empathy is the, is the strongest frame and I was like, God, I hadn't even thought about Caring about what they thought, like, I'm trying to just not be angry, you know, but it's just been, like, it's been really interesting for me to think about it from that perspective.
And you can probably think of times right now in your life where you were, maybe angry or, or lash back, and maybe neutrality was like, the only thing you get to, but you can imagine the strongest version of yourself when this person calls, you belligerent with rage for no apparent reason, can just think Let me think why this person might be angry, right?
5:40
And let me put myself in their shoes with their experiences, their background, the things that they're projecting onto the situation.
And let me put those glasses on so that I can approach this.
Because the thing is, you can't use your own level of Reason, especially when someone's being unreasonable, you can't use your reason.
5:58
It's just going to escalate the situation, so it's like you kind of have to step into their shoes and look through their distorted lens of the world to try and understand their reasoning, and then kind of step-by-step remove layers of filters to that lens to hopefully bring them back to reality.
6:14
And this is just kind of like the summarized short version of the conversation that I had with play with my friend and the the PHD, the doctor, doctor, doctor doctor tea.
West, if you're listening, I know you sometimes do so that's my shot out and this guy's G and so anyways listening to how he resolves conflict people who are suicidal, people who want to jump off Bridges.
6:40
Like he did that literally like 40 hours a week for two years.
Like I was just talking people off Bridges talking people who are drunk, who have no, you know, like reasoning power.
And I think if we can, if we can approach prospects like that and not be offended and think no this is like I think at the base level, we get offended because we make it about us.
7:02
I think that's I think that's real.
Like we get offended because we think it's about us, we think what they're saying is a reflection of us, and that's just not reality.
It's about them.
And if we can kind of live in their little world, then we can ultimately win the frame by having the highest amount of care for them and Caribbean more for them than they do.
7:25
And so I think that that whole concept of caring more about the buyer really applies to everything, not just Sales.
But when you're talking to a vendor, when you're talking to your spouse, when you're talking to it, like whoever it is, I think, I think I'm taking sales ideology and applying it to the real world and it works.
7:45
But anyways, maybe maybe that was useful for you.
For me, it was incredibly enlightening, just remembering that anger is weakness.
So whenever you express anger, you lose the frame automatically, right?
Unless you have a gun, right?
But you lose the frame.
If you can just be neutral, you are much stronger than 7.
8:01
See who's angry?
And if you can truly empathize with the person, then you always win the conversation.
And so I thought that was really powerful for me.
I thought I would share it with you.
I hope you guys have phenomenal.
Friday, your closing sales and have an amazing day.
I'll catch you guys soon.
Bye.









0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do, that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
But when they let us go back to business and open our doors.
You're going to open your doors and I think a lot a lot fewer people are going to come back and you think welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
0:36
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Good morning everyone and one day I hope you guys are had a good restful weekend or maybe not hope you were not resting it on just selling tons of people in remote Fitness over the weekend and hopefully you were but if you were not, then this message is for you.
1:01
So I'm calling this, the oh shit, moment, I was having a conversation with a friend of mine who's in the same space is us.
And he was talking to me about some of the beliefs that he's getting over the phone with some of the gym owners that he's talking to etcetera and it was kind of interesting.
Because you were saying that, you know, these things change week to week, but he said right now everyone's in denial phase.
1:23
You said right now they're in the phase of.
I'm going to I'm going to hold out.
I think I can wait a couple more weeks for this to be over and I guess I'm here to say that I don't think that's going to work out for you.
And here's here's why I don't think sitting and waiting is going to work out for you.
1:40
And hoping that when you open your gym, it's going to work out.
I'm calling this the Ship moment because right now, I think that there's still a certain sense of hope, right?
I think that when they turn the lights back on when they turn the economy back on, when they let Jim's back, which by the way, will be last.
1:58
But when they let us go back to business and open our doors.
You're going to open your doors and I think a lot a lot fewer.
People are going to come back and you think and I think that what's going to happen is going to be a slower recovery than most people anticipate because people are still weary Etc.
2:15
And I think some people We'll just like, always like, there's a reason.
The on-demand economy is the on-demand economy, right?
Everyone thought that people, I was really so funny.
I had an Internet troll yesterday or two days ago, who commented on Dad and literally just saying stupid things like stupid, like trying to be smart but saying stupid things and he was like as soon as online fitness as soon as the gyms will back up all the song like this stuff is going to go away and I was like really you think that people are just going to choose a less convenient option after they come back here?
2:46
Like well people really value the in person, you know, blah blah blah right.
People said the exact same thing about Blockbuster against Netflix.
They're like the CEOs of Blockbuster because it's so easy to rationalize our like human beings.
3:04
Don't want to think of Bad Case scenarios.
And so, we rationalize that we don't need to change, right?
And so Blockbuster Executives when they were like, hey are you concerned about this online streaming stuff?
They were like, no people always value.
Making in night, making an evening going and picking up, you know, picking out their movie walking inside and getting their candy, like, it's become an experience.
3:26
And so we think that people will continue to Value this experience, guess what?
They were fucking wrong.
People would rather just click on the couch and do nothing.
Right?
Is the experience of being at your couch better than the experience of shopping at Blockbuster?
I would say no, I really miss Blockbuster, a lot of times, but I didn't miss enough to not use Netflix or use Netflix way more, right?
3:45
And so the reality is that people Will always choose their convenience.
And I think what happened very like recently or currently right now is that a huge piece of the marketplace that never otherwise would have tried online training or maybe would have in the next decade.
It took all of the remote services and drive drag to 10 years into the future in terms of mass adoption, it was forced to adoption.
4:06
All right.
And so I think a large percentage of people are going to say a larger than most homeowners anticipate are going to stay in a remote setting, right?
I think a lot of people are still Their jobs.
Here's the others.
Oh, shit moment.
Is that people's some of the companies that did layoffs, may not rehire, everyone, right?
4:23
Because the demand is not going to be what it was at the single greatest moment in economic history.
You mean like the best economy ever that happened before this?
And so just like the, oh, shit moment is going to be when you turn the lights on and people don't show up right?
4:39
Which transparently will be great for me because I'm just going to Mark the shit out of the gym set.
Want to work with us because like that will be when marketing is more important than ever because your going to have to differentiate and get your name out there more than anyone elses, right?
But let's rewind the clock real quick.
What do you need to do now?
4:55
Right?
What do you do now?
Because the oh shit moment will come.
Now, some people have stronger communities than others, right?
And I always want to put my disclaimer for good operators, right?
If you're an amazing operator, you haven't lost anyone.
Then you'll probably recover better than people who have lost people, right?
Because you have a stronger Community, you have more blood and coaches, you have better culture, etcetera, right.
5:13
But what should you do now?
So it is my belief and Looking at the math.
I'm going to do this big presentation with Jim Lawrence, don't work.
I did a huge statistical model.
Looking at the difference between Roi on remote versus Roi in person and the question is whether or not you want to be a business owner or a gym owner and that's a very real question like super, super real?
5:35
That's a personal question, right?
But if you're in this to maximize making money because I've had tons of Jim's who flew out during our VIP days and said, Alex want to make a million dollars a year and I said it's not going to happen in one Jim right now, Talking Heads of gurus would be like you can totally like, show me the fucking bank statement, all right?
5:52
And then I'll and then I'll believe you, right?
But no I like it's not from one facility.
Unless you have a massive, massive facility and typically Group, Training personal, training, set will be only a piss a part of that, right?
Like, if you have 6,000 members, paying $100 a month lifetime, then sure you can make a million dollars here, right?
6:09
But most people didn't invest five million dollars into their build out, right?
So it's understanding relative scope.
Okay, so in my Leave, there's no way better than right now to for the best operators to be able to build a million-dollar income business, to 34 million dollar top-line business.
6:27
Because one, we're marketing, a 25-mile radius and seeing 0 decrease in sales percentages.
All right.
Summer one number to our remote Jim's right now, or closing a higher percentage of leasing they did.
In person, that's a function of one.
6:42
Major thing is that they're getting 40% of our leads onto it into a sales.
Al's conversation compared to 20% you know whatever they were doing before.
All right, so they have twice as many at-bats and so even if they're not as good on the phone, they're not twice as bad over the phone, right?
6:57
And so they're a little if you look at right now the average closing percent to 29 percent.
So they're closing 29 percent over the phone they were closing 42% in person.
All right, but if you get twice as many at-bats, you actually still net more sales and so number one, you can have a bigger Geographic radius.
7:12
So the many people that I've talked to us is like I want to have a bigger impact.
Here's how.
I have a bigger impact you can go remote and how people are not in your neighborhood.
Number two lead costs are cheaper, not because of the ads, the ad Impressions and stuff, because that's temporary right.
We've already seen it, go back to normal.
7:28
So the at the cost per impression is has gone 100, sent back to more normal since two or three weeks ago.
All right.
People are advertising again.
But it's because when you draw from bigger radius, you get cheaper leads, that's just period.
If you run a an ad nationally, it's this is like challenge or whatever you'll get, you know, 25-cent leads the issue is, how do you create trust?
7:49
How do you create a sale or trustworthy environment for a lead to opt in and then buy something on the first phone call?
Right?
And that's where having I would consider like the semi local appeal automatically gives you gives you one or two trust points in your direction which is allowing us to make sales on these first calls.
8:07
But if we're looking at it purely from a math perspective, which I would urge you to be a business owner, not a gym owner for the moment right now, our guys are essentially breaking even on the first transaction right now.
They're used to making 2 1 3 2 1 4 2 1 etcetera on the first transaction, right.
8:23
But you're limited by your Your Capacity to fulfill in terms of how many people you can have.
It each time you're limited by your lead flow because let's be real like leave flow of a 25-mile radius.
This is always going to be higher in cheaper than in as five-mile radius because it's quadratic, right?
8:40
So if you have a five mile radius and then you go from 5 to 10, you didn't double the amount of people that you saw, you pied it, right?
So 3.14, whatever the math is, but it's basically, like, let me put in layman's terms.
If you have a 12-inch pizza and have a 24 inch pizza, a 24 inch pizza is not twice as big as 12 inch piece.
8:55
You put like four 12 inch pieces inside of a 24 inch piece because that's how circles work with with, with called quadratic expansion.
But anyways, and so when you go to a 25-mile radius, you're talking Ten times, you know?
I mean the amount of people that you would be reaching otherwise or 20 or 50, whatever the math is and so because of that you can have a much bigger, reach, help, more people can like, anybody who's ever served with lead flow that doesn't have to happen anymore.
9:20
Like you don't have to struggle with lethal anymore because it's literally enormous and you pretty much can always get lead flow.
If your target is big enough, Hey guys, real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
9:36
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers, make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
Its fo free in exchange for email so that I can email you when we launched under leads.
9:55
And so that you can not miss out on it.
Because last time I sold out for like, Straight weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
All right, and so putting all these things together.
Cheaper leads bigger, Geographic radius consistently generation a consistent, 11% of leads close which is what we're seeing right now which is higher than most people doing person breaking even on the front end and having 80 percent gross margin on the back end like you're talking about spending you know right now if you spend $1500 will make six thousand dollars in front in Revenue in 30 days.
10:29
That's what the math is, right?
That's the average.
All right, that's the average.
Okay. $1500.
At 6600 is the actual number of upfront cash in the first 30 days for an online business.
You know, me, people have tried to start an online business, do any online business gurus there are and the reason they don't have an agency set up or whatever is because they can't guarantee an outcome, right?
10:50
They only tell the one or two testimonials that they have of the hundreds of students, they have, all right?
I'm giving you the average numbers average average for online.
So if you wanted to make a six figure income, all right.
We take you 30 days to build a recurring Revenue stream.
11:08
If you spent, if you spent fifteen hundred dollars, it would take you spend $1500, you close 30 39 percent.
So let's just bump it to make a conservative.
So you spent twenty two hundred dollars in ad spend over the first 30 days, you'd be able to have 50 people in your online remote business.
11:25
After you lost 44% for not going into continuity.
All right, so I'm accounting for that that you only convert 60% into continuity at 200 bucks a month, right?
Right?
That's a ten thousand dollar a month business remote, you can do it in 30 days.
Like averages, if your average you can do it in 30 days right now.
11:44
And so the big question that you have to ask is one, am I holding out for what's going to happen that I don't know about because you don't know what's going to.
I don't either that's just my guess but like you don't know what's going to happen, but what I can tell you is the opportunity is there.
And so in the next 30 days in the next 60 days, if you wanted to build yourself a six-figure or multi six-figure online income, you could do it.
12:06
I know that a lot of my jewelry won't do that.
They're going to go back to the gym and that's fine.
I'm here to serve I'm here to provide whatever value the community that I have asked for.
But if I were to enterprising motherfucker, which I am, I would be strongly, considering this, it has been very difficult for me to not throw my hat back in the ring and start selling Fitness at large.
12:23
Because when I see those types of numbers in terms of acquisition I was like hmm.
How many sales guys we got?
I was like I wonder if I was like I wonder if there's a bunch of gym owners who went out of business, so I could just hire him sales people because when I see that kind of stuff.
Three, two, one, four, two, one up front, You know what I mean, 10 to 1 at 30 days 10 to 1 at 60 days, 60 days.
12:45
Like in gym launch, I lose money, the first 30 to 60 days, right?
And like I've just, I just know the math game, right?
I just willing to make decisions with math.
If you are able to make decisions with math right now, and not let your emotions and not let your fear and not, let your discomfort around learning a new skill, which is selling over the phone.
13:01
Because the only thing you have to do, that's it.
As long as you acquire that skill set, which by the way, will set you up better for when you get back to the gym.
Because if you can, sell over the phone, you convert a high percentage of lead.
It's always right.
If you can just learn that skill, you can have an online business.
Suppose that right now and I hope and I think my hunch is that that buying Behavior will not change.
13:24
People will be.
Now the mass Market has been introduced to what online training is like, most people even know what it was.
Now they know what it is.
All right?
And so that that like your underestimate, how big of a deal it is for them to even recognize that industry, all right?
And so one people will now know what online training is number two, they will be comfortable, more comfortable, buying a remote setting here State over the phone, Yeah, this is after the lights, get turned back on because you're like, well, I don't want to change things, you know, temporarily.
13:50
Because something, you know, when what happens we go later.
What if you have a business that just cash flows later and then you have your gym because many people like I won't even get into it, but over the phone you just say yeah you know when covid happened we started doing our first consult over the phone and it ended up just be more convenient for people so we just stuck with it.
14:05
Anyways, so what's your name?
Why'd you click on the ad, right?
Like you can just preface the sale and that everything else flows like normal, right?
Because this has given us, the biggest reason of all time.
The biggest, why am I remote?
Why are you doing this over the phone?
Why are we doing this online?
It has.
Now given everyone permission to have that reason that we never had before, right?
14:25
And educated, like thank you to the government.
For educating all consumers on online and remote setting Fitness, right?
Thank you to the news, thank you to everybody for helping us out.
Alright?
So I say all this to say, I think that for everyone who's holding out and waiting, I don't think that's a smart decision.
14:44
I don't want to be right.
I think I probably Will be, I think a lot of people in turn the lights back on and a lot of people are coming back, right?
Think of this like a vacation.
It's like all these people are like you know what actually I'm going to keep doing things at home or, you know, it's actually kind of more convenient for me to just kind of do it on my own schedule as if having to go there, come back shower, all that stuff, there's just kind of easier for me because convenience and speed always win with humans, always, you have to always bet on convenience because we are lazy, right?
15:11
And especially when it comes to Fitness, all right?
And so it's like well that's why That's why many people can mark it outside of five mile radius.
Good people are too lazy to drive further right there.
Too lazy.
You're like but our gym, so great.
It's like yeah, but they're going to choose a shittier Jim that's closer to them just being real, right?
15:28
And so if you can take the service to them which we now have the opportunity to learn the skill set to do that, you can by the time, this thing turns back on probably have more recurring profit profit income than you did before this.
But it's for the people who want to win and who want to take action.
Otherwise if you're just going to wait, totally cool will help you when you want to come.
15:46
Back because we do that too.
But that's just my that's my two cents right now and I know that whenever I talk about online, it's always polarizing.
But I have a really hard time.
Not speaking my mind about something that I think is more profitable, and I think it's lower risk.
And I think in the post Corona economy, the businesses that will win or the ones that have lower overhead and have higher margins and have a higher ability to reach customers where they're at and all of those boxes get checked.
16:10
And then you get all the added bonus that its benefits.
That I said earlier virtually unlimited lead flow cheaper, Leads bigger, radius, higher profit margin.
You get all of those things on top of everything.
I said.
So anyways, don't let the oh shit moment have to do you take action now, start selling remote.
16:28
I think it is, it is incredibly incredibly incredibly awesome right now and you can get it.

Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out, if that's what you are into.
0:16
And if not keep enjoying the show, what is up everyone and welcome to the gym.
Seekers podcast, my name is Alex and I will be your host if you are a gym owner and you are looking to fill your gym and see how we keep getting all these gym owners.
All these dollars.
All these clients you can go to, I don't hate money.com and that is only if you do not hate money, if you do anyone, even please over there.
0:36
Anyways, I love that URL.
And it was so I wanted to continue the discussion, we're talking about yesterday, how to spell expensive stuff and really the sales process in general.
And one of the things that that they kind of came up with the very end was the two main questions about sales and I want to dig into that because like if you understand this then you can basically sell anything.
0:55
Okay and as someone who has like here we go I'm going to go to my own horn.
I've been flown out for 25,000 a day to go help mortgage team.
Some more leads.
I've helped info product Guys, Somewhere more phone sales.
We've done high-tech, we've downloaded, we don't high volume but we lost.
We've done a lot of different stuff and Understanding the nature of this.
1:15
These two questions is the basis of all persuasion from a sales standpoint, so I'll dig into them.
So the first question is If I am telling the truth and this program product service Etc, does what I say it does, is it worth it to you for this price or does this price mix?
1:37
You know, like is this is that, is that valuable enough?
We can get you to do.
Get you this Promised Land right now.
In the first podcast or Pockets were before this.
I kind of said, well most times they're going to say yes and I thought more about it and that's that's not entirely true because sometimes we were selling let's say if you're selling a I got a friend Darren Casey, who he sells like ten to fifteen thousand dollar, 12-week packages, as online personal training, okay, super high ticket.
2:05
Now in his case.
Now, what if you're doing any kind of like monetization money, you know, any like, you know, if you're be to be a lot of times, it's gonna be related to bottom line, right?
So if you're doing business to business sales, bottom lines can be really important going to want to know their Roi is on buying your product or service, right?
And so, it's really quick, because then it's like, hey, if this makes you more than you're paying, is that worth it?
2:22
They're going to say, yes, And that it's completely clear cut, but the conviction becomes harder right now in the other way and in an emotional selling scripts, do something where you're selling a service, that's really just a benefit to someone, okay?
One of the things that I found value in, since we, most of our people are gym owners in this is called the Gypsy curse podcast, the Here are some ways that you can build value for someone who you don't think they are, valuing what you were selling as much as they should.
2:53
Okay?
So one pinning, the ideal picture first.
You ask them what they want, OK.
And once they tell you what they want, then really what you're going to do is just enhance that picture and you're going to really try and paint it as a picture, an emotional experience.
Like what would it look like so so Darcy right like what like what do you want to have happen?
3:12
Like well you know and this is a famous Ask questions, like if we were, if we were talking six months from now and you're looking back on this, conversation would have had to have happened for you to be really happy.
Okay.
Which is really just about, like, describing values.
Is that first question?
Is this like, what do you need to think that?
This is valuable, okay?
3:28
And then we'll tell you and in this case the, you know, she might say I just really want to lose 30 pounds and this is where you have like the whole seven layers of why thing, which is, you know, one way of doing it which is just basically asking why over and over again such as I like, okay, why do you lose 30 pounds?
Well because I Okay.
3:45
Well what would so is it just losing 30 pounds or like now when you feel fat is that influencing other things you feel like you're not good like a good mother you feel like like you're not being a good wife like you know is it influencing your work?
Like tell me more about that, right?
I don't like saying why every time that I think people just get really annoyed fast but like tell me more about that looks like dig a little bit deeper here right?
4:07
And eventually you can kind of find the main nuggets, right?
But with this whole value question, In the context of weight loss.
I like to paint the picture more or less.
If you were 80 years old, there's two main huge Priceless, things that I like to sell a most Asian quick break just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
4:33
Alright.
So send me a connection request.
A note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or Layla's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
One permanent weight loss is the is like, the is the Holy Grail.
4:53
Okay, so if you can sell pretty way less, don't mind you.
This is a huge caveat.
You have to know how to deliver.
Okay.
But if you can deliver right then like if you lost 25 pounds and you never gained it back.
So you're 80 years old and you, you feel great, it's still awesome, like Mobility, you're walking around.
5:13
If you do all these things and you've kept that weed off your whole life.
You're 30.
Your 40s or 50s or 60s and you and you continue that habit of this healthy lifestyle, you sleep better, you're nicer to your spouse.
You work harder?
Because you have more energy, all these things.
I'm like, what is that worth you?
5:30
Right?
See how much more valuable that is than hey, like, what if we helped you lose ten pounds like, well, you can just shed water weight and gain it back if you really want to.
But that's not the point, right?
That's not what they want.
So what is that value to you?
Right, here's another one.
If every time you Walked into the room.
5:48
You felt like you were like in just unbelievable shape.
Like you're incredibly toned.
Like and like a good one.
I like to ask is like in high school, right?
Yeah.
What was your weight in high school?
Now, some people are overweight in high school, but a lot of people weren't like mad.
If I get back to my high school and subliminal speed, they won't even believe it rather.
6:05
Be like, I'm never gonna get back to that.
But I'd be happy at 150 that like, but I like taking one, like, but what if we could get you to 130, right?
And have you toned and and like when you walk into a room you get It takes because people are like, dang, and depending on where their ages be like, you know.
6:23
Okay, I want, I will go in that age is tricky, but, you know, if you can hit someone be like, hey, she looks great for any age.
That's a terrible caveat anyways.
But like, if you could get back to that because I'm, I'm bringing this up because I know we can because we've done it so many times.
6:41
But like, is that something in like, you got to stay there and not only did you stay there?
Because people always talk about maintenance.
What about we get you to lose 20 pounds and then you continue to improve, okay?
Not maintained but improve you grow, you get better, you get stronger, you get leaner, get more told you have more energy, you continually do this, right?
6:58
What if this habit start trickling over in other parts of your life?
Because then you start to know that you have this discipline and believe it or not discipline in this area of your life will carry over all the other areas of your life, okay?
How you do one thing to say you everything?
All right, right now, you're doing this pretty poorly.
I didn't probably feel guilty about it.
I'm like, yeah, I'm like what if we could give you the habits, I could fix that.
7:17
Right?
What if like you lose those 20 pounds of not only losing but you continue to improve.
Like what is that worth to you?
Okay.
And then you can throw stones.
Okay.
The first don't process would look like this.
You say like yes I get there's a like you could just starve yourself for you know, three weeks and you can lose the same amount of weight, right?
7:36
But Have you tried a diet before choosing?
So yes, I'm like I'm so you've lost weight before in past.
So you have lost me were like, okay but why are you here?
Because you gain it back, right?
So like when you're 80 and you look back on your life, like do you want to just say that you are in shape for your four times in your life, for a couple months, maybe a year?
7:58
Do you want to say that?
No.
Well, if you'd like, if you keep continuing down the path that you're at, you keep doing these one-off things, then like, that's what it's going to be your story.
So like, do you want to change that story and be like?
Yeah.
Awesome.
Because we can do that.
8:15
Now, if we can help you change the story, imagine this is your story.
Today, you look back and you're like, I can't believe I sat down with this guy and I paid all this money to do this thing.
But boy, am I glad I did?
Because that was the day that everything changed for me.
My life improved, my my marriage.
8:34
My work, my mother had all of those things improved because I got this one area, my life under control.
Like if you took, if you could tell that story how much is that worth to you?
And I like to care like you like I'm just being real with you.
It's like, is that worth it to you and then the bit like well yeah, I mean if that if we could do that, it's worth it to be like, boom.
8:55
Okay, so we figured out the first question, great.
So now they've described the value.
So, if I need to build the value up so that I can then get the The agreement then that's those are the questions that were asking in order to do it.
Okay.
And then we would transition to the second question about believability and conviction that you can deliver on that promise.
9:12
Okay.
Since this test actually took a little bit longer than I thought but I'm really glad I got to dig into that question a little bit more.
I'm going to make another podcast right now, right?
After this, talking about the second question regarding conviction.
So the two main questions, one If this does, what we say it does, is it worth this price.
9:30
If you're in the B2B space, it's much easier to do.
If you're in the emotional selling space, it's harder to do okay?
And within weight loss, that's an emotional sale.
So you say like, this is how I would stack, the value talk long-term, you talk permanent, you talk about habits, you talk about all the other areas of life that it trickles.
You talk about building someone's story because what you're really selling is a new identity.
9:48
Okay, you're selling a new identity.
Okay, cool.
So if you're a gym owner and you like what you hear, and you think that we know a thing or two, which we super appreciate and you don't hate money.
Go to, I don't hate any.com and we'll show you how we get Jim's from zero to full capacity in 30 days.
10:04
And we are excited to potentially have on the phone with you and not tell you anything, okay?
So have a good day and I'll see you on the flip side.

You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show 99% of the time most tactics work.
0:22
It's just that the execution is where it gets lost.
Welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
We talk about how to get more customers.
MERS how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
0:39
What's going on, everyone?
Happy Thursday.
I actually had this on my mind last night to talk to you about, which is the easiest mistake in business and one of the hardest decisions that you have to encounter in entrepreneurship and it's the juxtaposition between In strategy and tactics or said differently between tactics and execution, all right?
1:08
And so just for sake of clarity, when I'm saying tactics, I'm talking about what you're trying to do to accomplish something, right?
And then the execution is whether or not it's being done the weight as intended, right?
1:24
And so, one of the hardest parts of Entrepreneurship, and I think one of the reasons that Actually earlier on in my, you know, entrepreneurial career and I still and I still do it constantly.
All right, is is looking at a situation and then not getting the result that you were hoping for and then changing the tactics, right?
1:44
Because like, let's say, let's say you're trying to retain people, write, like or or you're trying to sell people, whatever it is, right?
And so that's that's, that's the goal.
All right?
You say, hey, we're going to do phone sales, right?
And so, you know, you write a script and then you, you know, give it to your team and you're like, all right, we're gonna do phone sales.
2:00
And then a week later phone sales aren't happening and then you assume as the entrepreneur, oh I must have provided the wrong strategy, the wrong tactics to my people, right?
And so then what do you do?
You change it right?
2:16
And the thing is and this is the hardest part.
Like this is so hard.
I struggle with this all the time.
That's why I wanted to make this video is really pumped about it.
The hardest part is that 99% of the time most tactics work.
It's Just that the execution is where it gets lost.
2:33
All right, so I'm going to say this again.
All right?
The reason that you're not getting the outcome from the tactics that you employed for whatever, the goal was whether it's retaining customers, whether it's selling, whether it's getting more reviews, whether it's getting more leads, right?
The strategy is usually not wrong, right?
2:49
What you're going about your idea, most of the time is pretty sound because most of us, make pretty common-sense decisions.
I think a lot of the time and we think it's because we're doing it that we made.
The wrong call that it's not working.
When really it's not being executed, the way it was supposed to be executed.
3:07
And so that's where 90% 95% 99% of the errors.
That happened in my business are things that are not executed properly.
Write a sales script that's not done, right?
It's not done with the correct tonality.
It's not done is not executed in a timely manner, right?
3:24
The right questions are not being asked to the same degree if you're retaining people.
When When you were, you know, when your coaches are reaching out to them, are they doing it on a regular Cadence?
So they doing it with the, the tonality and intention that, you know, they should be having now when you initially.
And that's why, that's why the hardest part of business stuff, especially as you scale.
3:42
Its people write its operations, the skill set of learning how to Market and sell typically is one of the first ones you acquires an entrepreneur.
But after that being able to scale, the business comes down to your ability to repeat that result in other people.
And so then what happens is you start?
4:00
Taking whatever data they give you and taking it as truth, but most of the time, I'm not saying they're lying.
I'm saying they just don't know any better, which is why it's so essential for most entrepreneurs to acquire so many skills.
So that we know how to operate it correctly, right?
4:15
How we know how to do the thing?
We're trying to teach correctly because then you can spot when someone's doing incorrectly.
Now, the hard part is time, right?
How do I Q&A, right?
How do I know quality assurance?
How I double check that each of of these aspects of my business are being executed properly, right?
4:34
And that's where having consistent.
Like, that's why the communication Cadence of when you're talking to your direct reports, when you're talking to your company and then the drills that you have them do.
Like, if you're not drilling your team on the things that they need to be learning and repeating on a consistent basis.
4:49
They will forget, they will stop thinking about it, right?
They will start prioritizing because they perceive that you're in a longer prioritizing.
If you don't talk about it, they think it's no longer a thing, right?
When you are.
Assuming it's being done, right?
And they're assuming it's no longer important which is why you're not talking about it which is why it gets so boring as October because you feel like you're repeating yourself all the time and it drives you nuts because you don't like doing the same thing over and over again.
5:15
You like doing new things because that's what made you an entrepreneur right.
But the thing that gets you from 0 to 1 is not the thing gets from one to ten right and doing the getting from one to ten is getting 10 people to do the same thing consistently over and over again and that is hard.
Hey Mose.
5:32
An Asian quick break, just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright.
So send me a connection request a note.
Let me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
5:47
All right, so let's get back to the show.
Right.
And so what happens is, you hire one or two people?
It works.
Okay.
You've been repeating yourself.
You're like, great.
I cracked the code.
Then you hire more people.
And all of a sudden, something starts happening.
You like what's going on?
And they're like, well the marketplace is different now.
6:02
Well, the Baba's different and so then you assume that you have to change your strategy, you have to change how you're doing things right?
When in fact, you just have to get back in roll-up-your-sleeves, do the boring work?
Repeat yourself again.
Make sure that the process is being followed as intended as you wanted it to be done.
6:21
And you can create training programs for people just like you do for fitness, right?
Like you can create training programs for sales like this is what you're going to do for the first 30 minutes a day.
This would be the second 30 minutes.
What I want you to do is let me know when you're done this and this every day, that's what you need to tell me, right?
And what happens is, then they create this consistent case and they know that you're paying attention, right?
6:40
And these are the little systems that have to happen in order to maintain Excellence on a consistent basis.
And I am by no means saying that we are perfect or anywhere close to it, right?
But I'm saying these are some of the things that I found have have Cause so much mental duress for me and for my employees because I change things too frequently because I assumed the information I was being given was based on perfect execution, when in fact it was just not being executed.
7:06
Well, and most times you don't need to change anything at all.
You just need to go in and put attention on the process.
Make sure it's being adhered to re-drill retrain, the team re motivate them on, why it's important and then typically, you'll get the outcomes.
7:21
Like, I can't tell you the amount of times we've made no changes to sales scripts.
And we just like, make sure it's being followed or or really just read through testimonials again, reconvicted team and then sales picks up overnight right overnight.
Like so wasn't a lack of skill set.
It was just lack of adhering to the process, whose lack of execution, right?
7:40
And so, Andy Grover, I don't have his book around me but high output management.
He says the to the the job of the boss is motivation and training.
That's it.
That's how that's how he defined it.
The only thing I added was communication because they need to know what, you know, want them to do and sometimes they don't know, or they think they, they you think that they know you both are working on different game, Plants, right.
8:04
I had that in because I think it's a precursor to those two things but assuming they know what you want them to do either they don't know how to do it.
They're not motivated to do it and so that is 99% of time.
What you have to do and it's not fun, it's not exciting, it's not new, it's not different.
But I can tell you every time you get in the Spot.
8:22
Right?
And I this is what 90% of the stuff that I get on, on our questions, on our daily call when I have with our with our clients is questions about like well this was the intended outcome and it's not happening.
So what should I change and typically, you don't need to change anything using to make sure that they're doing what they're supposed to be doing and that just takes the boring work of looking and examining and listening to call recordings and listening to, to on boardings and watching the footage that you have from your You're you know cameras for the workouts inside of your facility to see if the energy of the workouts is there the see if they're making sure they're doing the announcements every day to make sure they're doing all the stuff you need them to do following the checklist, right?
9:02
And I just I just want to own a save you so much pain and suffering for you and for your team from you, having the Whiplash or them having Whiplash from you constantly changing to sleep, man.
He's always trying to change stuff and it's usually just because it's not being executed, right?
9:17
And so if I can, if I can give you just one, stop gap or just get you to take.
Breath before making a huge change in your business and just step back and say, like water.
And I examine first to make sure that this is being executed.
The way, I intended it, before making a change and I can, I can virtually guarantee you that you will save so much time and effort, your team will pick up its Effectiveness way faster.
9:43
Most times and then you really begin to like truly internalize how important execution and operations is to scale the company.
So anyways, I know that's not the sexy stuff but that's the real stuff of how businesses scale and I hope you find Value in that and if you did drop a like or a comment and if you did not then sorry otherwise have an amazing Thursday.
10:05
And I'll catch you guys on the flip side.
Keep executing, and I'll catch you guys soon.
Bye.

Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
Your ability to maintain neutrality is based on your ability to be optimistic.
Welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer.
And the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
0:33
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
I already happy Wednesday.
And I want to make a quick little video for you or podcast about emotional work.
It sounds like it's their therapy thing, but it's not at all.
One of the things that came up for my sales.
0:49
Guys on our side, for Jim launch was that at this current period of time, there are there more gems that are getting on the phone and he's they describe it as being reluctant to confront reality.
And so I kind of wanted to make something about that which is in the, in the book.
1:06
Good to great or great leadership.
I think is one of those books.
The author talks about Jim Collins talks about some of the character traits of good leaders and he talks about one dichotomy which are too, you know, it's too kind of things that you have to balance back and forth which is maintaining almost unreasonable optimism for the future while also confronting the brutal facts of reality.
1:30
And I think that as we develop as entrepreneurs, there's just fewer and fewer things that affect us Us because like I'm sure right now.
So just to give you some some hope and positive feelings about yourself right now.
Can you remember what your business was like, maybe five years ago and the things that you used to stress about and the things that used to, you know, bother you keep you up at night, it might have been a one star review on Yelp or or a client talking shit or a trainer, you know, leaving and stealing clients or things like that, right?
2:04
And now five years later, you've just kind of you've weathered a little bit, right?
You just you're like, you're your Skin's a little thicker and so not to go back to the talent talent, stacking kind of module of progression for entrepreneurs.
But first, you acquire skills, then you are a character traits and then you break beliefs, right?
2:23
And that's kind of a cycle that continues to happen at each level.
And I think this one definitely falls under kind of a combination of beliefs and character traits, but I think your ability to maintain neutrality He is based on your ability to be optimistic and think about the things that are going to happen or things that you're currently working on things, you're experimenting on things that you're hopeful for and holding on to that optimism, is what allows us to then get into the mud.
2:50
And confront the brutal reality of a situation because I think the easiest example that I hear of with especially small business owners is just like not knowing how much money you have in the bank account, not wanting to look at European L not wanting to Look at your profit.
Not wanting to look at your expenses and that's the dirty work, right?
3:08
And that's not look not wanting to look at what your sales conversion numbers are not wanting to listen to sales recording.
Sees, you're afraid of how bad your sales team, might be just all the things like that, where it's turning over the rocks and looking at the little wormy things that are Ethan being like, all right?
3:23
I'm going to confront this and I think that I don't know if you've heard the saying with like doctors is like, there's no bad diagnosis and I think that the moral of the saying is that knowing that you I have cancer, for example, it doesn't ever not really benefit you, it just hurts emotionally but the sooner you find out your bad news, the better it is.
3:43
And so we have to rewire our brains to start loving bad news and trying to frame them as instead of problems as really opportunities to come up with Solutions.
And I think the best entrepreneurs, at least the ones that I aspire to be like, Thrive, under pressure, and thrive in new and unfamiliar environments.
4:03
And to be really Honest with you.
I think part of the reason that Layla asked me to make this, as I like, I've actually never been more calm and I've never been happier in my earth.
I can't remember a time more recently that I've been happier than I am right now than during this whole covid mess.
And I think it kind of it's beautiful because it forces you to just focus on the only things that matter and everything else, just because some extraneous and you get to have big new challenging problems that come up and so you get to like really flex your entrepreneurial muscles, which is like fun and exciting for entrepreneurs.
4:34
If you have employees, then you should understand that they definitely aren't comfortable.
Like you are in change, but we are though, because we're made from this cloth and that's what got us into this business to begin with is because we love the risk, we love the change, we love to be a certain, you know, to a certain extent, we love the Gamble and I think that's ultimately what businesses and, you know, large thing is just kind of betting on you and betting on your skill set and it's like a poker game with an infinite board.
4:57
Anyways, I won't get into it, I love it.
And so all that to say it's maintaining the dichotomy of being persistently And almost unreasonably optimistic with the ability to confront, the brutal facts and they go hand-in-hand.
And so if you have somebody on your team who is constantly talking - it's difficult for them to even see anything positive in the end up sabotaging themselves but you yourself have to think or at least for me you know you have to catch your own thoughts around that stuff.
5:24
I don't really feel like I have them that much anymore to be if I'm being really truthful with you like the negative thoughts around that stuff because I just I love the stuff that we have going on and I don't So if you have this, but this has been something that's been really valuable for me, is a board of all, of kind of like the big idea is like, the big, big, Alex ideas of things that could just drive massive opportunity, for the gyms could drive opportunity for our business.
5:47
And so I always have these things which are new and fun and exciting for me.
And I balance those that work that I have to do with like the meetings and the 10 ones and the and the, you know, the doing reps and it just the the step, the boring work, right?
Most Nation real quick.
6:06
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to fifteen hundred dollars.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
6:25
And I think you have to have both because doing the boring work like for example and I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to participate on this real quick.
I started taking over the daily call again within Jim watch.
So that pretty much for all of our customers they can hop on a daily call with me every single day and it was something that we started four years ago and it has a lot of benefits because I have to it forces me to confront reality.
6:50
All right, I have my Frontline customers on the call and if they want to unmute themselves and tell me, To go fuck myself.
They can do that right in front of everyone and so, it forces me to solve problems in real time and it forces me to constantly confront reality, right?
7:07
I think a lot of people, a lot of businesses would be would dread talking to their customers everyday in a large wide format, but I will tell you that it has it in.
No uncertain.
Terms has been one of the single Cornerstone activities that I practiced over the last four years that has been, I think I think one of the secrets to Our Success because in taking those calls I one know exactly what the needs of a gym owner are today right now not last week not an hour ago right now to I know that intimate pains that they are struggling right now which allows me to improve my product at such a faster rate than anyone else does because I can also test things on a daily basis have five guys, try one thing Five Guys, tried other report back tomorrow rather than having to go all the way down through the chain of command.
7:55
And communicated them all the way back up and have that whole process take a month or six weeks.
And so, the reason I think that Jim watch has been able to consistently stay on top of an industry that typically very much Cycles through quote gurus.
Right?
And it's been because we've been able to innovate Solutions at a faster rate, and we've been able to distribute those Innovations across our community to faster and more effective rate.
8:17
Number 1 and 2, we are better able to communicate with our customers, right?
And prospective customers because we understand their pains, Now, why?
Because we talk to them every single day, and if our product doesn't work, we know if there's a process that the process that needs to change, like it used to be like this.
8:36
And now it has to be like this, we know, and we find out before the six month lag time, that it would take most entrepreneurs to see a huge spike in churn that then gets them wondering.
I wonder what this is right.
And so, from a tactical standpoint, how do you use those two things together?
8:54
The unreasonable optimism with the Confrontation of brutal facts is one of the unreasonable optimism.
Have your list of, at least for me, that works is having the list of Big Ideas that I'm working on and pushing forward.
And then on the flip side, being able to confront, the brutal facts of reality, which in one term can be knowing the numbers of your business.
9:14
Which if you don't, obviously, you should do that.
But then also understanding that you need to hop on, you need to be with the front lines and rub that, like Kiss, You know, as it shake hands and kiss babies.
Not because you need Like value type will my time's worth more than that.
It's not because you the value of the Intel of what is going to come to you in terms of the needs of the customer and how much your product can improve and where are the opportunities exist will far outweigh the cost of time that it takes?
9:42
And it also keeps your teeth sharp so that no one can sneak up from behind you and take you without surprise, you know, under surprise.
So, anyways, that was kind of the juxtaposition that I wanted to break down for you today.
I hope you guys are excited about covid as Excited as I am.
I'm loving this, I'm loving the fast-paced environment.
10:00
I loving the change.
I'm loving the improvements that we've already been able to net out for our business.
That even when Jim's come back are going to create huge Downstream impact for how much money they're gonna be able to make.
And so I'm just very, very hopeful for what is to come.
Even though, I think that many, many, many people will go out of business, and I think many gyms will open back up and then only to reclose 90 days later because they go out of business.
10:25
I That's very real.
But anyways, I hope you have an amazing day.
I hope you crush your goals and I hope this was of something valuable to you, hopefully and otherwise lots of love and I'll catch you guys on the flip side.
But









0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
I think the easiest way to structure operations is first list out the things, the desired outcomes that need to happen.
Welcome to the gym Secrets podcast, we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
0:45
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Happy Thursday, hope things are going well for you wherever you are at.
Or whenever you're listening to this, I don't get a lot of questions about operations.
They just become obvious that they are a problem within a lot of the people that that we help serve.
1:03
And so, it's interesting because now that we work on the Alan side with resellers, it's very clear who is good at operations and who is not.
And that is typically based on the size of the business, the people who are better at operating or the ones who make more money, and this is kind of one of the The unspoken secrets of the entrepreneurial World, especially with in the Internet space that we live in.
1:23
Now, it appears to be all about marketing and sales and Legion and acquisition.
And although those are very important things and you have to start there, it becomes very clear that typically, the entrepreneur has that promotion type of character traits and doesn't dedicate the time to study the operational components of the business which typically are the reasons that someone Is or is not successful.
1:50
And so I wanted to give you at least my simple mental framework for how I think about operations in general and in scaling operations.
And so, for the vast majority of people listening here, you're probably under eight figures.
2:05
Some are under seven, but most people listening to, so probably business owners in the multiple 100,000 a year to, you know, several several million a year and so for that.
So this is who I'm talking to within that context.
I think the easiest way to structure operations is first list out the things, the desired outcomes that need to happen, all right?
2:29
And I think of business very much as a pipeline, which is from click to close to resell, right, and resell within different.
Businesses can be retaining them, so that they pay again or could be a variation of a sense in bone.
I say click.
It means how do I get someone to click in this just within the internet environment, click to opt-in to schedule to show to buy.
2:48
By 2, then ultimately want to buy it again.
And so if you have like with our gyms a four-step sales process or three steps sales process, that's happening.
There are clear activities that need to happen, right?
3:04
And so in the beginning you will have your front end sales and so you need to list that as one of the activities, right?
Because the objective would be to sell them.
The activity is to take the call.
Next, you'd have the nutrition orientation should be the next We'd meet with them.
3:20
So then you need to allocate.
How many of those you're going to need based on your current inflow?
It's the nice thing is that there's a ratio of for every 10 customers we need to do four of these, two of these, two of these.
And one of these, right?
And so, what you can do is once you realize what the outcomes are, you can list out all of the activities that are required.
3:40
So for a typical client, we might know that it takes about two minutes per client per day, and if we know that a coach has three hours, Like we want to see what our Kappa coach at 100.
Then we know that that coach is going to be able to do that within x amount of time, right?
3:56
And so then we book that time on that person's day.
And so what happens is what you should do when you're creating your company is when you're creating each of the roles that are going to support you, you need to look at a calendar and look at what the times of day that this person is going to be working and what they're going to be doing with each hour of their day.
4:14
And so you simply take the activities in the allocated time.
That they need to work and place those on their calendar and that's honestly all there is to it.
All right, so I'm going to give you an example that hopefully flesh this out a little bit, but within within an online Fitness business, which many of you guys are operating right now, there's really four, if demand gen is being taken care of, right?
4:41
So if lead generating, take care of a lead nurtures being taken care of, and I'm saying that because it'll make the example simpler, but also because that's what we do in our company.
For gems is if those two things are taken care of, then there's really not a lot that needs to happen, right?
So first, you need to have first sales calls right to get new customers, talking to prospects, then you need an onboarding.
5:02
All right, that onboarding is be typically nutrition orientation and also walking through the app in the tech in the things that need to happen and that's it, right?
The third thing that will need to occur will be some sort of Ascension conversation which is going to sell them into continuity.
5:18
All right so that's number Three.
Now every customer is going to have one of these things, right?
And so if you're selling here, it is, you're selling 10 people a week, then you need If you're going to, if you're going to maintain that flow, then if you know that your friend sales, 30 minutes, your nutrition appointment is 30 minutes and then your Ascension is 30 minutes then for every client that you're bringing in, you have an hour and a half per week.
5:40
That's going to be allocated right now.
You can divide that up between different people, but the keys to scaling is that eventually it becomes too much for one person to do all of those activities and then you start blocking entire pieces of that type of activity to the next person, right?
And so I'm going to continue with the example.
5:57
After that, the only other activity that's going to be, there would be either recruiting coaches, right?
And obviously the Fulfillment.
And so let's say that the average customer is going to take 5 minutes a day.
I said to you earlier, but let's just say it's five minutes ago, right?
And somebody has, whatever it is, five minutes is a lot.
6:17
Let's say, say 24 math, sake.
So 200 minutes if you had 100 clients per day is what's going to be allocated.
So, that's what are those three?
Three hours.
And You know, 20 minutes.
So you look at someone's schedule.
Now, that's obviously in a perfect scenario, but I'd look at one of my coaches schedules and say, okay, we're going to do 90 minutes in the morning, and we're to do 90 minutes in the afternoon, and we're going to block those times out.
6:40
So, just like that, we have eight hours a day.
Now, I have five hours left.
What else do I want this person to do?
Well, I probably want them to take the onboarding conversations with the new customers were coming in, right?
This is a coach.
And I know that if we generate 10 new customers a week on average, then that's going to take five hours per week, which means I can block one to two hours a day for that and be totally fine, right?
7:05
So I might block, now this is where availability becomes interesting because if you just do it at noon every day, the new customers might not be able to make that time, right?
And so I might have, you know, slots on Monday.
Wednesdays and Fridays at one time and then Tuesdays and Thursdays at another time and that way, it gives them some different time.
7:22
Is to select from, right.
But again, we have our daily activities now.
That nino for that coach is going to be the Fulfillment that's ongoing.
We might also have them, do the nutrition orientation, which would be an hour or two hours per day, right?
So if we have an hour will say an hour per day.
7:38
So now, we've got four of their eight hours that have been taken.
Now, we've got four more hours that can be used by this person.
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
7:55
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over 1,000 hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I push the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
8:17
So now we have options.
Do we want this person to create content?
Do we want this person to do, Outreach?
Do we want this person to gosh?
I mean, whatever.
I mean do we want to expand this person's capacity, right?
So there's or we would know that this person is currently at 50% utilization.
8:37
Now, if you flip that and then think well maybe this person to take some of the exit meetings, right?
So this is maybe this person could take some of the continent.
Now.
This is strategic questions, not operational questions.
But I'm saying this is how you It operationally, it's like okay if we're selling 10 people a week, then we're going to have 10 halfway conversations, we're going to send them into continuity and then we'll also maybe have transformation meeting which is the end where we take the pictures, all that kind of stuff.
9:01
So if you know each of those meetings takes another 30 minutes each per customer.
If we know that we get to new customers per week, then we know that's going to be another hour, so 10 hours per week total.
So it's another two hours per day, assuming that they're working 50 hours a week.
And so now we're at six hours per day Day of work, all right.
9:18
Now, that's if someone's being perfectly efficient, I would still expect people to be perfectly efficient because I think you don't, you get what you tolerate and so that would be six hours a day for a coach.
Now at that point this coach is handling basically, everything.
Post, the initial sale, right?
9:35
They're managing the ongoing fulfillment.
They're managing the onboarding activities for these new customers and they're managing the backend meetings with them to convert them into continuity, right?
And so all of these things, Together would create a role within the business.
9:51
And so, my ask, or my recommendation for you is, if you haven't done this activity, it provides, you immense Clarity and understanding what are the different activities that need to occur in the business to make more money and then once you have the list of the activities, then you know how long each of the activities could shake.
10:08
And then the only variable that will dictate, how many of them you have is what your inflow is, right?
And so, if you know what your inflow is, and you know what your base, S of customers is, and the number and your attrition, you can very accurately back into what a, an ideal day.
10:24
Looks like for each of the roles within your business.
Also, the bigger you get, the more you will find in efficiencies where you're starting these partial roles, they're getting full-time, pay for halftime work, right?
And so, this allows you to be more efficient.
Because you can say, hey, I know you're only at forty percent utilization.
10:39
Why are you telling me that you're too busy right now?
Why are you telling me that I need to hire another coach?
What else are you doing?
That is not Within These parameters.
Now, if someone then says, well, I'm doing this, this and this, then it's like, oh, now either, they'll be founded at things like things that are useful and you know, value producing, or they won't be many times, they're not but that's not because the person who's who your employee is doing this out of, you know, nefarious, intentions.
11:03
They're not trying to be malicious.
They're not trying to hurt your business isn't because a lot of people just don't even know it's valuable, right?
And so they're trying to work the try to provide value.
But a lot of times, they just don't get how like they just a lot of times to join into the bigger picture or ey, you're not having someone do something, right?
11:20
But if the thing that they're doing is is a core activity, like, I got to check in on these people, I got to add them to this.
It takes this long to get the documents back or, you know, sometimes you these past password issues, then you can see, is this something that we can fix operational within an additional process or is it something that we can, you know, exist, either throw out and then get this person to refocus and then increase how much work they're doing by by adding more clients.
11:43
Their roster etcetera.
And so, all this to say, This is how I thought about operations is just in terms of activities and units of time and then expected inflow.
And So, based on those three variables of, this is how many people were coming in?
These are the activities, they need to happen in.
11:59
This is how long they should take, then it allows you to account for all the things that need to happen in the business and will ultimately lead to have a more efficiently run shot.
Now I guarantee you that because of the headline that I had operations redundancy, one of the least listen to podcasts out there but it is the reason that the people who make the most money, make the most money and I just cannot tell you like the amount of people who have access who have tried to copy our stuff at Jim luncheon and and are 1/10.
12:24
One twentieth.
The size of what we are and guys, just like it's it's the boring work.
It's the it's the it's the rolling.
Your sleeves up is the repetitive work.
It's that meetings and training your team on improving how good they are doing the things that is ultimately the thing that's going to propel a company and those things are based on culture and tolerance of the leader.
12:46
And so I just want to leave you with that.
So if you feel like you're constantly overwhelmed and you don't feel like, you have transparency into what your people are doing on, what are they doing all day?
This is the activity that you can do.
That will give you immense Clarity and transparency and what their actions are.
So you can also we structure the business to make the most money and also find in efficiencies or additional tasks that you're not accounting for it that they are doing, which are either revenue-generating or requirements or they're totally worthless activities, that they're simply doing because they just don't know any better.
13:13
And so I highly recommend doing it.
And if you don't know where to start, Art, the easiest thing to do is have your employees.
Take a Time study.
All right?
So time studies very simple.
You have an Excel sheet, you have every 15 minutes of the day and then you just have them write down what they did for each this 15 minutes now, they're going to think that's going to take a lot of time.
13:31
You are never more efficient than when you do a type study.
I probably every time I do want, I tell myself I'm going to do it again like forever and I don't, but but you will literally be more efficient in your work than you ever will.
Because you know, that you're being held accountable to it.
All right?
So it's the like whenever Leyland I need, Go and take a close look at apartment.
13:48
The first thing we do like these numbers aren't adding up.
This feels weird, this feels heavier, this feels like whatever it is.
We go.
We asked them two times a day for a week and then we look at their activities.
You can also very quickly, see where there's bullshit, right?
Where people are like responding to emails.
And like, why do you have three hours of emails?
14:05
Is there something I don't know about how long does it take to reply to any man?
How many emails are you getting every day?
And so that's how you can start peeling the layers back and seeing if someone's being dishonest, which happens right in the dirt and because they want to keep their job and I get that.
But that being said, It's not useful for the business and so that is how if you want to get a baseline of like, okay?
14:22
Well now I know what all the activities are you can deem whether they're valuable or not and you can deem whether you want them to keep doing it or whether they're expanding their time, start expanding their activities to meet the amount of time that they're supposed to be working.
Alright, so that is my my quick that's that's kind of my mental framework for how I look at operations, and how to structure them for different roles within the company is first, look at the the outcomes that you want the activity.
14:45
Need to generate that.
At outcome, how long these activities take per customer per unit and then you can extrapolate out based on the volume based on the inflow.
What each role needs to do.
And then at what points, you will have breaking points where somebody will become overwhelmed and you need to create a new role.
All right?
15:01
So anyways, I hope that was valid before you have the made sense.
Otherwise have a happy Thursday, Happy Corona, happy quarantine.
And I hope you are adapting because you have no choice but to do so otherwise.
All right, lots of kissing butt.

Business is different from baseball in that baseball when you swing for the fences, the most you can ever score is four runs, right?
But in business, every once in a while, when you stepped up to the plate, if you hit the ball hard enough, you can score 1000 runs if you have a chance, Of 100 times payoff and you've got a 1 out of 10 chance of hitting it.
0:34
You should take that bet every time I think that that's not.
It's correct mathematically.
But in practicality, I think there's another sentence that needs to be added to it.
Welcome to the gym Secrets podcast, we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
0:52
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on everyone happy.
Thank today.
Saturday.
Give you nice beautiful Lake View.
Very very pretty out here.
We're in a Bear Lake on the corner of Utah and Idaho but recently I've been spending a lot of time reading it specifically reading from people who make a lot more money than I do.
1:16
And I think that I haven't had a good kind of a little bit more head of a podcast until recently, so I'm going to try and break that streak today.
So one of Hardest, learn lessons that I've ever made, and I'm still actively learning it.
But every time I take a step towards kind of, a better ideal in this direction, I make significantly more money, and so I figured I'd share it with you.
1:37
So, in some of my earlier podcast, I talked a lot about Focus, right?
About learning to say, no.
And I think that over the last year and a half two years, there had been my hardest learned lessons, were where I said yes to opportunities that were now at a larger size than what I used to learn to say no to So and so I've referenced the opportunities that that come to us as like the woman in the red dress familiar with the Matrix is that the thing is that at every opportunity level, as you level up the opportunity to become sexier, right?
2:09
The woman in the red dress becomes more attractive because you know, in the very beginning before you've made any money, anything is attractive.
You say yes to anything.
But then, as you acquire more and more skills, more and more opportunities, open up, and better and better opportunities open up, which is why you have to like, relearn the same.
2:26
Same concept but at a different level, right?
Because at one point you don't say, you say yes to a ten million dollar opportunity or 1 million dollar opportunity.
Everything's Relative, right?
But at another level you have to learn to say no to that if you were above that at that certain time and I think I've made that mistake multiple times at different levels and so I'm partially making this, you know, video for me.
2:49
And so there's a book called The Road Less stupid.
It's really really good.
I'd highly recommend it especially if you're an Nor and especially if you're prone to getting excited about new ideas, constantly wanting to innovate constantly wanting to tweak, and change things, which is really, really, you know, the thing that excites us a lot and it's a lot of times, it's the key to Big breakthroughs that being said, one of the quotes I used to quote, a lot was from Jeff besos.
3:14
You said, basically business business is different from baseball in that, in business, in baseball when you swing for the fences, the most you can ever score is four runs, right?
But in business, every So when you stepped up to the plate, if you hit the ball hard enough, you can score 1000 runs.
3:30
And so big people, who bet, big win big, but they bear the cost of experimentation, right?
And so the he references earlier on in that, in that little address, that he said, if you have a chance of a hundred times payoff and you've got a one at a chance in ten chance of hitting, it should take that bet every time.
3:49
And after having thought about this, I mean Jeff obviously makes a lot more money than I do.
I think that that's not, it's correct.
Correct mathematically, but in practicality, I think there's another sentence that needs to be added to it.
And so to give it a realistic context, imagine you're going to the casino and that's the bet, right?
4:07
That's the bet is you have to put, let's say $10 down and you can win a thousand, but you've got a one out of ten chance, right now.
Here's where it makes it realistic.
Let's say, you only go into the casino with $30, then what you do think about it.
4:25
So that means that if you Bet three times.
You've got a one, you've only got a one out of three chance of ever coming out of the casino with anything, right.
And so that's I think a more realistic Paradigm for what most entrepreneurs going to is because you have a constraint amount of capital money and a constraint amount of time and resources and bandwidth for your team.
4:44
And so kind of adapting that extra sentence on their of just understanding that there's a cost to making that bet.
It's not just oh if I have a 1 out of 10 chance of scoring a thousand, then I I should definitely make that bed every time for a Ten Dollar Bet.
Yes you absolutely should mathematically.
5:01
And in Jeff's case he's had access to unlimited money for virtually unlimited money for 20 years, he's been able to retrace funding and fun.
I mean they have 500 million dollar mess-ups and they're like whoops that didn't work but a lot of us don't have that and so there's in the in the book, The Road Less stupid.
5:19
He gives a context that I think is really really been useful for me even lately and making decisions.
About opportunities, right?
It's the things that I have to say no to.
And so the three questions are really simple, which is why I've been using them so much, which is what's my upside?
5:36
What's my downside?
And can I live assuming that the downside is going to happen.
And so the third question stated a little bit differently, but that's how I'm using it.
And in phrasing, the three questions that way, it's helped me so much in saying, no, right in like man.
5:54
Why don't we try this new follow?
Oh up sequence so that we can get you know, more leads in.
Well, what's the, what's my upside?
Maybe I get a 10 percent boost.
What's my downside?
I lose 50% because the test doesn't work or at bombs because what I'm going against is a control, which is already been tested against other things in is working.
6:14
Hey, if you're a return listener and you have not rated or reviewed the show, I want you to know that you should feel absolutely terrible about yourself and everything else in the world kidding.
But it would mean the absolute world to me.
If you guys would go ahead and do that, you don't have to pause the show, you keep listening and you can just do it with your thumb right now will take you less than 60 seconds.
6:30
And like I said, the only way that podcast arose through word of mouth and this is you joining hands with me and helping as many entrepreneurs with possibly can because no one is coming to save us.
It's just us.
All right, so please go do that now then let's get back to the show.
And can I live with my downside of losing 50% for the hopes of gaining 10?
6:52
No, I can't.
Cause I'm going to assume a minute make that loss.
And so then I just say no and what's happening is it's giving me so much attention back, so that when I'm making my bets because ultimately, if you really think about what businesses at a, it's very basic, it's just betting which is why a lot of entrepreneurs love gambling because it's what we do, we do in a controlled setting.
7:10
It's like you know business is the ultimate version of Poker, right?
Like poker is a combination of skill and Good luck, right business.
I would say is even more skill and still a little bit of luck and so just has more skill under control, but the of the day, they're still bets that were placing.
It's not just on black and black and red.
7:27
It's should I hire a sales person first or should I spend more in this marketing campaign?
Should I test out this new follow-up sequence, or should we try and run, SEO, or should we do cold outbound Messenger, right?
And so, it's like all of these things are decisions where you're choosing between two different opportunities and I think if you Ply that framework.
7:47
That three question framework.
It's been I just like it for me.
It's been a game changer.
It's been so helpful and we've seen, you know, huge reaps.
You know, we've reached the benefit in the business just in the last 90 days.
Even during covid, we've had some explosive growth.
I'll tell you more about it in a couple months but it's been in really trying to hone that discipline and I feel like at every level you get that discipline muscle gets stronger and stronger and stronger and the things that I'm able to say no to get better and better better.
8:14
And so one of the things that if you look at, if you study like Charlie, Munger with it, they talk about the best, the best, betters the best gamblers, actually bet the least frequently, they actually bet the fewest amount of time when they met, they bet big.
8:31
And so, I'm trying to really apply that and when they, when they bet big, they've been on what they call no-brainers, right?
It shouldn't be like you should have in their mind, it virtually.
No, chance of not succeeding.
When you make the BET, right?
Then, if you think about that, then you're like well shoot there's, I mean, when will I ever see those types of bets?
8:51
If you look at them over 40 years, they only have 15 bets that have created, all of the billions that they've been able to generate 1515 winning bets, out of all, the bets they've made have been the winning bets that got them to where they are.
And I think that in business is a lot like that.
So let me just tell you one.
One quick, anecdote to wrap this up to make this real for you.
9:10
Tell me if this sounds realistic, you get really excited about A New Concept, a new idea that you think You're going to test out, right?
And you pitch it to the team.
You let them know what's going to happen.
You're saying, we're starting on Monday.
This could be the new way we do things, the team's not 100% trained up on it, but they're kind of, you know, flies you going to rock and roll with this thing will go.
9:34
And after a month or two months, you look back at your stats and they're pretty much the same maybe even a little bit less.
There's like three other things that happen during that same period of time.
So you're like, I don't know if it was this Where it was because the new process honestly, you know, there's this and that and then all of a sudden you realize that you didn't even get a definitive answer on the test that you ran.
9:56
And you definitely didn't get the result that you were hoping for.
And so, what ends up happening, is that your company and you incurred this enormous cost of change without real, like without any real upside?
And so, in thinking through, that's the making now, I'm assuming the cost and what I mean by like, I'm assuming That I'm going to have the downside, even the one that I'm understanding, but I'm assuming there's going to be some that are unknown, that I'm going to have to incur.
10:22
And so, when I'm making that assumption, which is that third question, which is an, can I live with it assuming that it does happen?
I just like, it's been, it's been so Illuminating for me.
And so helpful for me, because what happens is, you get in these Vicious Cycles especially especially if you're in an emotional situation, right?
10:40
Because I do a lot of, I'm a lot of gym over a lot of business owners in general, right now our cash constrained.
They're trying to figure out what to do.
The trying to Fast make fast decisions on on incomplete information, sometimes that's just the name of the game, right?
But in doing that, they're they're hoping for the Hail Mary.
10:58
And so their internal optimism which is what leads them to be an entrepreneur ends up ends up weighing against them, it ends up stacking the chips against them because that one thing which is been your your hope, right.
Your grace strengths can become your greatest.
11:13
Weakness is an entrepreneur, there's no different, right?
Our Um, ISM can become our Achilles heel because we believe that the chance of success is actually greater than it really is.
And we underestimate the cost of taking the BET and that's where we get fucked, right?
11:28
And so when you go back to the casino and when you're considering the bets and you're like man if this hits, this could be 10 times what we're doing right now, right?
But just remember you only might have three bets to make and you got a one out of ten shot so use them wisely.
11:44
So anyways I hope that was useful for you.
It's been incredibly useful for me.
I've been saying no to way more tests and tweaks and variations.
And and and and just small things that would really distract the team and just saying guys were just going to keep, we're going to keep focusing on executing.
12:01
We're going to keep focusing on doing better at the fundamentals and it continues to pay dividends because the team doesn't have to be scattered.
They just have to think how can we get one percent better every day, rather than 1% better for two weeks, and then change everything and then one percent better for two weeks and then change it.
Anything right?
12:17
Where they never actually get to get that long-term compounding Improvement, which is what ultimately will separate you over time.
So, like I said, oh, that was bad before you.
It's been, it's been a huge lesson for me, and in studying some of the Great's, the all-time greats, seeing how they make decisions, seeing where they Place their bets.
12:35
I wish I had learned it earlier, but hopefully, I can pass, you know, at least that that know, get on to you because been really helpful for me.
So, lots of love, keep being awesome.
Hope you're making Saturday.

Welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
0:48
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Thursday.
This is a little bit less common for me I'm I'm going to make a video or guess podcast depending on how you're consuming this on a pretty Pine that pie-in-the-sky topic and I titled this the new entrepreneurial golden resource now.
1:09
You're probably leaking it.
So a lot of people don't know this but I probably I would say I mentor.
Four or five people on the side, not in a formal business setting in terms of like them, hang me or anything like that.
But just people, that are had become friends that I've taken interest in their business and I've helped them along and invariably.
1:30
And what's interesting is that the higher up, you go, the less tactical, the mentorship is.
And so I had, so I've had, I've had the fortune of actually connecting and befriending my first billionaire friend which is cool.
And what's What's happened as a result of that?
1:47
Is that like I obviously obsessively, look at what people who are doing better than me are doing.
And then when I'm relaying to the people who are I'm trying to help.
There's this one resource that people who make a ton of money manage extremely well and people who do not do not and a lot of people I would say mistakenly think that the number one resource is time, right?
2:10
Everyone's like time is money, time is money, time is money and I would argue that that's not necessarily true.
I would argue that it tension is money and that is the golden resource.
So the billionaire from that I have he's actually been helping me on the new Endeavor that we are launching to our gym Lord's soon, which I think will change the industry.
2:31
And anyways, he's been helping me with that stuff but like here's an example on his phone, his phone does not ring unless you are already a contact that has been whitelisted.
His phone doesn't ring.
It's he's impossible.
To reach, right?
2:47
And the more the more, the more successful, the more, the larger company, grows the more you scale, the more you need to scale a limited scale, you it because you do have a finite amount of attention.
And so, what happens is you have to decrease all of the other things in your life that drain attention because you can have as much time as you want.
3:08
But, if you're not there, you're not potent, you're not able, then you can't get anything done with that time.
That you're supposedly allocating, which is why a lot of people.
End up in this in-between state of always everywhere and at the same time, nowhere, right?
And so they're, they're everywhere, but they're not paying attention to anything.
3:24
And that's in the reason that it's difficult to focus is because entrepreneurs, this, the character trait that made us into entrepreneurs, is that we're go-getters where risk-averse for creators were innovators, were Builders right?
We have all of those traits, but the difficulty is that the thing that gets your 0 to 1 is not the thing that gets you from 1 to 2, right?
3:44
And so one of the, the reason that You have to totally morph and why you have to be a growth-oriented individual is because you have to change your own individual character traits in order to progress as a business owner.
And so like I said the things that got you here and not the things that are going to get you there.
The things that got you here which is your own internal skills are not the things that you need to pass on to other people.
4:02
So the only way that you are able to grow your business.
At a certain point is by growing other people, right?
And the only way you can do that is if you have the attention in the bandwidth in order to do, so, and that's why if you look at a business owner and like the more I obsess on looking at billionaires and people.
Our we're doing better than we are, is I look at how quiet and how clean they keep their space and I mean that both in a literal sense that like their surroundings their office, their their their house, their homes, their cell phone, their computers right there.
4:33
It's quiet, right?
Everything like its pristine.
And when you talk to these people, there's a certain amount of Tranquility that's there and And they just, they just have very little tolerance, and it's not that they're trying to be impatient with you were impatient with the world.
4:50
It's just that they understand that they have set like they're operating at such a high level that there's so many things that are demanding of their time and attention that they just like they can't.
And so they have to forcibly remove themselves from so many different situations and I'm going to give you an example like I'm trying to think of a good one that happened recently.
5:11
So, man, I don't use that one.
Um, okay, so so one of the people that I'm, I'm somewhat mentoring, right?
They had, they had for businesses and this is something that happens so many times.
5:26
It looked like, like, you want, you want 100,000 our coaching.
This is what happens in hundred thousand our coaching sessions.
And I'm being honest with you.
What happens is someone who's coming in usually doing between one and three million dollars a year?
Can't get past a certain point, right?
And the reason they can't get past this because they only have so much attention.
5:44
David spread between four or five different cakes.
That's when the gym owner has four gyms and is making less money than they did.
When they had one gym because the amount of attention that they can allocate to one facility has gone down so much that with fixed costs.
They basically are breaking even, right?
5:59
And so the same thing happens.
Now that entrepreneur is probably making one two, three million dollars in gross revenue, but not taking anything home because they don't have the attention to actually put on two things.
And so in order to You need to do less in order to grow.
You need to do less and that comes from both delegation and also choosing what not to do the better, you get the better, the opportunities that you have to say, no to imagine the level of opportunities that we have.
6:23
Now, I'm just being honest, so imagine how many things we could do or try and JV with or do a partnership with or whatever because of the distribution Network that we have and the trust and the Goodwill that we have at the gym owners that we have in our Network, right?
A lot.
6:39
I get I, you know, how many people cold message me?
Like, I have an opportunity for you.
I'm like, really you have an opportunity for me, right?
And so the better, you get the better, your options.
You have to say no to, which is why becoming a higher and higher and higher level.
Entrepreneur is more and more difficult because it requires discipline.
6:58
It's not about doing more, it's about doing less because we innately want to do more so doing more of your own internal characteristic.
If that was what it took to get to be more successful than everyone would be.
More successful because it would be something that does not take effort because that is something that we already do.
It's like man I don't work any one.
7:14
I've got all this work ethic cool that gets you from 0 to 1.
It's not going to get you any further than that.
So stop.
So stop.
Identifying with that.
It was something that I used to identify with Allah.
I work anyone would have liked that was something that I used to think about and it was a character who has an identity thing and the more you grow, the more you realize that your identity needs to be fluid because what it needs to be, is exactly what it needs to be at That given time of development because the character traits that I'm going to have to emphasize in a year, are going to be different than the ones that I have to emphasize now, right?
7:48
And so the skills that you need to learn like delegation leadership, those are things that are not the things that take you.
In the beginning, you have to be independent, you have to be hustling, you have to be grinding.
You have to be willing to put in the work, because no one else will do it for you.
Especially if you have no Capital start, which most people are on here, are in that situation, right?
8:06
And so to real this back in, The number one thing that you have to be paying attention to is where you are paying your attention, right?
Like you spend attention.
That's why they call it paying attention.
It's because it is a resource.
And most people don't pay attention to that, right?
8:22
And so, one of the things that a lot of people don't know about me, this one's going to go long.
What about some of the things that a lot of people don't know about me?
Is that I for nine months paid a coach to teach me one thing which was to manage my attention.
Was to teach me how to think.
8:39
And so for 90 minutes every single day, all I did was talk about what I was thinking about. think about that, every day, I paid attention to one of my attention was and when I did that, all of a sudden, my business blew up, right?
8:57
And I realized that I had toxic relationships.
I had talks relationship with parents, I had toxic relationships with friends or pseudo, friends things that I, that were taking my attention past things that I had on my mind that I knew, I had not handled.
So those are called, like open Loops or open Cycles.
9:12
Right?
So when you have something that you like, haven't resolved this and you need to handle that, and you get that attention back because what happens is, you have this bowl, this tiny little bowl of marbles of each of those Moses is a unit of attention, right?
If you had to measure it and so you put little marbles of attention on your childhood trauma.
9:29
So you put little Marbles and attention on your marriage.
You put a little help marbles of attention on your health.
You put little marbles attention to your spirituality and then massive marbles of attention on your business.
But the thing is, is that sometimes you need to quiet and collect all of these other little marbles so that you have more potency, more potential energy, more potential units of attention to spend.
9:52
On the one thing that you're trying to grow which in this case would be your business.
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it, share it on Instagram or something like that.
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
10:10
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that, you mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
And what's interesting is that, what happens is that things that were perceived as difficult become really easy.
10:31
And I don't know if you've ever had this happen, but like, if you were in college or you were in high school and you're like, man, I can't solve this problem, it's not a problem and you were exhausted, then you go to bed and you wake up the next morning and then all of a sudden, it seems really easy.
You're like, I don't know why I didn't see that before because attention gives you the ability to see, right?
10:47
Like if you're if you think about wisdom, right, wisdom is inability to see what other people cannot see, right?
Two people are presented the same situation.
The wiser person sees things that the other person does it, and how can you see better?
You see better if you have more ability to see which comes from your most valuable resource attention, how much horsepower do you have, right?
11:06
And so look at the things that you have in your, in your life right now.
Like if I see someone who has a messy relationship, wife, who's got a messy, love life who goes out every weekend and gets trashed, right?
Like I can tell you billionaires, don't do that.
That like the whole Tony Stark, like, vision of the entrepreneur is a farce, it's not true.
11:25
Don't believe that every single billionaire every single high level entrepreneur is quiet.
Unbelievably quiet.
They keep themselves, completely isolated.
They have a bubble around them of layers, of protection there.
Like like for me, it's me.
11:41
And then there's Layla and then we have our CEO and then, we have our executive assistant team because we have a team of EA's.
At this point, we have four who worked the next level.
There's no one who has direct access to Including our employees, no one does and that's because it's it would diss serve you.
12:01
You guys are gym owners if everyone had access to me.
The reason that I don't respond to Facebook message, it is not because I don't want to it's because I literally can't.
And if I did I would be disturbing everyone because then my attention would be split because someone can generate leads in them or whatever, you know what I mean?
12:17
Like, because these little things, these little things that are perceived as huge issues to you in that moment because you have a little bit of attention.
Ian, you have so little left.
That everything seems like an explosion.
But when you have lots of capacity, big problems, seem small and small problems, seem big and it sounds reverse because what you do is you start seeing that all of these, things are attention drains and you just say I don't want to play anymore.
12:42
And you stop playing.
And then all of a sudden, everything gets really simple because the only things you have to do become really simple at our gym, wrote about one of the things that we had to do.
Our that I had, everyone do was simply to find the number that they needed to have in their Gym.
12:58
Number of, you have TS in order to have the lifestyle that they wanted to have really simple simple process, most people didn't have that, right?
But it's amazing.
What happens when you have Clarity?
Because it allows you to put your attention in.
Direction.
Right?
13:13
And then it gives you a litmus test.
Will this help me grow this number?
Yes or no.
Yes, cool.
Let's do it.
No, ignore it, right?
And it takes discipline to say, ignore it takes discipline.
That's why it's hard.
That's why most entrepreneurs aren't successful.
That's why most Farmers.
13:28
Don't grow is because it's hard.
It's counterintuitive, it's counter your character.
And so you have to learn how to not be yourself in order to be the person that you want to be.
And that's why, that's why most people don't do it.
And so to go ridiculously full circle on this.
Every time I meet with an entrepreneur and I felt like told you we coaches probably a loose term but I'll meet with a few handful of entrepreneurs on a semi-regular basis in to see, how's it going?
13:54
And the question that I always ask is what's your attention, please?
Your attention, right?
And if someone comes in, they seem really, really like scattered.
I already know that their attentions all over the place, they're super spread that they're less able.
So of course, they can't grow their business because they don't have the very horsepower, the main resource that allows them to Grow and push, right?
14:13
And so look at your life, look at your relationship with your spouse.
Loved one.
Look at your habits, how you wake up?
How you eat you exercise, do you drink?
Here's an example for why we stopped drinking, all right?
And it has nothing to do with any kind of like there's no religious anything regardless.
14:31
We stopped drinking because I realized that I would drink at night on a fairly regular basis.
Not like I always had some issue with that.
I really didn't.
I mean, I drink a lot, but I just whatever the point is, this Is that I would, I would drink in the evenings because I would say it would help me just distress, help me unwind.
14:47
But what that does, is it masks?
The thing that is taking my attention that I have anxiety on, right?
And so, if you need to take a drink to unwind that, it means you have things that you have not resolved.
And so one by one, what happened is that when I stopped drinking everything got really loud.
15:05
And so I had to face and confront the things that I had not resolved yet.
And so, in the beginning, it's a Artist.
But then what happens is once you've actually resolves, all of those things, the desire to drink goes away, because you're like, well, I actually feel really good right now.
I don't want to mess that up and so it flips.
15:22
But it took, it took probably six months for that to happen for me and so I'm just giving that as an example of of what of what having your attention split and kind of getting gaining that attention back can be.
So look at your life.
Look at your relationships.
15:38
Look at your habits and the things that are taking your attention.
You need to handle Complete the cycles and get the attention back so you can work on the one thing that you're trying to grow and if you have side hustles inside businesses, get rid of kill me.
That's what people like people come and they pay us tons of money to tell them do one thing and the only reason that they listen is because we make one and I'm telling you right now, that's what I would do.
16:02
You want them?
Focus.
Do you want them?
Focus, say meet again.
That's why most times when someone comes into like, hey, I want to start an online business.
In a food prep business and, and, and up whatever, right?
All at the same time because one of them is going to take off, it doesn't work that way.
16:20
All of them could take off.
You could have a billion-dollar food prep business.
You could have a billion-dollar gym business like your business, like having more businesses is a farce.
I was talking to a gym owner of the other day and he's like, yeah, I mean, two paychecks is better than one and I was like, no one fat.
Paycheck is better than two.
16:38
You can have a hundred million dollar roofing business, right?
It just prepares Roots.
You don't need to do General Contracting and also windows and also gutters and roofs.
You can just do one thing and be really, really, really, really, really good at it and make as much money as you want.
And so just break that belief of yourself of like I have to have three things in order to make more money, you know, you don't you don't it's not true.
16:59
You one thing I'd someone who's in the real estate space who was doing real estate coaching after her first month of being in the coaching called me up and was like Just not enough real estate agents.
She was doing like two hundred thousand dollars a month and I was like real estate agents as like how how small of a marketing micro gym owner is as a you literally outnumber my market 100 to 1 and I was like can we are out doing outpacing?
17:23
Your Revenue, 20 21.
Right.
It's just these beliefs that we have that are silly.
And I can tell you that, the the higher up, you go all of those limiting beliefs disappear and you just see people who operate a very high level, very quiet, very clean.
17:39
They're like if someone walks in the door and it's any negativity, those people just get up and leave nothing personal.
I just can't have that in my life, right?
Someone complains someone's - this is whether our traffic set like worries.
I'm just going to get up and go.
It's nothing personal, but that's how they handle themselves.
So thank you guys for your attention.
17:56
I hope I gave you You a positive return on it.
That was my intention.
This wasn't a normal type of video that I would normally make but it was something that was like on my mind and I just had two or three calls recently where I had told people to consolidate their businesses, get rid of one, two or three businesses.
18:15
And then within a matter of 30 days, two of those people had a multiple of 3 X on their total revenue between of what they were doing before within the 30-day period just by getting their attention back.
So look at what you can consolidate.
18:30
Lots of everyone.
I appreciate you.
So look at what you can consolidate.
Lots of everyone.
I appreciate you.








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
The vast majority of people People hate change more than they hate losing and would rather just lose.
Welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
0:44
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
We're in a place right now where remote is selling like hotcakes and the vast majority of people hate change more than they hate losing and would rather just lose because they were so burned out of being gym owners that this gave them a perfectly acceptable except the Emma's, right?
1:04
They can look at their parents, they could look at their wife and they're like, you know, I tried my hardest and everyone's going to say you're right, who is going to guess Corona was going to happen.
It's not on you and so if you want to quit this is the absolute best opportunity to quit.
But if you're not that person and you want to win, this is how you do it, and you can do it now.
1:21
Because the people who actually execute right now lead costs are 50% off right now because no one's marketing, especially other gyms in your area.
How's it going?
Everyone and welcome to the fitness Founders podcast.
I'm Kevin mannion VP marketing here at go.
Fox this week.
We talk to the great Alex.
From 0z author of Jim launch Secrets.
1:38
Alex talks about how to make your online business and revenue.
Driving machine, creating value and accountability for your members and the key to mastering sales over the phone.
It's a master class.
So let's get started.
Alex from 0z at, welcome to the show.
1:58
Thanks for having me, appreciate it.
Yeah, so you're pumping out, content yourself, and I really want to give you a platform for our listeners to get some key.
Takeaways now, the world has changed and how they how they kind of doctor that will be businesses out there that are ahead of their so they're doing really well.
And there's other ones that are probably Paralyzed by fear and uncertainty Arie like to start there at the start and maybe tell us a little bit around the mindset.
2:22
People need to have now you know, that the sky Has fallen in house, they be thinking about their their businesses.
Also you to kind of, I would say, major points.
First one is one of their panic.
Panic is just an expression of pain.
I just larger pain within the marketplace, right?
That's what Panic is.
2:37
And so whenever there's lots of paint means, there's always lots of problems.
And problems means opportunities to be solved.
And so when there's always panic and means that you can make lots of profit if you are able to realign your services with what people want now.
And so if you're no longer able to fulfill in the way you are accustomed to, the problem will still exist weight loss.
2:54
And changed, right?
People still want to be healthy.
It's just, can you pivot the way you provide the services into a different Channel?
And most of us already have the skill set to provide, you know, nutrition coaching accountability, Etc.
And if you can make the pivot, then you can actually meet an outsize demand, where there's less supply of it.
3:11
And so, if you've looked at over the last 30 days online training, depending on the source, what you're looking at is from between 5 x + 9 x, just for the last 30 days.
And that's because the vast majority of the population, general population is still behind the curve.
Curve in terms of understanding online.
3:27
I mean many people in every been on the zoom call until like this month and so it gives us an opportunity as gym owners to kind of pivot our clientele in the marketplace that we're in local or even beyond that lead to a higher profit model which is one of the opportunities that exist because online, training and remote training has far higher margins than in-person brick-and-mortar service.
3:48
Yeah, I think that's really interesting and I, you know, we just kind of really dig dig in there a little bit deeper.
Taking the idea of in the future being potentially a more profitable business model other.
If we start with say operations and then maybe retention.
4:04
What are some people that you're, you know, working with doing to cut back on what they're spending and retain the people that are already paying them?
Yep.
So first thing, is that any business when they're in a constrained environment, has to focus on Revenue, generating activities.
4:21
And so every employee and remember if you've Model you can never have the mindset of.
I have to create work for someone.
You have to create a business model and then people either fit in that model, they don't.
And so right now, if you're in a remote setting, people are either retaining your existing customers, or they are generating revenue from new clients from sales, that's all there is honestly, a remote gym.
4:45
Setting is actually a more operationally simple model than an in-person model, the difficulties and online acquisition.
If you crack, the Part.
And you actually have a very, very, very sound model because the compensation structure for remote way that we promote it within our community is, is an 80/20 split.
5:03
So the coaches will get 20% of the recurring revenue from the members that they're maintaining and eighty percent goes to the business.
And so the difference is that, if you are fulfilling online, then you don't have the rent.
You don't necessarily have the front desk.
Girl, you don't have the cleaning, you don't have the toilet paper.
You don't have this at the variety of things that come along with that.
5:21
And so you can actually run a very high gross.
Business higher, gross margin business.
So that $200 a month they used to get in person.
You may only collect 12 and a half percent which is the industry average in terms of profit.
But instead of that go to a much higher 50, maybe 60, 70 percent margin, in terms of what you actually can take home after, you know, the smaller cost that are associated with software.
5:41
Etc.
Yeah and I think there's like obviously lots of immediate things you can do to cook the money that's going out of the business, but some people I think are still struggling with how do they keep.
People paying them, just at the very Basics.
5:56
I 50 people pay me a hundred bucks a month.
Yep.
And they were coming in and things were fine and now, I don't know.
Should I put them all on pause?
Or what should I do?
Yeah, now I'm not a lawyer and these laws differ by a dream state, but my recommendation to our community has been don't pause people.
6:15
You just have to ship what you are fulfilling.
And so ultimately, you said you were going to help these people lose weight and you that promise has not changed, you're still even delivering the services in a different Manner.
And so So, the primary thing and this is what everyone who's in the fitness space has to understand is that you're not going to be Beachbody at online workouts.
6:33
Not in seven days on your budget.
It's not man.
You're not going to be Precision Nutrition on nutrition, right?
You're not going to beat them on like the quality of your nutrition plans and so what are the competitive advantages that a small business owner has in a local or super local Marketplace?
6:49
It's accountability.
All right, it's service.
What we do is not selling Zoom workouts, you can have them so that you can fulfill on it, you know, Jim launch.
We provide 16 hours a day of one our workouts that we do.
Ooh for our community.
So we decided to centralize that for us.
So that all of our genes could even cut more things off their plate.
7:07
And so that if you were to simplify the business model, you have sales, sorry, if marketing.
So lead generation, you have lead, nurture, which we automate.
And then you have your sales, appointments, beyond the sales appointment.
The only thing that's happening in fulfillment is just one on reach outs, one-on-one, reach out.
7:23
So it's accountability the primary value that the fitness professionals providing in a remote setting is the gap between what people think they should be doing.
Doing and what they are actually doing.
Everyone knows they need to stop eating.
I do my other pessimist.
Yeah, you can say what you want.
7:38
Okay.
It's like people need people know.
They need to stop eating shit and move, right?
They all know that and they can Google nutrition plan.
They can Google free online work out.
So you're not going to you're not going to differentiate or provide value in excess in that way.
Well you are going to be provided value is getting them to do the thing that they are not doing People pay for you to pay attention, you need to shift your mindset from.
8:02
I was in person in the now I'm remote to I was doing Group Training and now I am one on one and if you can make that pivot in your own mind that, oh my gosh.
I'm giving personal training is essentially personal coaching for dramatically less than what I would provide one-on-one coaching for an in-person setting.
8:19
Then you can start seeing where the value of scrappin.
See create something that someone would want to pay the same amount that they pay for their gym membership for in a boutique setting for, you know, 150, each other donors mode.
I think what you're saying at a high level is, there's a lot of people that may be still trying to figure out how to get the zoom.
8:34
The zoom workouts perfected and they maybe even afraid to get them started both.
There may be missing a trick in starting from first principles here and thinking, why were people paying me $250 in the first place?
And maybe the workout is obviously going to be a big part of a but maybe the work, as isn't the most important thing that I can offer while I'm remote.
8:56
I would even make the argument It was never the most important thing they offer.
It's just most people don't know that, even the people are in the business, right?
If they wanted group workouts, you can go to the YMCA or the globo gym and they have group work dots on the hour, every hour in large groups.
For probably one tenth of what, you're charging.
9:13
Yeah.
So, it's never been the workouts great.
It's been the service in the community, but you can't sell Community, right?
You saw the result when someone walks in the door, but they stay because the relationship that they have with you the coaches and the other people who they work out with, right.
And so, we'll all we're doing is Fast-tracking meet, deliberate about our actions to intentionally.
9:31
Create that relationship and make sure that the communication Kate is that we have operationally matches maintaining that relationship and then growing it so that the bond, they're still feels even more intimate than it was in the in-person setting.
So I think the first thing people do is primarily going to be weight loss.
9:47
But thinking, you know, why were people coming to me in the first place?
And then really thinking, how can I create that accountability?
How can I to a certain degree, keep that Community aspect going as well?
And just as I supposed to recap for everyone like watch, what are people doing to keep that accountability.
10:04
Going this is communication cycle.
So what we recommend is that you have to have some things that are expected of the client and some things that are expected of the coach and the coach is there to make sure that the person thing the birthing is the clients are supposed to do are actually getting done and so fundamentally, you want the client to have to do as little as possible because if you have them have to fill out a 17 questionnaire form once a week, the likely that they do is very low, they are not us.
10:26
They actually don't care about And so it has to be as minimally invasive as possible.
I would even go so far as to say, you don't even mean the special apps and like, you don't need to worry about that stuff because you can just text people like you don't have to be fancy with this.
10:43
Because that is the that's the vehicle that the customer is most accustomed to communicating with.
And so all you have to do is be structured on the back end so that, you know, that what they're required to do, is text you every day, they're morning weight.
And Is that they were supposed to be taking and then boom, by the way, tie and some supplement Revenue into your business.
11:02
Because right now, supplements are up, 30% is a category.
People want to buy products of them to do that.
They're doing it anyways.
They might as well do it for you, especially from a recommendation from an authority, so have them send their weight.
And the reason you want to do a daily as for a couple reasons, one is, it keeps them honest, right?
Because if the only way in weekly one you have massive variability from week to week from way out to way into way because if they weigh in the morning or the afternoon or they ate, they drank a glass of water that can be were very, but they always do it first thing in the morning.
11:29
You know, after they pee it's going to even out and you actually have way better data, that's number one.
But from a psychological standpoint they know that if they're looking at the big sleeve of Oreos when they're hungry at night and they know they have to win the next morning even though calories and fat loss, don't work that way.
They are as a general population going to not do it or be less likely the whole sleeve.
11:47
Maybe one or two knowing that they can't they can't get away with it because their coaches to see their weight in the morning.
Now, for you as the coach, because that's what they're required to do, all you need to do is acknowledge that you received it on two of the days of the week.
And then the other three days a week, you want to be proactive in your reach out to them.
12:04
And ask you specifically catered question right now, what are the three aspects that we want to look at with a client?
Typically?
You're going to be looking at their Fitness.
So you're going to say, hey, how did we do this last week on our workouts?
And remember workouts, as defined in a remote setting is movement.
12:21
If you really want to have like long term sustainable like how thought we lost interventions.
Getting someone to walk for 30 minutes away is probably better than them over a four-year times than anything else is.
Anyways, so don't be a purist about this.
It's just getting them to move.
So asking whether they actually did this thing they committed to?
12:38
That's number one.
The second time you'll reach out that week, maybe it's Wednesday, doesn't matter.
We have our clients separate out the clients attitude Monday, Wednesday, Friday, and Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, that way.
It decreases their their Reach Out load per day.
Yeah.
The second reach out is going to be about nutrition, right system like hey how you doing with your food right?
12:56
Are you eating 10 bags of Oreos?
Every day you can finish off a bag of chips, or we relatively stay in, to where we need to be.
That's the second piece.
The third, you know, reach out is going to be about their their energy, their head space.
Their sleep kind of how they're doing overall, to make sure that they know that you're a human being and that, you know, that they're human.
13:11
And so if you can't, you don't ask the same question, right?
You got to be a person.
But if you ask the questions along those lines, that gives you very easy fodder to work off of to create Organic conversation that allows you to have a one-on-one relationship with the clients at scale.
If we were to summarize, this overall blueprint of that's what that's called.
13:29
Keeping the business going, we're talking cut back to Cassio.
You can you know stem the tides of your pauses and cancellations and fill that in which, obviously certain amount is going to be online workouts, but you're going to have to dedicate time to keep that one-to-one one-to-many relationships going with the goal to keep people accountable.
13:47
Keep them engaged with you and in the end of the day, that's going to be worth.
It for them because they're still going to stay on the same path for the fitness goals.
So we're trainer.
So if you're looking at your staff, right, and you have a front desk person and you've got two trainers.
And you, if you were to allocate the way your times gonna go, you probably don't need the front desk person.
14:05
I'm just giving you real, like, let's be real, okay?
You probably don't need that because there's no front desk right there.
Not greeting.
Every so someone now the trainer's they can do split shifts they can do for work.
That's the more the other person before actually afternoon that works.
They both should be if you want to know relative client load for remote is about 75.
14:24
Clients is about a full-time remote client for a coach.
If they have 75 clients, it should take them about three hours a day.
Did you all of them in your reach out some responses?
Beyond that the remainder of their day should be on cold regions.
All right.
That means messaging people making posters finding people who comment or like and asking them if they know anybody who'd be interested in, not gaining the quarantine cysteine and so when they do that, they become Revenue.
14:50
Generators not just revenue, maintainers or preservers, and so, they're actively maintaining revenue for you by keeping your assisting customers.
Happy delivering, a higher level of service.
This is something that every gym owner has to really truly believe in their gut.
So they don't feel like they're taking Take advantage of people.
Like you are providing a one-on-one solution where you did not have a one-on-one solution before this and you're doing it at a fraction of what one-on-one coaching would typically cost you need to make sure that from a maintaining of your gym membership, communication used to say hi.
15:18
So if you're used to, you know, sending out a weekly email.
You got to be thinking about daily, not necessarily just emails, but text Facebook group posts and you have to be more active on social media, because everyone's on their, right?
Everyone's bored at home, cooped up waiting for people to respond to their comments and threats, right?
15:34
You're going to have to be more active with that.
That was the gym owner, right?
Is the proprietor, your primary goal is revenue generation.
That is what you need to be doing.
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
15:54
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, It's the last thing you want to do is stop sales and marketing for a variety of reasons.
One, the moment you stop acquiring, new customers is the month, is the moment you start the ticking time, clock of when you're going to die, right?
16:14
Because attrition is going to happen, no matter what.
Even when you're in person attrition happens, if you're not feeling it back up, eventually your gym will die and you don't know how long this is gonna last.
So number one, you don't want to stop sales and marketing.
Number two, we're in a place right now where remote is selling like hotcakes and the vast majority of people hate.
16:35
Change more than they hate losing and would rather just lose because they were so burned out of being gym owners that this gave them a perfectly acceptable except Deanna's right?
They can look at their parents they could look at their wife and they're like you know I tried my hardest and everyone's going to say you're right who is going to guess Corona was going to happen it's not on you and so if you want to quit this is the absolute best opportunity to quit.
16:57
But if you're not that person and you want to win, this is how you do it and you can do it now because the people who actually execute right now lead costs are 50. percent off right now because no one's marketing, especially other gyms in your area, we're talking the top five percent of gym owners are actually even marketing with And here's the good news, if you are the top 5%, guess what happens when half the gyms go out of business in 90 days, right?
17:20
Because they only have 14 days to cash flow and hint.
All those members get released back in the marketplace and then you swallow the whole thing back up.
By the end of this, you can reopen your gym and then still have people who stayed in a remote setting.
Because believe it or not, there are a lot of people actually, like, working out on their own convenience and not having to leave and go places, right?
17:38
It may actually work better for your customers and that's okay because higher-margin service.
And so what happens is you start to adapt?
What's called hybrid to model?
You have both remote services and you have in-person services And so you have to do Revenue stream and the secondary Revenue stream.
The remember of the stream is not tear graphically confined and is higher profit.
17:57
That makes a lot of sense.
I just want to move through the sections here, so I think summarizing on the retention, like it's actually a very good point that for in the time it takes to do a 45 minutes one on one training session but maybe do 45 reach outs or 101 Communications and really think about time and how you're paying your trainers and what value can get out of them when they're Flatout doing it.
18:20
They doing this training moving in to the sales and marketing a lot of businesses.
Now, probably are shutting down their sales cost cutting down in marketing costs, but getting into the mindset of actually growing and not just grow to grow, but grow to survive because there's definitely going to be some attrition, that's really important point, but I think it kind of comes to the next question that I have which is, you know, you would be very well known in the industry for constructing sales pitches.
18:49
He's instructing offers, you know, we often associate you with high value high, price introductory offers all this kind of stuff.
What is the Playbook now?
Prosperity Doctrine is grow Thrive, etcetera, like transform.
19:07
All of that works in every type of normal economy.
As soon as you're in a recessionary economy, the buying Behavior flips, and it goes through preservation.
If you look at any of the advertisements, right, we have right now, I'm not talking about selling your gym.
I'm talking about saving and surviving Etc.
19:23
Because right now surviving is what people believe is possible and what's interesting is in a recessionary economy.
The bye.
Demand on Survival is twice as high as the desire to buy for growth is during a normal economy, right?
19:39
So, the actual buying demand is for 21 for preservation in a recessionary economy, versus 2214 growth in a normal economy.
So, if you flip your language, you'll be able to convert more people.
That's number one.
Number two, in terms of construction, the offer, you still absolutely be, should be selling.
19:56
I would say, I'm a put quotes around this higher ticket up front.
Now higher ticket in a recessionary economy right now.
Now what we're seeing is 299 is a price point.
That's converting to Coal traffic in a local market remote services.
And so, we present a very simple, a be offer for someone to do, you know, 21 day or 28 day, or doesn't really matter, but a front-end challenge of some sort, mmm.
20:17
And then with that 299, or you can become a member today, very simple.
And the downsell for that is just simply starting them on a weekly billing Cadence.
You start them at 49 bucks a week or 39 bucks a week and that's Three swallowable for a lot of people and it's a lower trust environment so it allows you to gain their trust.
20:37
You don't want to stop at the for sale.
So what you're saying earlier ballet choreographing sales experience is definitely what we did.
I've known for is that there's three sales that should happen.
This happens with whether you're in a recessionary economy or not, you should always build the mousetrap so that you can maximize the value they provide.
And then also the value that you can get for the business.
20:54
And so the first is going to be your service to this is a front and service sales.
So that's what I just said, the 299 versus the council for, you know, 4939 Let's build weekly.
The second sale is going to happen in 24 to 48 hours later where you go through nutrition consultation.
We use this as an onboarding experience to provide more value, walk them through.
21:13
Make sure they understand everything who their coaches are, where the groups are where the contact for billing Bible, teaching them how to be a client, but also providing value in the nutrition.
Especially right now, in quarantine people going to want to know what they can do within their current environment.
This is a point where you then also have a soft recommending for supplements for us.
21:33
We have reach $200 per head, in supplement sales, and most guys, make a forty percent commission on what they sound substance.
You're talking 80 to 100 dollars a head in profit per person in additional within the first 24 to 48 hours now that alone can typically cover the cost of acquisition for a customer, which means your front end, service Revenue was 100% gravy, right?
21:53
Is profit on top and then on top of that.
So we've gotten the first two sales to service them interesting sale.
The third sale should happen at day 14.
All right, so when you're doing a 28-day to see me halfway through, if you don't turn one day, be two weeks in.
So, at this point, you should have gained a certain amount of trust.
22:09
You should already had at least seven or eight exchanges with this person one-on-one, keeping them on track.
Make sure they're doing a good job and this point you should be able to talk to them in a real way.
With true Rapport, you don't talk about their long-term goals and at that point, you can sell at the real price points that you're accustomed to selling to even get repaid, you know, two thousand dollar-plus S Sales.
22:30
Now remember this is my recommendation to use continue to sell in the remote setting.
You don't need to sell for when they come back because then you're still selling a disadvantage and you don't know what's going to happen.
So continue to sell for the 101 remote experience that this person is already enjoyed, and it's got results from again, a.
22:45
So they seem to you, they're like, I see how you've changed the value proposition.
So, I see how you've changed it from, Survival or, you know, avoiding going backwards rather than making massive gains, but you're still talking big numbers in terms of what you can earn in Revenue.
23:02
Before this, our guys were selling to 3,000 up front on the first visit.
So this is this is significantly less.
So typically, what we would do is a diagnostic selling process at the first visit, which is actually what that last cell it is described.
Were you talking to the long-term goal and then selling a package to the goal, right?
So it's like, hey, you know, if you want to lose 40 pounds, it's going to take us 20 weeks to get there and then another maybe 10 to 15 weeks to maintain it.
23:24
Feed you back up to A higher calorie intake so that we can maintain that lower body weight at a higher calorie intake.
So you basically feed them back up and so that total package might be let's say 30 or 40 weeks, right?
And so when you sell 30 weeks at 999, you have a three thousand dollar package.
23:40
You can say hey, prepay today, and save 20%.
Now your 2400 person says, no say coolest, do half down was to 1200.
Can you do that and then weekly payments, you spread it out.
They can't do that.
You do 600 then spread it out.
And so you keep your working your way down in the nice piece is that if you have a high pricing, by the time you get to 600 bucks after saying, 4,000 for the people who are less skilled labor to get yeses, very, very frequently.
24:04
And so if anyone who's listening, this is like man.
I can barely close to ninety nine dollar membership, it's because your value proposition straight up, it's not because your Market is weak.
It's not because you lack the skill of closing High ticket, that's all it is.
And you need to understand how to provide value to a person in a setting.
24:20
So I think Baby to round off for somebody who's in the situation where they're not used to selling over the phone.
And, you know, they probably running a business that people have been walking into and having a good experience and maybe they're struggling at The $99 price point.
24:38
What's the fastest way they can figure out how to do this?
Over the phone.
There is no fast way of doing it.
I mean fast.
Yes, there is, but there's no way of like home working your way through it.
You can only watch trainings for so long.
And at a certain point you need to Dive In The Water.
24:53
You need to step in the ring and get punched in the face.
You can watch all the UFC you want.
It doesn't mean you can fight, you have to.
And what we've seen is 25 to 30 exposures to a stressor which is General stress Theory to it's not just sales, right?
Guess people basically desensitized to the stress associated, with a new selling environment after 25 sales.
25:13
What we've seen is argemone or 25.
Sales opportunity is our gym.
Owners are able to convert the same numbers, they were closing in person, right?
It just basically takes 25.
Attempts of sucking to kind of figure out the flow of how the script works.
I can give you the words to say right now but it's not about the words.
25:30
Words are 20% of it. 80% of his, how you say the words, it's the tonality and the frame, you can control in the sale.
And so I'm going to just give you two examples really quickly because I think it would it would drive the point home.
So if I said before we start in the sale.
So do you, do you need to talk to your husband before we get going, you know, make any decisions by asking that question the way I just did.
25:51
You're going to think I should say yes to this.
Now if I ask the same question and I said you don't need to talk to your husband or anything before you started.
You're going to think.
No, I don't need to talk to my husband.
I said the same words more or less, right?
But the tonality will dictate what the response is.
26:09
And so you can get the words, but how you say?
The words matters, more than the words themselves.
I'm sure, you've maybe maybe for the same example of like, what are you doing?
First is, what are you doing for sis?
What are you doing?
All of those things are, different meanings to the same sentence and so learning how to inflict your voice.
26:31
I know this sounds silly but like in phone sales, you don't have the luxury of having your in-person body language which allows people who are less skilled to be able to get away with shit your sales.
And so sung in a new environment, creates more discipline salesperson.
The fun to note about this is that when you sell over, the phone tends to be less tiring than in person, Which is one of the advantages.
26:52
You can take a higher volume of sales per day, over the phone without getting exhausted.
I think they don't think it would take away from that is the 25.
Everyone has a list and really just gotta start working as, and trial.
And error is probably the best way to actually get moving.
27:07
But it's going to take a little bit of resilience to actually start doing it before you figure out the best cop.
It's like, what's the expectation, you know, you have a client who comes in and they watch them squat videos and then they come in and they try to squat and it doesn't look right there.
Li God squatting is not for me, you know?
Like of course, of course you suck it.
27:23
Phone sales.
You've never done it before.
Why would you think you'd be good?
You think after 10, 10 attempts at something?
You've only spent five hours trying to do a skill that you're going to be world-class.
It is to go from high school, have 4,000 hours over the phone sometimes unrealistic, expectations of acquiring a skill that being said, it is 100% the skill.
27:40
You have to acquire in order to survive.
So I'm going to have to toughen up because you can't get new people without selling over the phone right now.
So, it's just like, what are you gonna do?
You just gotta confront it.
It just got to get hit in the face and just keep moving.
That's a good point.
Okay.
The last topic for a couple of minutes is about the future.
27:57
So what do you see six months time or whenever that is and doors?
Start to open again?
What's a business business?
Going to look like how much this is going to be digital?
I'm, which is going to be in person.
What's going to happen?
Great question.
I don't have the Magic Ball, but if I were to be a betting person, which I guess, I am is wrong business one.
28:18
I think that this will fundamentally change the way that people consume.
Finish with technology.
I think this will also fund, only shift the way people purchase the gym owners, who learn how to sell over the phone will realize, the cellular phone is actually a more efficient way to sell.
It is a more efficient way to so it's harder.
But once you learn the skill, you can actually convert a higher percentage of your leads, no matter what.
28:36
Number two there will be some people who are going to stay online.
They realize they've never they never had they got forced to overcome the hump of learning the new technology but now that they're doing it.
They're like, you know what, I like working out from home, this is actually Or convenient for me, right and convenience will always win.
28:54
That being said, there's still going to be a big explosion of people who are crawling out of their skin, wanting to go back to the gym, and there's going to be far fewer James that are alive when this opens up.
So I think that the demand for Fitness services in person will still outmatch the supply.
When this turns back on I also don't think it's going to be as much of a boom is people expect because I think most countries are not going to turn their economies back on like a light switch.
29:17
I think it's be more like a dimmer switch.
It's going to be certain areas for certain people and Certain ages for certain types of businesses and gyms are going to be one of the last ones because we're not essential and we're highly contagious.
So we're going to have to deal with this, in my opinion, for the foreseeable future and putting your head in the sand and wishing.
29:33
And Waiting for Superman to come, it's not going to solve the problem.
If you're not doing something right now you have to because you won't make it long enough to get to the other side in mind, sounds like things were learning.
Now, this skills, like phone sales and online relationships, are the things that are going to be part of Of every Fitness business for a long time.
29:53
I mean it's my remaining nine months ago, we started something called a hybrid gym program which it is basically a spouse this exact thing which is providing one-on-one accountability services for your members and using this an upsell for an additional forty, nine dollars a week and so what that did was allow boot camps to who cares, crossfit's etcetera to charge $100 a week, 400 to 500 dollars a month for the same services and adding a high high margin service on top to maximize profit.
30:21
And retain customers for a longer period of time than Group Training does on its own.
Now that you build the construct and infrastructure being learn how to fulfill a remote setting one-on-one, it opens up your geography.
So you actually can pull from other areas as one to the people who do come back, you can add this as a bolt on service on top of your existing membership, so you can drive more profit and then third, we're gonna have some people just going to prefer to do that.
30:41
And you just keep them at that $200 a month in a high profit service.
Yeah, makes a lot of sense.
We've covered an absolute ton of ground there at today.
I just my last question before we finish is, you know, what's the biggest lesson you've learned in the last two or three weeks?
30:59
Well, if it's a lesson with a reminder winners win right now, if you were listening to this and you're not sure what to do that, includes you.
And the only thing that separates people who don't win from the who do is once you try.
And so as long as you continue to try, you can't lose Because that's really what it comes down to.
31:18
I had wish I had something sexier for you, but that's just what it is.
And if you see any person who succeeding, right now, there's a gym owner, and there are tons right now we're killing it.
It means you can too.
Okay, I smell co-author of Jim launch Secrets.
Everybody read the book.
Thank you very much for coming on the show.
31:36
Appreciate it.
Thanks for being.

Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur because I think that there's nothing that really can grow you faster than growing a business.
Glee because you have to just continue to level up as person in order to grow and Lead everybody.
0:35
Welcome to the gym Seekers podcast.
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way, I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Protect ourselves from our emotions is information and data because it's just facts, right?
0:53
And so it's but I think a lot of times people are trying to protect their own emotions by avoiding it because it's maybe not what they want to see.
Good morning.
This is Eric Leclair over at push press and we are continuing our in the trenches series with a look at Deep look into leadership.
1:13
And over the past couple of years we have had some substantial men and women leading from the front, not just from the gym owner space but from the entrepreneurial space when I got a chance to sit back as a gym owner and look at who is providing help, who was providing.
1:30
Direction or motivation.
I can't think of a group or a Duo better than the hormones.
These and so today, I am so honored to be interviewing, but at the same time connecting at both, the friendship level as well as a business level with Layla, her Mosey.
1:47
And so for those that may not know which at this point in 2020, I can't imagine, we don't know.
But by all means Layla.
Thank you for coming on today and feel free if you want to introduce yourself.
Yeah, I appreciate it.
Eric, I'm excited to be here.
Yeah, I'm Layla.
2:03
Her mozi.
I am the co CEO and co-founder of Jim launch as well as Prestige labs and Alan all of which originated as businesses that serve gym owners and now Elm software has kind of branched out to all brick and mortar facilities.
2:21
I started the business with my husband about four and a half years ago and we Mound Bumble actually Funny story for like, how do you start working together?
I'm like, well, we met we went on a date and then he was like, hey, you should work for me and I was like, what do you like?
2:38
Oh, yeah, like this is weird and just keep it short.
But, you know, essentially, I think three weeks after we met, we just found each other really interesting.
We had all the same interests in terms of business and in our personal lives and so before we even like, became a couple or really like decided, we even wanted to date each other, we did decide that we want to work.
2:59
Together.
And so I remember I came over to his house after work.
One day I was personal training in person online, at that point and there was a booklet and it was like a Moleskine binder and it said like Jim launch LLC.
And I was like, you did it.
He was like, yeah, I thought we're gonna start this.
3:15
And I was like, all right, cool.
And then three weeks after that, it's about six weeks.
After we met, we started flying out to different gyms and basically testing our marketing and sales and then fulfillment, practices their did.
Like 11 months.
So we basically like go out and dig a Hired Gun for Jim.
3:34
Yeah, while we were in their marketing and so he'd be in Virginia.
I've been Hawaii, he'd be an Oklahoma being Florida.
We did that for a while which was freaking exhausting.
But I work, I seriously grew and learn more than ever in my entire life.
3:50
And after that, we expanded and we hired a team and we flew them out to go do that.
And then shortly realized that wasn't really a sustainable model.
Just because It's really interesting, right?
Everyone wants 100 new members until you give them 100 new members and then they're like you just fucking broke my whole business.
Like what the hell?
4:08
And so, it's like second-order consequences and 100 new members.
You have a million new problems.
You do your old ones, but you have just as many people new ones, and so realize that people needed to do it themselves in order to grow into the kind of person who could fulfill for that many people.
And so we kind of accidentally, we thought were going to get out of that and just do straight b2c online.
4:29
This actually started doing it.
We're doing really well with me as the face of a weight loss company and that day out called up all the people we had lined up for the next two months that we are flying people out to their gyms and he said, listen, I can't do this, I guess just not working, you know, we're getting out of the gym space and they all said my gyms can go under if you don't help me, like, I need someone to help like please, and so that day, he ended up saying yes to about eight gym owners and they said, we'll pay you, you only ascending when out just teach us.
4:59
Is he had never wanted.
Like, if anyone, it's so funny because Alex always said music, I didn't ever want to be a coach or Guru, like I literally detest that I got depressed face and, and he is like one of the ultimate now, so that was run.
Jen, Jen Wang says, it kind of began started and were, you know, four and a half years into it and we started the supplement line Prestige labs and we start our software Allen.
5:22
And so, it's just been, it's been really, really cool experience because I think that there's nothing that really can grow you.
Nothing growing a business quickly because you have to just continue to level up as person in order to get grow and Lead.
Everybody of course, I mean that I don't remember who said it or the adage and I doubt if I correct me if I'm wrong but the your old habits will not open new doors and I've ever watched I watched you, obviously I've watched Alex and I watched the gyms in the culture of the gym launch culture, I've known them before, I've known them during.
5:55
And now here we are.
We see them after and they've been a tremendous amount that have Have hit home runs and continue to hit home, runs from a, from a personal standpoint.
Then, how have you dealt with maybe the many iterations that you've had to go through?
6:13
You know, I think I've always been somebody who's like I've always been growth oriented.
And so it first stemmed with like Fitness, when I was younger, I was like 14 to start going to the gym and learning how to lift by myself.
I didn't even like playing team sports.
I think I was more of a loner which is kind of ironic and I was really introverted and then it just continued to stem and I started reading and just doing my own thing, really early on and kind of like isolating myself from a lot of other people did.
6:40
Because I remember hearing like, if you do what everyone else does, Gonna end up like everyone else and I just didn't want to do that.
And so I think it just kind of stems into the like, you know, people like what would you do if you didn't do this?
And I was like, I would just be CEO of another company.
Like, I don't know, I think I'm built for this and so it just would have been me in a different company, found a different person to do it with be like, yeah.
7:04
Interesting.
Where now, It's I believe the last time we connected you guys were living.
Was it?
Were you in Florida?
Or were you, who else?
I don't even know where we worked.
We lived in so many places we were in California and then we moved to Albuquerque and then we moved to Puerto Rico.
7:27
And then we, and then we had to stay in Michigan for a few months and then move back to California.
And then now we're in Texas.
Wow, wow.
Now, is that From a planning standpoint, as the businesses have grown or evolve?
Are you overseeing different aspects of the business today?
7:44
Is that why you're moving around?
Or are you just kind of figuring out in the country where you might land?
No, I like being really honest.
So it's like taxes.
Like I'm about to sink out like at the business started blowing up and we were like, oh Texas, California suck.
I'm gonna just leave until we don't have to worry about that and we just left.
8:01
Right?
Well, we are.
We're a couple of days away from closing escrow on our property.
Heading out to Tennessee, which is a fantastic place for business owners.
I'm just saying, no, it's a great place.
I love Tennessee.
Beautiful.
Totally beautiful.
But the nice thing about this series is that we get it to be like a think tank amongst a bunch of owners and entrepreneurs business Builder, will talk to CEO side or the general manager side.
8:28
If you would have to think back in the earlier days of building your the infrastructure for your company, you had a lot of hard decisions to make you had a lot of maybe systems and processes to build.
But then also the human component said we had to hire all these people.
8:44
What were you looking for?
In those first hires where there any characteristics are personalities that stand out to you that you're like, man, this person is need to be on our team.
You know, in the beginning, who I look for is very different than who I look for now, but I wouldn't have done it differently.
8:59
And I have had a lot of those people without to be frank, but I just think that different people are fit for different stages of business.
And for someone to withstand A business growing, you have to be very adaptable.
So I did look for adaptability, but I think he'll look for scrappiness over that I look for hard workers that were Scrappy.
9:17
That could learn quickly.
I would say that that was probably the top things.
I looked for people that weren't afraid of change and we're hungry and some of that hasn't changed.
But as you continue to grow, you can't you always have to have that like gritty scrap on the inside but like, not everything that you put out, there can have that, that smell to it.
9:41
Absolutely, so in the day-to-day operations from the, you say, co-founder co-ceo Who are you personally responsible for like what's the size of what the business looks like today?
Yeah, we've got about 55 people in house.
9:59
Then we have about 30 outside contractors.
That's our development team.
And so if you look at that today, I'm over most of it aside from Alex is still pretty Hands-On with marketing.
And so, I think I have nine direct reports which would be most like our executive team.
10:19
Reports to me and then some of our strategic team reports to me.
So we have for executives and then we have nine strategic leaders, right.
And I still meet with those who report to Alex and marketing but you know, he's the marketing genius and so he meets their I'm or so help with like the management piece of that.
10:40
So I'm still I'm at an interesting flux point right now because we have Jim launch, which we've had for a long time, right?
And so I have people who have been in there for two and a half three years.
Ears who know how things run.
I've got to eat which is pretty much dependent upon Jim launch.
It doesn't need a ton of management and then I've got Alan which is a brand new function in which I'm a lot more Hands-On because I'm setting the foundation.
11:01
And so I manage a lot more of the leadership in terms of Jim launch and Prestige and I'm image more tactically in the Mountainside.
So it's interesting.
It's kind of like going backwards.
Yeah.
That's for sure.
Well, let's take it on that leadership piece.
11:17
I mean, if you've got a product obviously like Launch and you wanted to have legs and live on, you know, for years.
What are your like what would you say?
Would be your top three things?
You are the most proud of in developing Jim launch and then I'll ask later, maybe what are your three biggest struggles?
11:37
Let's start with the winds.
What are you most most proud of from developing the leadership roles in the people that you have groomed inside?
Jim watch?
I'm proud of I would say the leaders that are Are still here today.
Who I've grown.
I think that's the coolest thing is.
11:53
I think I have a really good relationship with those leaders inside of gym launch.
And I'm just, I'm really proud of watching them grow as people because I don't, I'm pretty critical of myself, but I think watching others grow and knowing that you are able to help facilitate that and then they're fulfilled and we don't were high performance team.
12:11
So it's not as easy to fulfill a high performers requirements, as it would be, somebody who just likes being complacent, know that they're fulfilled in this, Company and that they're happy and they want to be here every day and that they want to do better every day.
I think it's just that in itself is something that I'm proud of.
I'm proud of the improvements we've made as a team.
12:30
Like it's really interesting, right?
Because like I'm not proud of any, like, giant Monument of things.
I'm not proud of how much money we made.
I'm not proud of this.
I'm not proud.
I'm proud of a small things.
I'm proud of like, the small things that we do well, and we've continued to get better and better at over time.
And I think that that's really interesting, so that's really what fulfills me.
12:48
I don't get like super excited over like big Monumental things that we hit or like objectives as a company.
I could I think site over like the small work that's boring.
I guess interesting.
How about the relationships?
So obviously, there's got to be people that now, you've groomed, you've created, and you're probably like, almost as if that you've created from adolescence or childhood all the way up.
13:10
And now you're like, look at that.
Look at them.
I've this has been amazing.
It's fulfilling to see that.
Have you created some good friendships through the company?
Yes, I'm hesitant to use the word friendships.
I think it's a degree of friendship.
I think it's camaraderie because I always want to make sure.
13:29
So here's the reason that I think friendship is interesting is because you can be as close of friends with your teammates, as it doesn't prevent you from holding them accountable, as they were a complete stranger.
I see?
Oh, that's always thinking on the line I balance, which is I have, I definitely I get along super well with some people and almost to a point where I have to always remind myself like, It can never get in the way of me holding them accountable and hole in them that their performance standards, which is interesting.
13:57
It's kind of like it's the most social and loneliest job that you can have.
I believe it.
I could completely believe that in developing staff and grooming from in turn up to General Manager.
It's, you get close.
But you think to yourself, like, hey, we still have to have this professional relationship.
14:15
Yep.
Well, now, how about the flip side?
If you were to have to look back now, hindsight being 20/20, let's say three of your hardest learning lessons or three of your most.
You look back and you're like damn it that just that that's going to live with me for a little while.
14:32
Yeah I can tell you that it's easy.
Um so I would say one is always give the customer what they want.
Not what they need.
I think that we first there was like period of time, probably eight months, that we really steered away from acquisition like for gems and we really focused on retention and And our clients very small segment of them like that.
14:54
But I think what the problem was that me and Alex liked that.
And we were we were more interested in that because we were like, you're going to make way more money retaining people than just continuously turning people.
And for us, that was really fascinating, but it's really not for the customers.
It's not something that they want to hear about consistently, and it wasn't what made us in the first place.
15:14
What made us was being really good at acquisition, really good at making people more money and so, identifying what your customer needs?
Never steering away from me.
Now we always talk about that now.
We're like what do they want?
You know, even if we don't think it's right, if it's what they want us to do for them, then we need to remember that because at the end of the day that's the responsibility of the business is to take resources and create something that is larger than the sum of the parts right through desire of the customer, right?
15:41
And so doing that, that's number one.
Hey guys real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
16:04
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads its fo free in exchange for your email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller leads and so that you can not miss out on it because last time That for like eight straight weeks really fast so that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
16:22
Number two would be in terms of hiring.
I wanted a lot of painful lessons there, which is, you know, I just made some really I'm like, I don't know how we got where we are because I mean, some stupid decisions.
I think there were probably two people that I put in leadership positions.
That should have never been there and I always go by like trust first, right?
16:42
Like five higher, you going to trust you automatically.
If you if you do something to ruin that trust, then I'm going to start, you know, looking at it.
But I Ruled a little bit too much by trustee.
And not as much by tighter management, accountability in the very beginning.
And so, I had one person for example, who over hired by ridiculous amount for their department, and it's my fault.
17:03
And I had to go in and back to fire those people because it was, I mean, they were hired by like, five times as many people because they just every time someone said, I think we need help, they just hired someone and we are very profitable companies.
It's not like, we were super bottom line driven at that time in the sense of like we weren't super worried about it.
17:22
Is there also a virtual and we're just such a different company today?
I would just never ever do that so that was a mistake because that's messing with someone's livelihood.
It's not something I'm proud of, I'm not sorry about it because I got to meet ya.
17:38
You can't be you know and I think too many people are like so you know, they get so hung up on it and I'm like, dude like that's the risk.
You take as you get the biggest reward.
You also to live with the biggest failures that people will hate you for which is interesting, but I'm okay with it.
And then the third thing, if I'm thinking of mistakes in hindsight, I would say.
18:05
I don't know if there's mistakes.
I think something I've learned though, it's just that.
I think that what it takes to become a larger company and which I think it would have been helpful.
If I had learned sooner, is that you need to really be able to hone in on the balance of having leadership skills versus managerial skills and you need to understand what each of those is and what it means, what it looks like in an ideal world.
18:30
And I think in the beginning I would LED so much off of Just leadership.
I was a man called me like, an operational leader, right?
I didn't necessarily know how to do much, but I knew how to lead people in influence them too.
Things and build relationships.
And now, I really honed in in the last, you know, year or so.
18:48
And that's why I continue to hone in on.
It's like, how do I run a more effective meeting?
How do I balance these kpis, how I hit these performance metrics and dry track them?
How do I know we're being efficient?
What's our efficiency in this department?
You know what our apis and, and I think that you have to find the balance, those two, and what, what it takes to run a small organization, if you want to grow it, you have to develop more of that discipline, something fun, but it's something I wish if people realize how important, Nation and data is especially small business owners.
19:15
I think I asked about to crms now in the space.
Like, you know, what do you have this data?
And I like, yeah.
But that's actually the last thing people want and like, I think, the only reason I have a CRM is so I can have data, like, you talking about, well, the gym owners don't want that, and I was like, it's a joke, they're like, well, they'd rather have a spot to put in their work out.
19:32
So I'm like, what the fuck.
That's probably the, some of the exact same frustrations that the leadership at push press has, where the CRM is powerful to deliver.
Data.
But when you, you have that raw bit of information and you give it to the gym owner, then they look at it, they just go, you know, whatever and so I can imagine your frustrations absolutely.
19:55
Yeah, because I'm just like Dan protect ourselves from our emotions is information and data because it's just facts, right?
And so it's but I think a lot of times people are trying to protect their own emotions by avoiding it because it's maybe not what they want to see.
20:11
Of course, apply paint.
It's a picture that's either.
They listen to what they have to change and make a decision if they ignore it, they don't have to make that hard decision right?
With in that case you just default to the worst decision.
Well then let's kind of go down that road.
I mean you have seen tremendous growth.
20:27
You've learned magnificently how to Pivot multiple times over, but with growth with tremendous growth, obviously comes some professional collateral damage and that you have to think to yourself.
Flag.
20:44
That's I have to make this decision, it's the best for the company, it's the best for where we're going like in your mind, you know, your vision and your mission and kind of where you want to be along the way, how how have you quelled or maybe you can speak to this when it comes to like the competition mindset or the, you know, the dominance mindset, how do you let go of for lack of better?
21:07
Professional terms, how do you let go of those that that conflict with?
Or how do you let go of, you know, the Folks that are, you know, now looking down their nose thumbs down at your product or thumbs down at your company.
How do you disconnect from that?
Well, one, I don't see any of it.
21:25
Like, I'll see ya.
I get sent to me and people see it.
I show it.
And I just like, I just honestly, I laugh and most of it.
I'm like, I can't believe someone said that I'm like, did you know this?
I'm like, that's a new one.
Honestly, if you just wipe it off, you just let it go.
21:41
I don't respond to anybody who says anything bad about him.
Like, you know, him like I would never in my real life, nobody that I would ever be friends with their associated with myself, Whatever talk that way to me, or I would just never choose to interact with somebody who trolls on the Internet or likes to just emotionally vomit all over other people because they don't like their product or company.
22:03
And so I'm just like won both.
Those people are ever going to buy anything for me anyway.
So like I give a fuck what they think.
Right.
Second is, I'm I mean, like if you ever Grant Cardone he's like you ain't got a jet.
Yeah, I mean, like they got jet.
22:19
I'm like, I don't show of anything we have anything done but I'm like, dude, like, I don't know, results speak for themselves.
Like if you were right about things and maybe you would be further along in your life, instead of just like, okay like that.
I'm like, I feel bad.
You have a limited perspective and you just want to paint me into this picture, you know, evil, because I've accomplished something that makes you feel insecure.
22:39
That's truly how I view it.
And every I say that because every time I think any bad thought about somebody, I I think to myself, like why would I feel that way about somebody, right?
Yeah, and I think that people like to depict somebody as good or bad and they don't know how to see the in between.
22:55
And I start up really such a shame in a gray.
Yeah.
But for the most part, it says, I think I'm immune to it.
I think that's because I just really, I do not believe that anything that anyone says about, anybody else is about them.
I think it's about themselves, right?
23:11
It's worth.
I'm right.
Like anytime I get it.
If I am a Dalek for something, right?
For example.
Am I really met Alex for that or my mad at myself and I'm just projecting it onto him.
Now I am the time 99% of the time.
It's me.
And so you know, when I see that I'm just like you having a bad day like they do.
23:31
So I pissed you off, I make you feel insecure.
Did I make you feel less than?
Did I say something that questions your beliefs and therefore makes you worry about your tile worldview being incorrect?
You know, and I think right now people have a really hard time and you see it now right?
They don't know how to disagree with.
23:47
People without hating them, right?
It's not like I disagree.
We can still hang out.
It's I disagree.
You're wrong.
You're a horrible person.
Get out of my life.
Yeah.
It's it's so fascinating because anytime, someone disagrees with me, I'm like, really, like why do you think that like, tell I'm curious?
24:04
Why tell me?
And that's how I approach it and it's just kind of insane.
How many people like in the world now?
Like they don't they're like I hate you.
You go in the bad bucket.
We're never talking.
I nothing you say.
Is of any importance or is ever correct?
24:19
Because you said, one thing I disagree with.
Well, it's, yeah, it's crazy.
I just saved you.
It just shows the level of maturity that, you know, immediately.
Alright, that's not someone who we can consult with, hang out with, you know, have a conversation with.
It doesn't that just doesn't seem to work, right?
24:36
And then also say, I'm like, you know, because a lot of gym owners like, what these two are talking crap about me, right?
Like kids are just advertising for you.
Like nobody talk shit about that.
Jim down the street that isn't making any money, right?
They talk shit about the gym down the street.
24:51
That's making all the money.
You know, that's the consumers and consumers.
See everyone talking shit about somebody.
They're like, that must be the best person in the industry because everybody is throwing rocks at them.
Just like, it's like, you know what I mean?
I totally dig it.
Hey, from a rather than a collateral damage Direction.
25:08
Let's go in the opposite direction and then, let's talk about maybe a little bit of tech as a leader, and as someone has to consistently, Lee communicate and clearly and effectively, you know, continue to rally the troops.
What technology do you rely on?
25:26
Are there any systems?
Are there any apps are there any things that you're like?
Hey, without these three things?
I would be stuck in the mud.
I think one is, you know, you could call it, we use one that's specific to our CRM, it's called click, but it's basically slack.
25:44
Okay, before that, we used a boxer.
And so just a quick back and forth like day to day, chatting tool.
Okay.
I mean, zoom zoom is where we post all our meetings since day one and honestly notes in my phone.
26:02
So what I do is like to manage things, like I have every meeting that I have Every week and then I have everyone on one that I every week and then all the things that were discussed and I just go look back at my notes every week and review those.
And I keep myself organized with little folders.
Yeah.
In my phone it sinks my computer.
I can just write in my computer, it's free.
26:21
I totally dig it, I love it.
I love it.
It's some folks will, you know, they're constantly emailing in, or they're texting in or they're, you know, same thing, they're on Facebook or Instagram.
They're like, I need more things.
I need more efficiencies, I need more, you know, whatever.
So folks are always asking, People that have like 50 million dollar businesses and they're running off, Google Sheets, you can program those.
26:40
While I'm up there, like software, meaning, that it makes sense.
It totally makes sense without divulging too much.
Maybe that could be construed.
As may be secretive down the road.
Can you speak to where you guys are looking to take this post covid?
26:56
I mean, obviously, there's growth potential and where you guys?
See yourself heading.
Yeah, you know, we're going to continue to basically You know, I think it's about a year ago that we started encouraging our gyms to have remote and in-person model, and it's difficult for people to pull off easy.
27:15
In theory, you don't have a strong team, it's really hard to organize both and so we've moved towards everything.
We support in terms of sales, marketing fulfillment is all geared towards, you can be remote, you can be in person or you could be both and we have a solution for each of those in terms of what we release deliver and promote in our Company.
27:36
So that's the first thing.
The second is like the software that we have that basically Works leads for Jim's.
It works remote leads and in person leads now and then you know with our supplement line just working on some of the ux to make it easier for remote purchases that we've been doing and then releasing more products continuously that are at a little bit of a lower price point to help with people that maybe loss of jobs, Etc.
28:02
Right, you know, those are things that we're doing.
It hasn't steered off like our plan.
Super far.
I'm it was like a year ago where we were like a Industries already going in this direction.
It's just like we took 20 30 and then brought it to 2020.
28:19
I just celebrated but you know, we're pretty well equipped to manage it as a company which is, I think just from the culture.
So you're saying if there are coaches out there that are listening today to today and maybe Were they?
28:37
They were let go from their gym and they're looking as like, I could be a remote coach today.
I could, I could do this from home, I could do it from my laptop, and they're so, you're providing a solution for remote only versus the old school brick-and-mortar, Jim's right?
28:53
Yeah.
And a lot of our gyms have, you know, Unfortunately they just had to go 100% remote and so that's actually probably what most people are doing right now in our group.
And I would say that's probably also why why more people in our group or doing well in other groups?
Just.
29:10
Yeah.
And I think Alex are like high performance driven and we're really pushed change.
And so, you know, people come in our program either they're like eaten up alive or they Thrive and they become a champion.
And so I think it's really it's because it's interesting in the last few months because people have forced themselves to become Champions because of the situation, right?
29:29
You really got to see what people are made of, which has been really cool to watch.
Well, that segues perfectly into the last piece.
I mean, this platform provides an opportunity for both the gym owners.
The general managers, the coaches, the interns, and even those individuals who are brand-new looking into the gym space or the coaching space.
29:47
If you could use this platform to speak to those who might be on the fence, they might be fearful, they might have just lost their job.
Their gym is just surviving or maybe they're only one more month out.
Maybe they're here in California and who knows when they're going to open up?
30:03
Any messages to them.
Any, any poignant pieces of clarity or any, you know, Pearls of Wisdom that you'd love to share with those folks to maybe get them past this next couple of days.
Yeah, I have a three things that come to mind.
The first is Right.
30:21
Now, what's become very obvious is that the only difference between someone who's going to win in the short term or lose in.
The short term is how they React to what is happening now.
So I have people that have had all cards put against them you know they shut down for the foreseeable future.
They still paying rent.
30:37
They have a lot of employees and they are killing it.
And then I have people who are in a situation where they're shut down for six weeks, people come back quickly and yet they still let their gym go down and completely closed it.
And I say that because it we just all get to choose our attitude in any situation.
30:57
And so we get to choose if we want to win or lose and I think it's really interesting to most people look at winners and thank you didn't have as many obstacles as me the way to think about it.
Is you have the same obstacles as me.
You handled them differently differently.
Yeah.
And so I'd say that's the first You have always have control over the outcome, especially even in these days.
31:14
If you believe that you can overcome the situation, I 100% have.
I'm seeing it happen right now.
We have tons of people that are making more money now than they were before, just because we told them it's possible and it is possible.
The math doesn't lie, the second piece going to that is like nothing is permanent right?
31:32
And so even if you are in a shitty situation right now you don't have to be tomorrow or next week or next month or in six months, you know?
Maybe it's me, six months, maybe a year.
I think it's just really everything.
Always feels so permanent when we're through it.
Yeah, I guess somebody's tired.
31:48
One day that man, I'm always tired.
Are they one bad day at work?
That man hates job.
It's like the day before they had a great day.
And so I think it's really.
You have to look back and look at the track record to remember that, it's always going to go up and down.
It's never I seen constant.
And then the last piece one with that is what, you know, I just always think about this, which is like unless you have no friends, you'll never be homeless.
32:10
And so Like what I think of people like.
I mean for me I'm always like, let's go worst-case scenario, right?
And when we announce for start the business we slept at our friends house for four months.
Guess what?
Wasn't that bad?
They had great food.
They cooked, they love having us there.
Like, we had people to talk to and so we always joke.
32:26
It's like, do you know if your friends and you've got family, you're never gonna be homeless, like what's the worst case scenario?
Like what are you?
So afraid of.
And so I think just asking yourself that and painting that picture and confronting it saying, how bad is that really right?
That's it's obviously just those three things just to think about and kind of just chew on over the next few weeks.
32:48
I think would be important and useful.
And then the last one is just, I think right now it's the time we need people to be leaders in the community like people need people to rely on.
They need people that are a light that aren't just talking negatively being up like having a down Nina.
33:04
Yeah yeah, yeah.
I think it's just I look at it and I'm like, I sign It up for owning a business.
Therefore, I have the responsibility to be a light to other people right now.
So I think I've been more positive and upbeat than I've been at any other time.
It's because I don't I want people to be able to rely on me and so I would just remind everyone that if they chose this life and that's just part of what comes with it and it doesn't take much more than a few minutes in the morning to get yourself, right to remember.
33:30
Like you can completely change the day of everyone who works for you and all of your clients if you just show up.
Yep, I totally agree.
I love it.
I bet probably most powerful.
For folks to figure out their future is to start, of course with themselves.
I love it.
33:46
It's so for those folks that have watched today and they were inspired by maybe something they picked up, maybe they jotted down some notes themselves and they're interested in following up with you.
Where can they find you?
Or how can they find you and getting contact?
Yeah, I think my Instagram, I'm so not popular on social media is the Layla and hormones e and and find me on Facebook, Layla or Mosey.
34:10
Okay, that's it.
I don't have any I don't like me links or podcasts or anything like that.
I just, I'm pretty internal love it.
The super, it's super slick and easy.
Well I sincerely appreciate your time, the wisdom, the growth of look back.
We say the Lessons Learned for some folks.
34:26
We've been interviewing, we tell them look, hey in about two or three months, when this covid stuff shuts down or people start returning back to operations, we'd love to come back and revisit and all that look back on like hey, what did we learn?
How are we better now?
I did, what do we change to?
34:41
I mean, we know so many folks are getting ready to change.
So we'll definitely again as we go forward.
So thank you.
I sincerely for myself personally to you please tell Alex.
Hello.
This has been fantastic.
I will and thanks for having me on.
Eric will you got it?
34:57
All right.








0:00
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out, if that's what you are into.
0:16
And if not keep enjoying the show, what we're trying to figure out is, how much can we make up front in the first 30 days and then what's the lifetime value of the customer?
Welcome, to the gym Secrets podcast, we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer.
ER, and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
0:33
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on everybody?
Hope you are having a phenomenal Saturday.
I've been very, very bad about been very bad about my content lately and that is because I've been doing daily coaching with our community and so a lot of my creative output has been going there.
0:54
But I wanted to talk to you about a cash flow process that I've been consistently walking through for the last couple months part of this started with the book that I'm still currently working on.
Called building a better mousetrap.
And all of that is around how you can increase, how much money you make per customer.
1:13
That comes into your business.
And so the easiest way to know if you have an issue is thinking about the single question.
So I'm dealing with a lot of agencies on our software side and what I'm essentially walking them through is a cash flow quadrant but not the same cash flow quadrant that you'd have in like Robert kiyosaki's Rich Dad, Poor Dad, but a cash flow quadrant for how you can increase the value per customer because fundamentally It's my viewpoint that if a business cannot pay $100 or $200 to get someone in the door, they don't have a marketing problem.
1:45
They have a business problem, right?
They've a cash flow issue and they don't know how to acquire customers and make cash flow from.
And so, what I'll do is, I want to walk you through the four step process that I look at when I'm looking at a customer, that's coming in the door and that doesn't matter what they're coming in on, they could come in on a low, a free offer that come in on a low barrier, offer like a new client special or something like that.
2:05
That's a 29.
Are things we do is really matter or it could be a straight-up value offer where there's no discount whatsoever.
There's no, no free, no nothing simply value being provided.
So there's are fundamentally the three types of offers that exist in the marketplace, free discount and value, right?
But all of them can still lead to the same mousetrap, right?
2:23
And so the first thing that I'll look at is products, right?
Is there something that we can add on in this sales choreography when someone comes in the door?
So we can immediately add a product purchase to bowl.
It on two additional to an initial service package, right?
2:39
So inertial service package could be X period of time x number of sessions or a single session done at a discount or even a single session free, like an evaluation or or whatever, right?
The point is, is in this works in any industry, right?
You could come in and obviously in the gym and fitness face, the next natural step for products will be supplements, right?
2:56
If you were in a chiropractor's Clinic.
The next natural sale might be Orthotics or a special pillow, or some sort of brace or whatever, right.
It's Physical products we can immediately purchase from you at a very high margin, specifically to go with the service that you're also selling them.
3:13
Another example might be if you're in the beauty space, you might sell masks, or serums, or creams.
All of those things would be the first quadrant of how you can increase how much you make per customer, right?
So let's say I'm going to use a hundred dollars with the average.
Like if you can't pay $100 for every person who walks in the door and your marketing, then you're not going to have a business where you can make, you can make a hundred dollars on a customers coming.
3:36
In and service-based business, you're not going to succeed in has nothing to do with your Market is because you don't have this process down.
So even if they come in for free boom you saw a hundred two hundred dollars per person in product.
All right, you've already broken even on that but if you still want to really beat and dominate everyone in the market, you go to the second quadrant which is how can I get them to add on additional Services, right?
3:56
So this might be introducing them to up cells within your core offer.
So if you were facility the gym, facility, for example, you might have your large group training but Might also have accountability nutrition coaching, semi-private, training, all of those things would be add-ons to the initial core offer all of this increase, the average lifetime value and investment of the new custom that's coming in, which allows you to make more money.
4:20
All right?
That's in a gym space.
If you were looking at a Med Spot, someone comes in for a Botox, you know, treatment or whatever.
First thing you're going to do is try and get them to buy a package.
That's more of the same thing, but then also give them what I would consider a menu close which is Is let me show you what other things we have to offer.
4:40
We have CoolSculpting, we have filler, we have microdermabrasion, we have skin tightening, we have whatever, right?
All of those things would be showing them what other services and offerings.
You have for that exact customer so that they can, so that they can become more value in that you can become more valuable to them.
4:55
Right?
So Cashflow quadrant number one is product cash flow.
Quadrant number two is add-on Services.
Number three is more from for somebody who's more Constraining what's to make more money per customer up front.
You can add on prepaid or financing.
5:12
And so if you can, if you're in a really established industry, you can get financing companies to do this.
For you Care.
Credit is massive in the healthcare industry.
People get you know, get boob jobs financing and anything financed through CareCredit, right?
If you can establish that your business, you can get sometimes half or more to finance the packages that they may have purchased from you.
5:31
So, the third piece there is just simply asking and offering a 10% discount, To get some of the prepay and there's a keynote there.
You don't say paid in full you some offer someone to prepay that's the language around that to drag some of that Revenue upfront or sort of cash up front so that you can further liquidate the cost of acquisition.
5:50
Now let me, let me show you how powerful this is with a single math example.
If you have 10 people who walk in your door and let's say you sell five of them, all right and one of those five does a prepay on your service, right?
And let's say everybody else averaged out to 500 Hours for therefore the initial purchase but one of them paid 2,500 dollars, right?
6:13
That one.
Twenty five hundred dollar seal increases.
The average ticket from 500 to 1,000 across all of the customers that you had in the door.
So even if a small percentage, take that offer and can be a massive increase in the average order value average cart value, average cash per show, whatever way you want to call it.
6:29
And can change the game in terms of how you can acquire customers and beat out the people in your competitive space.
All right, so I want For I've said three so far.
So product is number one add-on Services number to getting people to prepay for services that are happening in the future.
6:44
Number three.
And then number four is continuity.
So is there a way that we can also tie continuity into this acquisition process, right?
So I'm going to, I'm going to not do the gyms because everything I do is about Jim's.
So I'm going to try and apply this in a different setting.
7:00
So let's say we have, I mean a med, Spas an easy one to use there's program.
So someone comes in for a discount boat.
Sprite.
First thing there, they might not make that the surgeon or that Med Spa Center, might not make a lot of money that first transaction, they might make a couple hundred dollars, but that should at least cover the cost per show.
7:16
The next thing they're going to do is give them a products.
Write the products that are going to go with that might be the serums, the max at home, because everything that someone's coming in for their wants to look younger and more beautiful.
Right?
And so, all all the products that would go along with that, would immediately be sold from like a take-home kit standpoint, like if you want to maintain these results or extend these Sighs.
7:36
You should have these things.
The next would be our menu close right.
Do you want to do, microdermabrasion you want to do the CoolSculpting, you want to do filler, whatever.
Right then we're going to prescribe a package that's going to be there.
Total Beauty package, which might take six months or whatever to get them to where we were, they want to be.
7:54
And then the continuity that we're going to tie into.
This is a process that I like to call down selling the upsell, alright?
And so with that is typically, you want to have people pay more in the beginning because it costs more to acquire customers across.
Order on board a customer that does to maintain a customer.
And so if we're getting more cash up front for these customers, they're going to be more invest in our process.
8:14
And it also allows us to cover the overhead of getting them, activated getting them on board and giving them a great experience.
But then, you can simply offer them the same thing that they've been getting.
But just on a recurring basis and do it at a pretty decent discount, and most people will jump at that offer.
8:30
What it does is then locks that person into regular recurring, cash flow for the business and then massively extends the lifetime value.
The customer.
A Mosin Asian quick break.
Just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright, so send me a connection request a note.
8:46
Let me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
And so I'm going to walk you through one single math example that I'll sign off but hopefully you can look at that quadrant within your existing sales process and say how can I Implement each of these four things into the sales choreography in my business, so that I can outspend my competition.
9:14
So that I can spend five hundred dollars per person walks in the door, a thousand dollars per person, walks in the door.
And the reason that's so important is because if you can get that cash per show hyena of then you can spend on multiple different channels of acquisition.
You can have referral.
Partners you can have, you can have coal traffic, you can have Affiliates, you can have all of these different venues you can have, you can have direct mail.
9:37
You can have Social Media stuff.
You can like all of these different venues cost different amounts but at a certain point, all of them become affordable and that is what unlocks the huge amounts of growth that are available for a business owner and it comes from the back, not the front.
And so everyone thinks they have a marketing problem, but typically, it's because they have a monetization issue, they're not good at cash flow, your choreography, the, the money that they're making per customer, Mer.
10:00
All right, so to bring this all home, what we're trying to figure out is, how much can we make up front in the first 30 days and then what's the lifetime value of the customer?
The cash value for the first 30 to 60 days is going to be important for how you spend money to get them in the door.
10:16
The lifetime value on the back end, is going to be how much money you're going to be able to extrapolate and how much revenue you make per month, based on your sales volume.
So, for example, if you sell 20 people every single month, and you know, that your lifetime value per customer is Thousand dollars total and you sell 20, customers per month total that.
10:34
It means that your business should cap out at 20 times 2000, which would be forty thousand dollars a month and that's an easy way to back into.
Like if you feel like your business has not been able to grow its because one of two, two numbers either you're not, you're not capturing enough on the back end or you don't have a big enough inflow.
10:50
That is it, it's all there is to it.
You can massively simplify this.
Now if we're looking at trying to back into that number so let's take a bit.
Gonna say that can only pay $100 per show which means they're not making a lot of money.
And then option b is, we've got a business incubator thousand dollars to show.
11:06
Let's see if we can reverse engineer a thousand dollars per show into a business model.
So if someone comes in and let's make it an attractive for an offer, let's make it a, let's make it a $19 new client special, whatever?
Right?
Evaluation, it doesn't really matter what industry it is.
11:23
It works the same way.
All right, so someone comes in for a $19 thing.
They show up.
All right from there.
Let's say that we know that we're going to close half on to the next service package.
Right now that next service package, let's say the average is going to be two thousand dollars, all right?
11:40
Now that's going to be over an extended period of time.
Cool.
Let's say that our minimum that we can get down is $500 because that's what we say is minimum in order to buy and that's why we're closing half and not 100%, right?
The next thing we do is we sell $200 per customer.
Now if two thousand dollars with the packages and we closed half word, a thousand dollars in lifetime value, all right?
11:59
Just one That first transaction half times 3,000 is 1,000.
All right.
Now of all the people that say, yes.
Now let's say we sell each of those people $200 for the product.
All right.
Now we had a two hundred dollars now, we're at $1200 lifetime value.
Then let's say, two out of those five people that we, you know, that we sold for example, decide to add on an additional thousand dollars worth of services.
12:24
All right?
From your other service offerings that you have.
All right?
So now we've got Fifths times 1000, which would be $400 that we add again to the customer.
So now we're at sixteen hundred dollars per show, all right.
12:41
And then again, on the back of that we say, hey, we know that from every of the five that we have we can get, let's say another two to sign on as a continuity at $200 a month.
And we turn out at 10%, Which tax another 2,000 dollars on 22 of those customers are Right.
13:00
And so that would add yet another.
Eight hundred dollars on top so you get twenty four hundred dollars per person that walked in the door for a free offer.
All right?
That is how you can.
Beat everyone in your Marketplace is that you consistently execute the process, right?
13:19
That means every single time you have a choreographed handoff between service, a, or service, one, and cell number two, so number two, and so number three, so number three.
And so number four, and if part of you is like, man, I feel like, I'd be selling all the time.
Yes.
Is the answer?
But but the secondary correlate to that is that if you look at the research that exists on how to maintain a customer over the Long Haul, it's about expansion Revenue, it's about Ascension.
13:47
It's about selling them more things over time so that they can continue to be reminded of the value that you provide because over time people always want new things.
And so it is your duty.
If you believe in the value that you provide to make the offers to those people and communicate that Process in a seamless way.
14:05
So that every part of your business knows, my objective is basing, the pathan from point B to point C from point C to point D and all of that choreograph process, ultimately results in a front-end that allows you to spend whatever you want per customer.
14:21
Because you're back in is so strong.
And that process that Cashflow quadrant is the reason that Jim launch has been able to stay number one in this industry, despite the saturation, despite the charlatan is, despite the many People who would claim that they're doing the same thing but they're not because they don't execute that process.
14:40
And at the end of the day, what you are always going to be paid for?
Is the value that you can create the marketplace, we've been able to choreograph that process for the businesses that we serve.
So that they make more per customer and so that their customers are better served.
And that's ultimately what you have to do.
What we have to do is entrepreneurs and business.
14:55
Owners is, how can I serve my customer in the highest and best agree ever?
And how can I do it in a seamless away as possible?
So that I can have as little operational drag as table so that I can out, mark it my competition and continue to play the game.
So anyways, that cash flow quadrant is is how I think through the choreography around creating selling systems so that our gyms and our businesses can beat out their competition and I would encourage you to print that out, put it, put it somewhere.
15:27
So you can think about every single sales process that you have through that lens and I guarantee you that you'll make more money, that's what That's what when I do my Consulting days and I sell Consulting hours, this is the process that I walk.
Those business owners through and nine times out of ten, we can almost double or triple.
15:44
The amount that they make per customer simply following that process.
So hope that was about before you give it an amazing Saturday execute that make more money serve at a higher level and crush it.
Lots of love.
Could you soon back?








0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually a pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
Welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Hey, what's going on everybody?
Happy Wednesday.
0:32
I'll make this a short one for you.
I just got off a call with a company that I have a vested interest in.
And so we were talking about how to set up the management metrics in place for the business as we're trying to scale it.
And so, one of one of the things I picked up from Andy Grove in shoot, what is called high output management, I think is paired metrics and it was it was just a great epiphany.
1:00
Me and so I'm going to share it with you so the way the any growth, who's the founder of Intel very smart dude.
Manages each of the roles within the company is that he tries to put paired metrics in place.
So it's not just number of sales or just closing percentage or just insert one thing here, right most times.
1:18
And this is just myself included.
I would usually should be like, this is the one key metric that I want to look at, right?
This the one thing that matters for this position, but you think a little bit more about it, it tends to be to that.
Are in parallel.
All right.
And so what it does is help, you helps you manage the balance or the dichotomy between the performance and roll and typically, it'll be between speed or output in terms of total volume and quality, all right?
1:44
And so, the way that you balance this with, in any position would be, for example, if you're talking to a salesperson, it would be total number of sales against refunds backups.
All right, if you're looking at a customer service position, it might be speed of ticket.
2:00
Or total number of tickets handled and customer satisfaction or MPS course are like promoter score, right?
So, that would be a balance between two different metrics that you're that, you're looking at and then that way.
Because at the end of the day you never really want to.
2:16
Because a lot of times in business, it's not about either extreme.
It's about managing a dichotomy of being my being micromanaging or my delegating too much, right?
Like is either of them wrong.
No.
You want to follow kind of right in that middle path and in different At times, you might lean towards one area or the other area more, but when you're looking at each component of the business you can look at balance metrics.
2:39
And so, I'll break down more examples to think might be useful for you.
So if you're looking at a marketing position, it's going to be told on Merv applications against qualified applications, right?
So it's like, okay, this is the total volume, I got.
But how many will qualify, right?
The next would be the sales guy, which I just went over, like total sales, volume or closing percentage against Knockouts.
3:00
All right.
The service position told a number of responses and or tickets handled or customer complaints are resolved or speed of resolution against the quality score right on the back end.
Let's say I'm trying to think of other positions that you can have for this.
3:19
I mean, like, right out of obviously, I'm linking them life, but if you think about every piece of your business right now, all of the people that report to you, there's typically A metric that you're trying to push but something you're trying to also, conversely not have happen.
3:35
And so if you can Define both of those things for the person, then you can push as hard as you can on the top, the top side, right?
The speed, or the volumetric and balance it.
So another example is, if you're in a physical product business, it would be inventory against shortages, right?
3:51
You don't want to have tons and tons of inventory because that's not good.
You have lots of cash sitting there.
It's not good for the business.
It's dangerous for the business but if you just say it, I want you to just keep our inventories as low as possible, right?
Then you're going to start having shortages, right?
And so you want to balance inventory against shortages and then that's the metric that you're reporting on for that position, right?
4:12
So for me, that would be my finest Department who's managing that component of our business in the supplement side, right?
Taxes versus audits right?
Or I you know any kind of issue that you have the IRS and so with each of these things that have you have the positive thing, what you're going for against the negative thing, you're trying to Avoid.
4:30
And so I want to call this a sweet spot, which clearly I didn't.
And I'll name it later, but that's the managing, the dichotomy in management using parallel.
Metrics, will get you so much closer to the Sweet Spot of optimum performance for each of these roles.
And also going through the mental exercise for yourself will help you to find those things for each of the roles in your business.
4:51
And ultimately the only thing that's going to allow you to scale the business.
If you're in the service space, which many of the people are listening as our is initially, We it's going to be your ability to train people and onboard people, right?
So it's in your culture in your training or training gets them up and going culture, keeps them going right?
5:10
Most of these are real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to fifteen hundred dollars.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
5:30
And then the keeping them going is, making sure that you're monitoring the right things for them so they can get the outcome that you really want.
Right?
And so I just had this call with the founder of that business that I'm now invested in.
And we were talking about how we're setting that business up to scale, so that each of the roles that we have get balanced out.
5:51
And so, for their, we have image editors.
So we can see the total number of images, they're edited to photography based business against the number of call.
Axe or Corrections that need to happen and so you can see this in virtually every position that exists within your business.
But if you simply look at that name them and explain it to the person, then they'll understand everything that you want and then you alternately make more money and then they will feel like they have more clarity and if they don't understand how to do those things, then you train, right?
6:19
And that's the entire, that's the whole game.
Is you train them.
You give them the two metrics, you walk the middle and then that is how you maintain high level performance over an organization.
So Shout out to Andy Grove for being smarter than me hopefully that was useful for you for me that was a huge takeaway when I was going through his book and so use it make more money, have higher profits, have have your team have happy Wednesday lots of love it.
6:44
You soon bye.








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else when people have a cost.
Of goods when they were like, you know, in the it's sewing smoothies or they're selling products, right?
They usually tend to be more aware of their margins in service.
We just exist as though.
Time is free, right?
0:41
Our time our employees time is all free.
Welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Good morning, everyone, happy Saturday.
0:58
Let me see if I can get some light.
Here, for those of you were watching, there you go.
I sun in my eyes, that'll be sweet.
Anyways, margin Madness is one of the things that I want to talk about today was something that came up last night.
While I was thinking I was talking to one of our partners on the Allen agency side, and this is a mistake that gym owners make that HD lens.
1:20
Make the anybody, you know what I mean?
Anyone who's in business makes, especially when you're starting out and I made it to.
It's also your story.
Just to illustrate the example and Couple of principles you can take away from it.
So when I was 15, 16 17 I was a blender tenor.
1:36
Was my first or second job?
When I, when I, when I, you know, in high school and we would make smoothies and all that kind of stuff, right?
It was at Smoothie King and the owner, steam is David Lynch, nice guy.
One day under staff, one of our stores.
1:53
And so I was working at the store and so is the manager at the time Chris, I was new and this huge like like two buses full of like teachers or students that camera was, it was a horde that walked in the door and after they had all made their order he said, hey you know everybody like just because you guys such big group which is going to give you guys you know 20% off just for just to say thank you for all the business and whatever and and you know we made all the smoothies and then you know the rest of the day was normal and then Dave came by that night and Saw the huge order and then solve the discount because you go through the sheets and he was like, what's this?
2:36
What's like, what is, what is this?
20% discount?
What happened, where they bring a coupon for everybody?
Like what happened here and he was like, no?
I mean, it was a, it was a big, big group.
I figured I would just, you know, give them a, you know, reward for bringing so much business.
And he was like, you just gave away our margin.
2:53
He's like, that's all I was trying to make on these on these drinks.
He's like we don't make, you know, 100%.
Of the money that we bring in right is like this business runs on 15 percent margins, he's like, can you just gave the whole margin away?
That's it.
3:09
So all of that work that we did, we didn't make anything from.
And I remember thinking about that and be like, it was the first time I was 15.
I mean, I'm super, you know, I was young I wasn't like, you know, some people like I was making lemonade stands and I was 10 like I wasn't that way.
I was like you know, in school and stuff but I remember thinking I was like, huh?
3:25
Revenue isn't profit you know like you know just like an interesting moment but which one?
Wild to me is that despite that especially in the services space, all right?
Because when people have a cost of goods when they were like you know in the selling smoothies or they're selling products, right?
3:41
They usually tend to be more aware of their margins in service.
We just exist as though.
Time is free, right?
Our time our employees time is all free, especially when you have grouped together services, like Fitness, or I mean, really any most Services, you have clumped up work.
4:00
And so I was talking to a chance on our last night and he was saying, yeah, I've been, you know, bringing these people on and he was discounting what he should have been charging, right?
And my first, my first, like biggest asked you right now is stop.
4:16
Like, it is a, it is a, it's such an easy sign of a newer green business owner that you negotiate with terrorists, right?
If someone comes in and says, why can't afford that.
They can they just don't think it's valuable enough.
4:31
And so you need to work on the skill of selling.
You don't get need to change your price.
Your price is non-negotiable.
Your price has been predetermined based on what you want to make per product X Y Z, right?
If you know that your, you know, your margin is 20%, when you're, you know, charging a hundred dollars a month for something, whatever it is, right.
4:53
If you want to double that, then you all you have to do is get to $120, right?
Go from 100. 220 and you have to always operate in that mindset.
One of the biggest traps that you can do is operate in.
They fixed costs mindset, which is like, well, I'm already covering all this stuff.
5:09
All of this extra money that comes in is going to just be on top.
It doesn't work that way, right?
It might work the way in your head, but if you can keep the discipline of every one of these hundred dollar-a-month customers that are bringing in right now or thousand dollar month you can you can add zeros.
It doesn't matter.
5:24
Right?
Customers that are coming in right now.
I know that I'm only making x on it.
Right.
You know what your margin is at the end of the month?
It's 15%.
Then multiply the top line by 15%, and then all of a sudden, you'll be far more protective of your price point, right?
5:40
And we far more protective of your margin and so the like my biggest asks, you is that when you're, when you're looking at your pricing and someone does have some sort of, you know, pushed back to you.
Like, you should be able to push right back and be like, you think we make 100 margin here, like I have cost of doing business here, right?
5:59
Right?
And like, that's that's how this works.
This is the price that we already have.
Now, if we can try and figure out, again, figure out a payment plan, if you want to do that.
Now again, with payment plans, you should bake in the fact that you were taking on risk, right?
If someone saying, you know, your thing is $400, I'll pay you 200 twice if you want.
6:18
And, you know, the second payment you have a certain amount of risk.
That's not going to happen.
Then it should be two payments of 250, right?
Like, you should bake in the fact that you're not going to collect, all that money up front, which means your You are taking on risk as a business owner, right?
Obviously raise your hand if you've ever had or not up and down, if you're listening, if you've ever had someone, who said they would do a payment plan with you and not finished their commitment, right?
6:41
Obviously.
And those are cost of doing business, but part of the cost of your business is knowing those costs so that you can account for them, right.
And so I mean gosh, I had so many stories about this but big picture here.
One never negotiate with terrorists to.
6:59
Always know and think about your margin when you're talking about price with a customer, if you're at a hundred dollars and you know, you make 15%, then 15 bucks is all you've got right?
And it's the like hey can I just get you know, 15% off on this and you're like?
So do you want to run a non-profit?
Do you want to run a just want to do work for free?
7:16
Because the end of the day you could have just not done it and made zero dollars to write, like, just think about it.
Like you could just keep on living your life and not do the work and also have the same amount of profit at the end of the day.
And so like, you have to protect Your margin.
You have to protect your profit when you're looking at your pricing.
7:34
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
7:50
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I catch the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
And so the corollary to that of the flip side of that is that if you know what your margin is right now, this is one of the number one.
8:11
Things I do in any business myself, included that I constantly reassess and I think it's one of the things that we do very well is that we look at what our margin is.
And then we say, okay now we're running at X percent.
Let's say it's 30.
Well, like what could we do to get this Top Line Up by another 10% 10% in aggregate.
8:33
So, Like 3249, you know, you know what I'm saying here?
So, 25% increase going from 10, so from 30% margin, just adding an extra 10% on top of the price.
What could I do that?
Does not require me to take on more overhead.
8:50
What could I do?
Number one?
Think it's just learned how to sell better, right?
Number to provide a payment plan, that actually covers your lost that happened on the back end, right?
Three.
You can add a fee or an activation or an enrollment, like all of these.
These things are things that you can tack into your business to boost margin, right?
9:08
If you look at and that I'd highly encourage you to study some of the super established businesses out there.
Go to go to Budget rental car, right?
See how many fees and enrollments and things like that, that they've done.
You can get upset about it or you can study it as a business owner and think like, that's pretty slick.
9:24
I wonder if there's some something like that I can apply in my business, right?
You know, the same degree.
Look at.
Look at telephone companies, right?
How many different things to do, okay?
So they charge This that you'll find anything for this.
They have these add-ons, they have these s separate accounts that like all these different things that they bolt on because they know what their fixed costs are.
9:43
And then they just start bolting on top.
And so, the reason that I think small business owners, many times do not make money and work all the time is because they do not protect their margin and they think, well, it's just me doing ex extra, right?
No, you make 20%.
9:59
That's your, take home, or whatever it is, right?
That is all that exists for Are you in this deal?
Make sure you protect it, and never to negotiate with terrorists.
So there was a study done by I think is Wi-Fi and they were looking at the, the gyms that were the best and had the highest prices and highest margins and Pious growth.
10:21
And the ones that had that did not have any price discounts everyone pay the same price.
There was no backdoor deals and I can tell you whenever I look at, you know, a new business that's coming in, it's always like, oh yeah, well we've got these guys.
This price and oh yeah, I've got a special deal for that guy.
10:36
Oh, yeah, I know his mom.
Like, they're telling me they're trying to, they're telling me all the reasons that they have discounted.
And every time we get on the phone, when I was doing sales back in the day and I've had, okay, give me your numbers, but your prices, and they would say, oh, you know, we're 189 a month and I'm like, oh, that's great.
That's awesome.
So, how many customers you have their, like, I've got, you know, 150, I'm like, oh, that's great.
10:55
I'll say 100 from a say, she got 100 customers.
Awesome.
So you're doing 18,900 a month and they're like, no, I'm we're probably closer to like a 10 or 11.
No.
Like okay, then how is your price 189?
Like, oh well, that's you know, that's, that's what it's, you know.
11:10
That's that's what it is.
Now wasn't always like that and you know, this guy, you know, I've got the first to know, 80 or at $60 a month.
It sounds like you have like, 10 people at 189, and the rest of your business is at 100 on average like yeah more or less, right?
11:25
And so if you want to make the money you have to be you have to want it more than the person that is trying to take it from you by negotiate away.
All right, on the flip side, this is the the evil side of me that comes out.
If you're dealing with a small business owner, you can always negotiate the price because they do not protect their margins.
11:47
And so I'll give you one trick that I learned from an old Mentor of mine that you can use and take to the bank.
All right, if you have any type of work that is ever supposed to happen at your business, you've got Carpenters, you've got cleaners, you got whatever right if for some respects me with Um stuff.
12:05
If for some reason they miss something they messed something up right corner gets nicked.
So you know, door hint is a little bit off its hinge or it's a little, you know, a little bit crooked or something, minor right?
You find that thing.
And right when they're done he would say hey that looks a little bit off and they're like, you know, I mean it's about us you know, suppose we can just like well what would it cost to, you know, redo that and make it right?
12:33
And at that point they're done.
Work, right?
And so they're going to be like oh it's I mean this is going to be that.
We'd have to redo the whole thing.
We have to Dismount, they come up with a whole bunch of terms and you're like got it.
So it would cost us at least, you know, at least 500 bucks.
You know, in time and labor just to just to fix that, right?
12:49
Like, huh, well, that sounds like a good place to start for a discount.
And I saw him use that move so many times with people and they just like, would eat their own words because they're talking.
They're trying to inflate how much it's going to cost them to make this fix.
And he's like, well, I've got Live with it.
13:04
That sounds like a good place to start for a discount and he would get it almost every time.
And so all that to say you can also ask for additional things.
So, if you say okay, well I'll do that.
Well, what else can you get me?
I'll pay that price but I need, I need a little bit, little something extra sweeten, this deal, right?
13:22
And a lot of small business owners were all for you to do more for the same price.
And so I say all this to say, be strong, understand how the game works on both sides offense and defense and Use them both to your advantage.
And so I Most business owners, just don't make money because they don't understand profit, right?
13:42
That's it.
They just, they still to themselves think that revenue or profit even though they tell other people are everything I make is and profit and they just do.
And I just don't know how to, I don't know how to drill this in, if you know what you gross every month and you know what, you take home every month, that is what in your mind, should be your profit margin and so when you sign up a customer for a thousand dollars or a hundred dollars a month and you know, it's 15%, then you should know that you're only making $15 a month in this person and you should act accordingly and you should Also think to yourself, man.
14:10
If I just add an extra 15 bucks a month, this client, I make twice as much money and answer is yes, you would.
So, how can I do that?
And how can I do that without taking on more work?
So I'll leave you with that for margin Madness.
I hope you guys have an amazing Saturday.
Please drop a like or a comment if you're, if you found this valuable at all.
14:29
Do not negotiate with terrorists, do not lower your prices.
When people ask you, for discounts, you need to stick and commit to your prices and I feel like it's a matter of Integrity of like, you look at yourself in the morning like this.
What I'm worth period, that's it right, period?
That is what I'm worth that is.
14:44
What the service is worth and until death.
Do you part or you make a strategic decision that for the next 90 days?
You're going to change the price and hold it strong, unless you make that, then you do not negotiate with terrorists.
All right, so your price is your price period and your margin is your margin and everything else is madness.
15:03
So lots of love having basic Saturday and I'll catch you guys on the flip side again, tag, somebody who needs to hear this, all right.
Bye.
Bye.

So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect, and let's rock and roll.

Hello, everyone and welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
My name is Alex and I am your host and we got into a really juicy topic last week.
And before I dig into what the to questions of persuasion are, if you are jamming on, you're watching this or excuse me, listening to this then and you don't hate money and you do is want to make more money with your gym.
0:34
Go to I don't hate money.com and apply and we have guys who will not sell you on the first phone call.
Leave your credit card home.
We just want to meet you and see if we can help you in any way we possibly can.
And even if it doesn't mean that it works with us, we'll still do everything we can out.
So, let's get to the main point, and it is the second question of persuasion.
0:52
So, just to recap for anyone who is just getting on, too many questions of persuasion are if this product service, which It does what I say it does and it gets you to your dream.
Is it worth this price?
And if you can get agreement on that question, then you can move on to the second question.
1:10
And once these two questions are affirmative you close the sale, okay, the second question is then what do I need to do?
Or what would you need to see in order to believe that that could happen for you using our system service widget project, whatever, right, what would you need to do to believe me?
1:28
That's the second question and it's important to ask because a lot of times people will just tell you.
Well, I would just, I just like the you don't have the I need to think about it because that's not what you asked them you to like, what do you need to believe me.
1:46
And and then you go do all the convictions of now.
The way that you convince people.
The most effective way of convincing someone is testimonials and social proof.
Okay?
So the ultimate social proof is I think about this from an ideal seen same point.
2:03
So, like, what's perfect situation?
Well, for me, it's a gym owner who said 10 friends, who have all done our program and all crushed the first program, and then all signed out for my second program.
And are now, literally doing four or five times, the revenue each month and not working as much as they were before because they have all the systems that we provide.
2:20
In order to make sure that that can Happen.
Right?
That would be you know DLC for me.
And that person comes to me, they don't need to see.
Screenshots are like dude, I saw a 10 of my friends go from broke to like making actual money and like being able to like you know, have the freedom.
They wanted to financially geographically and temporally as in time wise to live, right?
2:42
And so that guy, that's the perfect situation for me from a conviction standpoint, right?
And so that guy is really just like, if it does, what I say does is worth these, it's a yes.
And like, do you believe me?
He's like, well heck, yeah.
Sir, my friend the bit right now, if that's not the situation, what's one underneath that?
2:58
And then you have to ask, how can I manufactured those types of people, right?
And I'll tell you, you're saving to factor it, you want to have the buyers experience.
Look, B is choreographed as possible, so that when someone walks into the facility, from the time, you first communicate with them, to the time, to give you money, should be an experience that they feel, which is why we have a Facebook group where people share all their testimonials, okay?
3:21
So if anyone's listening this, you're on the face.
If you should go there and just engage with some of the people who've actually crushed it using our system, right?
But then after that person is, you know, set for an appointment, right?
Send them.
A link that has a bunch of testimonials and say, hey, please watch this before you commit, right?
3:37
And now, they feel like they've engaged with people who are a real customer.
So no means your real business, right?
And then be, who experience the results that they're looking for?
Now, mind you on your testimonials page that you are gonna send these people, which I highly recommend.
You do make sure that use different types of testimonials don't have all weight loss.
Have some that are men.
3:54
Have some that are female have some that are toning have some that are massive, weight loss amounts.
Have it in certain periods of time, have been over long periods of time.
Have one that shows that someone kept it off for two years.
Okay.
Capture all of these testimonials.
Okay.
Put them on a page and say, hey this is mandatory.
Please watch this before you start, if you want to make it one Sizzle video that you can do that if you're more tech-savvy, right?
4:13
If not just making a bunch of them and when they have that, then they're automatically beep.
Reframed to believe you more.
Okay, so step one.
Okay.
Now, They walk in your facility.
What do they see, right?
What is the waiting room look like what is the sales room look like?
4:29
Okay.
All my guys, all my gym words what is their cells from look like floor-to-ceiling?
Testimonials plaster like wallpaper testimonials all testimonials reviews everything.
Okay.
So that they can even see the wall and so when someone sits down with them and someone says well I don't know if I can I can hit that goal.
4:48
You just like you just kind of look around and you're like really And they've nothing to say, okay because the the testimonial speak for you and it's weird because like you can't boost yourself up but all of these third parties that you choreograph can write.
5:05
And so in those two questions of sales, one establishing the value and have an agreement, that it is worth the price that you're charging.
And then the second question is okay, well then, what would you need to believe me that?
You not only that it's possible, but that you Susan, you could experience the same results at all these people do.
Most Nation real quick.
5:24
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to fifteen hundred dollars.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
5:43
Okay, so the last question here that would potentially come up.
So most people, at this point are sold, I'll be honest with, you must be for so let's play.
They see, 200 people who are just like them who have gone to where they want to go.
They're like, well wow, you guys are really good.
6:00
Like I think it's worth it and it seems like all these people have done it and we're just like me like yeah I'll do it.
Like that's it like you've persuaded the person in there.
Okay.
The last piece that you need to overcome is limiting beliefs.
All right, and it actually, now this on the flipside happens, it happens about business is business and an emotional selling which is like weight loss because I like like people don't believe in themselves.
6:25
They really don't need some people like and it's everything is levels.
Like I have limiting beliefs and the the real limiting beliefs are the ones that you don't even know exist because they've even been challenged it so that person that limiting belief that they have you have to start attacking that.
6:41
And so the last piece okay well I believe that this program does that I believe that it helps people just like me and I'm like, okay and Susan what is the reason that you believe Is stopping, you would stop you from achieving that this thing, right?
7:00
And so then you can just dig into the actual reasons, why Susan thinks that she can't do it, right?
And this is where you might have to have a little bit of hand-to-hand, combats, a little bit of tactical overcomes like, well, you know, I'm super busy and that's where you say, well, here's here's twenty other moms who are, who are in your situation, working moms, single moms, and they actually said the same thing as you did, as you're sitting down in front of me right now.
7:23
Obviously, they signed Up in they did it and they got the result that you're looking for, right?
See how my glaring this and so you're like okay all these people and this is what Sandra did Sandra hired.
A nanny, two days a week and she was able to cover it and then that's how she did it, you know, Debra just did first thing in the morning, that's what she committed to.
7:43
She said that 5:00 a.m. was the only time that she could make it and she was going to do it, right?
And she stopped telling herself that she wasn't the type of person who could get up at 5:00, right?
She's not telling herself that she's not believing that lie.
So Susie, what's the like is that the only reason?
7:59
Well I've just never slept with anything.
Oh, well, here's here's 40 people who told me that he said that, they'd never stuck with anything.
Do you know why, you haven't stuck with stuff?
I don't know.
I still lost motivation.
Okay.
So it's probably a motivations of combination of results and ease of execution, okay?
8:16
So our system and this is where you have to get tactical and what our system, like we make it so easy that we've had people who don't speak English, and 12 year, olds who have been able to To do it.
It's color coded.
It uses your hand.
It's very simple to do.
Do you think you could do that?
You think you can use your hand?
8:32
And they're like, well, yeah, well you can read right there.
Like oh yeah, like you speak English?
Yeah.
Okay.
You're older than 12.
Yeah.
Then you'll probably be able to do it.
I'm like, okay, I like to use humor.
My sales fell like you get you hopefully your understanding where I'm going with this, right?
And then she might say so that that like we overcame, the time issue, we came overcame the secondary issue that she brought up, and then like, what else is the reason?
8:56
Well, I don't think my husband supports me.
Okay?
You know what?
Here's Monica Monica is husband.
Literally forbade her to sign up for anything.
He told her before she even got here, that she wasn't allowed to sign up for anything.
And no, she did.
9:13
She sign up anyways, to prove him wrong And and you know what she did, she proved him wrong and you know what happened after that he apologized and said, you know what?
You're so right.
I just I've just seen you fail so many times.
I just didn't want you to waste money right?
Or get disappointed but because of how good and then you go back and I because of this the three-pronged approach because of the system that we have because of the unique benefits, blah blah blah, like you are going to see that success and even if your husband doesn't support you, at the end of the day, we need to support ourselves.
9:43
The change has to come from within.
It's not him, it has to be you.
Because as soon as you can change your story, we can change your life.
So when we're looking back on your life and you're 18, you're looking at this day and you want to like don't you want that story where today was the day that everything changed for you?
Don't you want that?
10:01
What can be on you to do is let me help you?
I mean, like, this is like, these are the, these are the points.
This is how you ran this home, okay?
So this is the secondary, some point of the conviction.
So most of the time you're going to get the conviction.
If you have all those things set up that I said before, they're going to buy now.
If they don't, then it's a limiting belief in the new attack on women, believe in you, overcome these specific issues that they believe that have not been addressed in the sale prior, which gets a little bit tactic more to the program and how you overcome some of these day-to-day issues.
10:26
But these are easy to overcome, these are easy hand things, they're not I basically don't believe you or this is way too expensive because you overcome It was by asking it differently.
Okay.
So I think these last three bark at them, how to sell stuff.
I've been so, my best things like this is like these are like the real thing like, this is how you sell, okay?
10:46
This I you persuade people in this is ultimately, if you are in the business of helping people, you need to help people to make the decision to help themselves, okay?
And you owe it to them, to create a process that allows them to urge.
It allows you to maximally get people to make the right decision for themselves known as regretted getting in better shape.
11:04
Ever.
Right?
I mean I can't think of any right.
So then, like why don't they buy?
And this is how we approach those questions with these two key questions and that one side question on conviction.
And and this is how you get people to buy.
So, have an awesome day guys.
This one a little bit long but I hope you got a lot of nuggets from it and are able to sell more people and help impact more people's lives.
11:25
If you're a gym owner, you do not hate money.
Would like to see how we do, what we do and how we get our gym owners to massively improve their businesses, in a very short amount of time, go To I don't have money, not calm, and apply.
And will hop on phone with you and not try and sell you anything and just talk to you to see if we can help.
11:41
All right, so have an awesome day and I'll see you at home.







0:00
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
0:18
Welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Your Motors happy Monday.
Hopefully this video reaches you at a good time, wherever you're at?
0:38
This is, I think this is very important video that I want to make.
It's been on my mind for probably the last month or two, but it became apparent to me that we needed to clearly State our position.
And so I think it starts with context of where the industry is out right now, and then kind of how Jim launch sees ourselves best supporting the industry and Jim owners within it.
1:02
So right now, as I see it from the various sources that I've collected 25 to 30 percent of all independent gyms have permanently closed I believe.
And I said at the very beginning that I thought it would be 230 but I think I was wrong.
1:18
I think I underestimated how many more gems would actually not be able to stay in business and so I think that number May climb over the next six months to maybe 40 or even 50 percent of independently owned and operated.
Oh, he's the reason that I wanted to start with that.
1:34
Is that in the world of investments in finance?
They have a saying, which is in a, if you have, can pick between a strong operator and week in a weak Market, or a strong Market with a week, operator, in both cases, the market wins which is you can be the best, you know, entrepreneur in the world.
1:56
But if you trying to figure out something that helps newspaper companies you're probably Not going to succeed because newspapers are going out of business and I'm not saying that Jim's, our newspapers.
That's not my point.
The point is more so that just to illustrate growing versus static versus shrinking markets.
2:14
So, where do I think the market is going?
I think the gym industry has a very, very rough.
Next year ahead.
I think that the vast majority of consumers, as I said earlier, have already had the opportunity to switch to different Ennis vehicles.
2:31
I think that the brand of Fitness that we have to offer right now given the constraints in the political environment and what we are forced to do whether right or not are are massive constraints on the business, right?
2:47
We cannot create the experience that we have wanted to create for our customers.
We want to create a memorable experience for them, and I don't think that the constraints that are there, give us that opportunity.
I also think it creates tons of variability in.
Force and labor because we cannot predict how we're going to get shut down again, or if it's gonna reopen, or if there's going to be a spike or there's going to be new constraint or we have to do temperature thermometers, or this type of mask, or they have to know all of these different things massively way into.
3:17
And I don't know if you've just to illustrate this for you personally, I am not going out to eat at restaurants nearly as much mostly cuz I just don't feel like dealing with the hassle and I think that that is true, amongst many people who are looking at, At coming back to service based facilities, right now, if you're looking at, you know, if you're a woman and you're trying to get your nails done or you got your hair done or any of those types of things go in and ask them how business has been, right?
3:42
They have the same constraints that, you know, Jim has.
And many of those people would like to go back and have that desire and yet they have not.
And so, I think what we've done or what's happened in the marketplaces that, we've permanently trained, consumers to consume, or fill this need in a different way.
And I think just by nature of, you know, from 0 to 100.
4:00
What if we had a hundred percent of our clients before this?
If all of those clients are introduced to a new type of service or new solution for this need, am Mount greater than 0, we'll stick with that.
And so I I think that the market overall is shrinking and will continue to shrink for the foreseeable future.
4:21
So, to put this statement, open and clear, Jim launch is loyal to gym owners.
We are not loyal to Jim's my goal.
Goal is to equip everyone here in this community with the best opportunity vehicle to package their skills to be able to provide for their families, and be able to serve their communities.
4:40
In a way that makes them healthier that has been the goal since day one.
Jim's at the time, for the last 34 years has been a vehicle for that individual, which when put together with, you know, the gym want system creates a profitable business for the gym owner and creates a superior experience for the customer and helps you will get healthy, which is the goal.
5:02
To that end, Jim launched.
As a company will be pivoting.
And that is because I believe that the best opportunity for gym owners is remote for a variety of reasons.
I think that first off from a lead generation standpoint for most small businesses lead generation is the hardest thing in a remote environment or online environment.
5:24
You have virtually unlimited lead generation, you will never fatigue.
The United States is Need for weight loss.
You Don't even fatigue.
A 50-mile radius for weight loss, but a five-mile radius, it's definitely possible.
Right?
It's much more difficult.
And I can tell you this right now firsthand on the GLX side, the people that were working with foreign person versus remote.
5:45
They cycle through the copy and creative at three to four times the rate, it burns out much faster.
So there's more effort that has to go in for a lesser volume result at a higher cost and the lead cost, if you just think Conservatively.
6:01
If 30% of people are not going to like, people already have excuses to not going to the gym when they have no constraints.
But if you add even a little bit of friction toward something that they already kind of don't want to do then, that constraint May double.
And that's pretty much what we already seeing that lead costs on average across all the markets for in persons about $30, for many people that does not.
6:21
And that's for free offer right now, even paid, right?
That's average that some people might be better, some people worse, but this is just on average what we're looking at.
And so when we take these, Into account, right?
We can get way more leads at a way lower price with less effort and more consistency.
6:39
Factor one factor to the model itself.
How difficult is it to implement?
How much margin remains for the business owner?
How does it enable the business owners lifestyle in an online setting or remote setting the business owner can move and live wherever they want.
6:59
They don't don't have to be in a single area.
They can have freedom with their family.
They don't have to show up at the gym at four o'clock in the morning.
They don't have to be there until 9:00 at night.
They don't have to drive in for an appointment to have that person.
No shown that have another one at 7:00 at night that they just sit there and wait for.
7:15
Right.
A lot of those things that we've had to deal with is gym owners and small business owners in a brick-and-mortar setting no longer has to exist, all right?
And very frankly, I have always wanted to figure out a way to Make online work at scale.
7:32
Why?
Because you no longer Geographic constrained, you're far less temporally constrained and financially.
The model is more profitable period.
And as a court like, just from the business setting, that would probably be enough for me, but on top of that, many people achieve Superior results in a one-on-one setting, compared to a group or outside it.
7:57
Right?
Many of you have hired TK and have worked with Trevor have worked with an online coach, whether on the strength side or the nutrition side or body composition or whatever, and you did that because you knew the one-on-one attention allows you to get a better result, right?
8:13
If you had to change someone's life and you if they signed on, if somebody in your family are going to die.
What way would you train them?
If you had the option of group workouts or one-on-one coaching online?
If you had two, which one would you do?
8:30
Because if you say group workouts but then you'd start doing the one-on-one sessions.
That's not the model, that's not the question.
The question is which would you because that is realistically, what?
We're offering the marketplace.
All right.
And so I already said there was enough of a case from a business standpoint to make that argument.
But on the fitness component side, I believe that the actual fulfillment is better for the end user and is more profitable on top of that.
8:52
You have fixed margins in the business.
You do not necessarily need to have right now.
If you have to deal with the fact that you have rent, then that's a separate issue.
But the business model, Itself is not constrained by the sunk cost that decisions have been made in the past.
And the reason that I did not have an online business model until covid, hit was one because we didn't have to, but to because no model that I could find and I looked at everyone's out there.
9:19
Could be done at scale by anyone.
Without a superior skill set without having an authority or having a following or requiring an inordinate amount of effort.
For example, there are three primary models that exist in online today.
9:35
Excluding the GLX model that I'm going to talk about vehicle one outbound messaging, right?
We have the cold messenger training.
I bought two or three, ten thousand dollar courses.
I took all the best findings and I put it into Course for $37, right?
You guys all have access to it fundamentally.
9:52
Why is it not something that I see is enormously valuable because it requires effort, right?
Simply put you have to spend two, three, four hours a day.
Outbound messaging.
People does it work?
Yes.
Does it require ton of effort?
Yes.
10:08
Can you scale that not really right?
And so that is opportunity to go number one.
And if you've seen all the guru's of the last 30 years, the reason none of them have an enormous business is because the Uncle is not that good.
It's okay.
Right.
With an okay vehicle, you can build it.
Okay business.
10:24
All right, so that's vehicle.
One vehicle to is doing a webinar, so it's building out a sales presentation.
That edifies you generating traffic online to register for the webinar.
Watch the webinar pushing to an application that they then schedule a call with you.
So you can do a two thousand, three thousand dollar-plus sale, typically, those models do not make a ton of money one because the webinars fatigue to The cost per application is extremely expensive.
10:50
You're looking at a hundred dollar applications, many times 3, some of the people who I know that space who are experienced only get one, two, one, two, two, one up front on their hats, been with a high ticket sale.
And that's people who know what they're doing.
That doesn't seem like a model that I would scale to others.
11:08
Third model is doing it online.
Challenge model.
What that means is not the way that we're talking about it but they do group challenges.
So that's where you tell everyone to sign up for a group to five day challenge.
You make content day one through four and then you make a pitch on day four and try to get it removed a pitch on day three.
11:24
It doesn't matter point is that you're trying to solicit people from a free group or you provide value where you're somewhat edified to then get on the phone with you to buy some stuff, right?
Right.
And that model is, again, a very effort effort based model.
It's very stop-and-go, it's very clumpy.
11:41
And in my opinion, it's very difficult to scale which is why you don't see any massive online weight loss companies that just do these five doing on challenges.
And I'm going to say, massive, I'm saying, real massive not like small person - I'm saying, real big businesses and so, because of that, those are the three models that I saw that existed for people who did not have a following.
12:01
And it was not a consistent acquisition model.
I could not put my weight behind it because I knew that if I were to implement one two or three or all three of those together, the vast majority of people in our community would not succeed period.
It is what it is.
All right?
So the reason I like the model that we have now is that after all the trial and error that we've been able to create, we can start a new business, which is essentially, what this is overnight because in a semi regional market place.
12:31
So the same state is You, you have a certain amount of trust that exists.
With a free trial front end.
It does not require a tremendous amount of skill in order for you to sell it or skill the sales to someone else.
Try and Outsource a 3000 are high ticket Fitness sale.
12:49
You're not going to be able to do it.
Well, I can promise you.
All right, you having trouble, Outsourcing a 200 dollar sale.
Try Outsourcing a 3,000 dollar sale.
It's not going to happen.
Hey, if you're a return listener and you have not rated or reviewed the show, I want you to know that you should feel absolutely terrible about yourself and everything else in the world.
13:08
I'm kidding.
But it would mean the absolute world to me.
If you guys would go ahead and do that, you don't have to pause a show, you keep listening and you can just do it with your thumb right now will take you less than 60 seconds.
And like I said, the only way that podcast arose through word of mouth and this is you joining hands with me and helping as many isomers with possibly can because no one is coming to save us, it's just us.
13:26
All right, so please go do that now then let's get back to the show.
So, the front end, we know that the acquisition is easier because we have unlimited leads, that's massive for consistency of business operations, and for consistency of cash flow, right on the sales side or so, on the lead nurture side Alan is already solved this problem at scale, up to this point.
13:51
You couldn't get 800 leads, a thousand leads a month and have any any any dream of being able to work that lead flow without two to three full-time people, not going to happen right with Alan.
And we can do that and we can set the price at fixed.
So, you always know what it cost to get a new customer right on the phone, period for the sale itself for a free trial sale.
14:14
Someone with very, very low skill.
Set can still sell a free trial on the phone.
It is such a low risk offer.
And so the magic of the model is the fact that we have now found out after this whole Community has tried and tested it.
That the trainer is at that, we've built out my accountability right when paired with a free trial person in the model that we espouse, which is supplement cell number one and then abandoned hope number two.
14:38
Right.
Both of those sales are easy enough that you can scale them and break even or come close to it on the first transaction.
And then by day 30, you will be able to convert those customers at the same price as you were able to before in a gym setting, except you have far more of them, you acquire them for Less.
14:56
Staying at a higher profit margin, you no longer have to do sessions, there's no rent that you're that you're you're forced to do and ultimately there are many of you who over the last month have built out three or four thousand dollars a month recurring Revenue, that's in 30 days, right?
For those of you who like Marcia and hopefully didn't mean to call her out here she's built up.
15:16
Forty thousand dollars in recurring Revenue, Rose built out, another 40,000 dollars in recurring Revenue, she's been doing it as well.
All right, this model.
If you give it one month, two months, three months, four months, It is going to be far, superior to the revenue and profit that you were able to make it to Jim, except it has no signs of slowing down, right?
15:35
You do not have to be constrained by your Geographic five-mile radius.
If you've had the desire to impact your community in a much bigger way, if you've had the desire to not be constrained to the five miles around the location of your gym.
That's only valuable to you when your ads are converting because you have the combination as copy and and placements that are actually working in this specific Market at that time with the promotion made which is real talk, how it works, right?
16:03
If instead of having all that you can virtually have an unlimited front end and all you have to do is tweak the skills on the back end that you can consistently create because there's only three roles that exist in the model person, who sells the trial of front the coach And that's it, right?
16:21
And there's you as the owner.
And so as long as you, and if you want to add scale, you could have one person does all free, right?
But the point is that each of these roles getting someone to sell free, trial is not difficult, getting someone to convert on the same day off where they don't even have to pay on that day, which is like, hey, normally it's 59 today, it's 49.
16:38
You don't have to say, yes right now are so you don't have to pay right now.
Just say yes.
Right now you will use the card.
You have on file.
Many people can make that sale for the nutrition.
Hey don't need to buy all these things.
I choose you get this stuff to get.
Started right great.
Most people can make that sale.
These sales are not complicated, but can be done at absolutely massive scale and retain a customer at a two thousand dollar price point where you can acquire them in high-volume very consistently.
17:03
All right, and so I need everyone.
So I wanted to at least clarify this for everyone, in terms of where Jim watch is position, is in this Marketplace, we are going to be serving gym owners and we're going to be serving gym owners in the way that we know best, and we're going to align ourselves with the model that's going to make them the most money and very Currently, I'm going to be doing this because I believe that I would like to serve a market place that's going to grow and make the most money because the more money you make, the more money I make.
17:28
And you know that I'm a capitalist at heart and always have been transparent about my intentions, right.
My goal is to run a profitable wildly profitable business that grows fast, right?
And so to that end, if I'm at a B2B space, I have to align with the model that I believe, has the highest likelihood of success and profitable growth for my customers.
17:49
And so, for the foreseeable future, that is where Jim launch is going to be focused.
We're going to be focused on bringing the online Revenue to everybody here, and I can tell you that, if you have been on the fence, it is not going to get easier.
If you're, if you're if you're clinging to in person it is not going to get easier now.
18:07
Is there anyone in this Marketplace that I believe is better at running in person?
No.
Why?
Because they all bought my book to try and build their whole Tim coaching program, right?
Like the business, the business mentality, the business models behind That system are running in parallel, we're using the exact same skill, sets the exact same choreography of sales.
18:26
The only thing that's changing is that we're falling through an app, is that have been personal work out.
That's it, that's all the changing.
And so if you have the same five thousand dollars to spend on marketing, if you spend that same five thousand dollars in order for online clients you will make more money.
18:42
Simply put it is easier right now to get 50 new online clients than it is to get 50 in person clients.
And I don't see that Trend changing any time for the rest of 2020.
All right and it and the thing is is what I do feel is known is that the rest of 2020 is going to be shit for Jim's in general?
19:01
What is unknown is whether 2021 is going to get any better and so it's I feel like I've been I've been holding this back.
I've been hinting at it.
I've been alluding to it.
But I have not been able to be transparent in the fact that I believe this is the best model for this community.
19:18
I've been always loyal to gym owners and I believe that this is the best opportunity equal for you to package your skills.
Serve your community, serve your family and in terms of Roi on your time and your capital and the skills that you need to train your team.
19:33
On this model, I believe is more scalable more profitable will have higher Roi over the next 6 to 12 months, then the in-person model.
The Fallout questions that happened as a result of that as well.
What do I do with my own person business?
So there's something called a sunk cost.
19:49
Fallacy and economics, which basically means because I've invested XYZ before this moment, I'm going to use that to Cloud the current decision at hand, right?
And so it's like if I've spent I'm trying to hopefully everyone knows what Son cost is but it's basically you have a, you have a, you've made an investment that is Irrelevant in the, in the variables of the Right decision in front of you, right?
20:15
And you're using that like I committed to, you know, like I spent money on XYZ and alright.
Hopefully you get the point that being said, if you still need to make decisions about it, you have a couple of different versions that you can handle this with all right, one is that you can simply walk away from your gym and do what the ramifications of that.
20:32
I don't think that the court systems.
I don't think that evictions and creditors are going to be hitting hard on businesses that so clearly were affected by this.
I think that will have if there's ever a time that you'd be able to get out of a lease.
This would be, this would be the time where you would be able to get out virtually scot-free, and many of you already have.
20:55
The second solution is that you make enough money in the online setting that you can pay for it.
Because if you think about it, you have the same five thousand dollars that you're going to spend, you have, you're gonna have to spend it on whatever business you're doing, right?
If you spent it on the superior opportunity vehicle, you will make more net, money doing that.
21:12
That and then you can still like you will make more money doing that, even though you have this gym as your anchor.
If you spent 5,000 trying to fill the gym up because you have it versus spending five thousand dollars on something else, you will make more money and still be able to cover the cost better because the opportunity equal is superior Think about it.
21:30
Let it sink in.
All right.
And so anyways, my entire, my entire goal is always to make people.
The most money possible is to get this to give them the freedom they want.
Give them the security, they desire.
And I believe that this is the best way for us as a company to do that.
21:46
And so all of my focus will be to that end.
I do think that we were actually on the precipice and we're currently in a golden opportunity are aware.
This is huge amount of demand for online services and there's not a lot of Supply.
I don't know how long that we know is going to happen.
But for the people that take action, now, most of you already have, but if you were on the fence, this is the time to take that action.
22:08
What you don't know is that many of our seven-figure gym owners the top, guys.
You see in this group have pivoted, 100% online?
Some of the guys you hear me talk about their names, all the time, they've already sold their gyms and they pivoted 100% to just going on because they sell all the math.
They didn't let their emotions Cloud the Judgment.
22:23
Now, I understand that everyone listening to this, as human makes emotions emotional decisions and then puts a logic to them later.
So the let just speak to your emotions.
If you have the desire for more security, if you have the desire for Less unknowns in the future, if you have the desire to not have to worry about acquisition, not worry about where your next customer is coming from worry of whether or not your lead cost is getting to.
22:42
I worry about whether going to have to have just another creative, another home run is save the month, right?
If you don't want to have those concerns, right?
You want to be able to travel with your family.
Going to be able to leave your Jim for God's sake.
You know, I didn't take a vacation for five years.
I never even left is our so Freight.
22:59
I went back for For Christmas and every single year for three straight years came back after two days because I couldn't handle the stress of being gone, all right?
And so, if you don't want to deal with that, I do believe that there is a time limit of that.
We're in right now where the entire Marketplace.
Understands now what online training is and there is a massive, massive shortage of professionals.
23:18
Who have the skill set like gym, owners, right?
Like us, we are all very experienced Fitness professionals.
Are you compare us to some guy who's interested in Fitness on Instagram, right?
Or compare us to even even for some of your trainers, right?
We are more experienced in nail and so if you want to do the market a favor, let people work with the best professionals and that's you because they're going to do it anyways and they might as well work with you.
23:45
So, anyways, to wrap this up that is what all of my direction is going to be on, is going to be on executing the model.
Because this model, now is as clean as a whistle, in my opinion that you don't like this thing is, as As robust as the original Jim lost model, the front end offer is compelling.
24:04
We will always be able to get people to sign up for free things for weight loss.
Period.
That is something I can bet on second.
Do I believe that people can sell free trials at scale with low skill?
Yes.
Do I believe that you can sell supplements to people who want to lose weight in a one-step in upsell environment?
24:23
Yes.
Do I believe that getting people to stay on continuity at $49 week $39, League, $59 week is Something they will do for one-on-one training and support.
Yes.
Do I now believe that people prefer or value or get a superior experience from a 10-1 customized meal plan customized workouts and groups online.
24:44
Yes, I do and because of those beliefs that I have and you may not share those beliefs, but I've made some pretty big bets in the past in this space and most of them have been right?
And so I'm asking you To at least factor that in, if it's something that you're still on the fence about that, you at least consider the argument that I'm giving you right now because genuinely my interest is in making you money.
25:07
And so, our interests are aligned.
It's just a question of whether you believe the vehicle that I'm talking about right now is the best way most of you already made this call, but that is what we're going to be doing with Jim launch and it's been, it's been very transparent that the people who run that simple model can scale and can make a lot of money.
25:24
Because the only thing you We have to do is just make sure that you're fulfilling the clients using the app that automate say 80% of it.
Anyways and that is so much easier than having to worry about trainers sleeping with clients and broken equipment and cleaning out the bathrooms and getting the right music.
25:41
Like all of that stuff is gone now or it has the opportunity to go on if you make the choice.
Obviously, the choice is yours.
We will support you at Jim launch.
Independent of what you choose if you want to rock in person, we will help you.
All right, we've done it.
And I honestly think you're like Having seen and talked to, most of the people, in this industry with half of them being X clients of mine / ex-employees of mine, right?
26:03
With half of them being that I can tell you without any drop of doubt, in my mind that we are by far the best.
Not even close.
Like there's not like, oh yeah, we're like, we are ages.
We are eons above and the proof of that.
If they were as good at business as we are, then they would be bigger than us but they are not.
26:20
And so I would say trust the people have been doing this a long ass and doing this, the best of the biggest Biggest reach and biggest data set.
All right, if you want to stay in person we will try and set you up for the best success.
But given your skill set and your desires and your and your wants and needs.
26:38
I think that that same skill sets fires and beliefs will be better packaged in this vehicle.
The question is just whether or not you want to take the job.
Alright?
So anyways, for those who have made the jump, I think you made the right, the right call.
Hopefully, this entire video is just reinforcing that belief.
26:53
For those of you had made that jump for the You're not, hopefully just at least give you some transparency in a, why we're going to be talking more about online, why it's going to be my focus.
And all the clients that were going to be bringing in are all going to be Jim's who want to go online and or, you know, Xperience Fitness professionals who want to go online and scale because now for the first time ever, that's possible, Right?
27:14
You couldn't do this without an authority, can do this without a following before this but now you can.
So that is that is my perspective.
I hope that provides value to you.
I hope it provides clarity.
You in the direction of our company where I believe that the fitness industry is going and where we're going to be aligning, our company and we do that because we want to align on The Winning Side and I think that that is going to be the winning side.
27:39
No, 150 years from now, I would say, if you think about it, no 20 or should now be like man, who would have thought that in person gyms were going to survive this long, right?
That online fitness was not going to be bigger 10 years from now that it is now, right?
I don't think anyone's going to make that argument.
27:54
And so I think that it's It was time for me to make that make that Line in the Sand for us as a business of what we are going to focus on and that is what we are going to focus on.
So anyways lots of love as always we're still going to release plays, we're going to release, you know, the stuff that we do to help gyms because that is what we've always done.
28:12
But I just want to be honest about what I see so that you can be on the same page as me.
So lots of have an amazing Monday amazing week.








0:00
Hey, guys, real quick.
So Leila and I are definitely working on our social media presence, if you guys haven't noticed, and we're just breaking down into LinkedIn, All right.
It's not as bad as I thought.
It's actually been pretty awesome so far.
And you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, go ahead and let's connect and let's rock'n'roll most of the times.
0:18
And businesses are looking for more customers.
It's not that they need more customers.
It means that they need a Better Business.
Welcome to the Jim Secrets Podcast where you talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer, and the many failures and less that we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
0:35
Welcome to Franchise Secrets with your host Eric Van Horn, and today's guest is Alex Hor Mosey.
He's with Jim Launch.
I've seen this guy around for a while, Mark doing all kinds of cool marketing stuff, helping a lot of health fitness franchises out there, and probably even been a lot more people that are not in the franchising space.
0:56
And I've been wanting to.
Get to know him and get him on the podcast and we did that couple weeks ago.
So I begged him to get on the podcast and here we are.
So Alex, welcome to the show.
Thanks for having me honor to be here.
Absolutely.
So how many franchises do you actually work with?
1:15
Like if you had to give us the, the mix of franchises versus like regular gym owners, 30% of our, I think actually was higher than 30 because I asked my team, it's over 30, less than half.
I'll tell you that the gyms that we work with are with a existing franchise, so.
1:31
I want to get into your story, but I want to give everybody the context of like, who you work with and kind of what you do.
So you're not the normal Facebook ad agency.
You probably don't even like the word agency, so not at all.
So give the audience a little bit of of like who you are, what you do, and then I want to dive into like, how you got there.
1:50
Yeah.
So I would I just for everyone who's listening or just destroy the word agency because it anchors what we do in a totally wrong way.
For the last four years, we've never done any done for you services.
In the last 8 weeks, we started it done for you service side.
But I would say the vast majority of my business experience has been teaching people how to fish, not fishing for them.
2:08
And so that has been kind of the, the rallying call that we built our business off of.
And so I would say that most of the times when businesses are looking for more customers, it's not that they need more customers, it means that they need a Better Business.
And so that's why they struggle with marketing is because the rest of their business is broken.
2:25
So they cannot pay the cost of acquisition.
So they're always looking for ways to get cheaper leads rather than how to make more per lead.
And so our everything that we've ever done has been based around the same three ways of growing a business, getting more customers, making more money per customer and getting them to stay longer and buy more times within the concepts of a gym is staying longer.
2:42
And so that's what we focus on is kind of building the profit levers around the client.
And so we start with the offers that we're going to make them, the services that we can provide, the upsells that we're going to have along the way and then we back into what we can get per click.
And from there we're able to build acquisition systems pretty much in any vertical.
3:00
And we've done that obviously specifically within the fitness niche.
But we have a software that we do B to B for, it's B to B SAS.
We have a physical product company.
And so we've started four companies that done over 10, three that did over 20 million and one that did over 10 million in 36 months in the last 36.
3:22
Months in the last.
How how long were you before you 36 months ago?
Was it just Jim launch and then you've really drunk exponentially?
Yeah, 36 months ago it was Jim launch in a different way.
So we actually used to be kind of like a turn around company.
3:38
So I had a chain of 6 gyms my own.
I joined Russell's inner circle.
So Russell's inner circle for the people that don't know.
Russell Brunson, the founder of Click Funnels and I don't think he has inner circle anymore.
3:53
If I'm if I'm not mistaken.
Maybe it's the inner inner circle now.
Yeah, but he's got this inner circle which is almost like a mastermind as well and it's a so go ahead and give it like the audience Russell is and what the inner circle is Russell, sorry click funnels he's I think when he's he's one of the best Internet marketers in the world.
4:13
I mean, he's a he's fantastic at all components of that.
That's his level of mastery.
I joined his group before he was Russell Brunson and when I joined they had just done 10 million in a year.
So I mean.
They were just Alex.
Yeah, just just Alex.
4:32
And so I think that's that's when we joined, I was sold into the inner circle.
I really had no business being sold into it because it was an Internet marketing group and I wasn't.
I had six gyms.
Like, I really had no purpose being there, but ended ended up being the one of the best decisions that I ever made because as soon as I got there, I had my first call with Russell and he followed up with me after the call.
4:51
And he was like, you shouldn't be in gyms.
And he's like, so First off, can you speak in my event?
I never normally do this, but can you speak there?
And I was like, sure.
And so after I ended up speaking the event and I was not, I wasn't a guru.
I was not.
I wasn't teaching me to be.
5:06
I was still on weight loss in gyms, you know.
And so I went up there and had nothing to sell.
So I was like, this is what we do.
This is how we make money.
So we turn clicks to customers.
This is our whole thing and I had never been and still to this day never been more barraged after a presentation and I did not.
I wasn't selling anything and I had so many gym owners who were like, how can I work with you, how can I give you money And I was like, I'm not accepting like go make your own businesses like I don't want to be involved in this.
5:31
And so anyways one guy was like, here's my credit card, charge me $5000, just tell me what I get And I was like, this is very strange.
I'm like 20.
I'm in my young, like mid 20s at this point.
And so I called the guy up and I was like, Are you sure he's like, just do it.
And I was like, OK, you know, as I build him, he's like, what do I get?
5:48
And I was like, I don't know yet, but I promise I'll make you more than five.
Great.
And he was like, OK, fair enough.
And it turned out he was actually opening a gym.
I was like, so you're not opening.
He's like, no, I was like, well, why don't I go and launch your gym?
Because the thing that Russell had me talk about was how we filled up five out of the last six facilities.
6:07
We opened them at Full Capacitor the first day and I thought that was normal.
I thought that's how you were supposed to open a gym.
And I was like, well, why would you open one of them?
So that's right.
And it turns out that that wasn't as common of a practice.
And so anyways, I went out there and ended up doing 191 customer sales at 600 a head in 19 days, launching his gym.
6:30
And so I made, whatever, 120 grand in that time period.
And I looked around and I was like this is pretty chill.
Like I didn't have to do anything else.
I was like this is actually not a bad business model.
And so, you know, word started to spread that I was just doing these launches where I'd fly out and fill a gym up in 21 days.
6:49
That's what I did.
So like I'll take your gym from wherever you're at to full capacity in, in less than a month.
And so that's what I would do.
I was doing it for free, free with quotes.
They didn't have to pay anything.
I would take 100% of the upfront revenue that I was able to generate and then they would get the customers on the back.
7:06
At that point, you weren't teaching them to do it.
That was a done for you, A 100% done for you, yes.
And then you were.
Then you came into Russell's group, and he And wait a second, where?
Where did Russell's group fit into this?
I met Russell, I spoke his event.
This guy then then was like, hey, and I and I was like maybe I'll give this a shot, this new thing, you know.
7:26
And then that started to started to work And so we scaled, scaled our sales team to 8 guys within two or three months, 8 gyms a month you're flying out.
So eight guys, 8 gyms a month, you were flying them out there.
They were spending 21 days to launch the gym, the gym owners, all they wanted was customers.
7:43
They didn't care how they got them and you were taking all the upfront risk on it, but you were getting 100% of the reward.
They are left with figuring out retention and I would teach them that I did the acquisition, but then I taught them, I was like, here's how you're going to up sell them on the back because she can sell supplements.
7:59
Here's how you're going to convert them into members, use the price points.
And then I.
This became an iterative process that now is we, you know, we wrote the book on it, like how to step by step, how to turn the levers in the gym to make it more profitable.
Because this is like also when you interact with all these gym owners, I'd find so many little things, but that's really cool that you do that.
8:16
Like the rest of your shit's wrong, but that's really good.
And so I ended up picking like none of these things that I did were were original.
I just was able to aggregate all of these best practices into like kind of a playbook of this is how you make a profitable gym.
So basically when I go there, I would say this is what you should do.
You're a grown ass, man.
8:32
You can make your own decisions, but this is what would make you more money if you chose to do it.
And you should be able to adopt because at that point I was just some kid from the Internet that promised them clients.
And this was part of part of the problem with the model is that they're like, okay, you're going to sign up 150 people, like, sure, right?
8:50
And then they would have, they would go from 70 members to 270 members in 21 days and their shit broke.
And it was ugly and they were not happy and I was like, I'm fulfilling my problems here.
Even though you tell them about that on the front end and that's a real issue, I mean anybody going growing that fast or you think you want a lot of customers, you may not want a lot of customers right away.
9:13
No.
And they couldn't.
I mean and typically and unfortunately a lot of the guys were reaching out to me were not operationally strongest by their struck.
And so they were looking for a $0.00 down, you know totally done for like no risk out of pocket and but like and that's what you get, it's you're going to have somebody who's going to come in and sell their sell their asses off.
9:30
And so that's what we did and we were doing three $400,000 a month, very slim margins though because we had, I had flights hotels, I had flights hotels.
Yeah, a lot of time out there daily for their car.
I had the food, like there's just a lot of stuff that I had to cover.
9:48
And so when I did it, it was super profitable.
But you know, when I had, when I had to scale the team, it was less so.
And then it kind of started to have hair on it.
It was three or four months into, like when we were like really scaling, had eight guys going out.
But I had two gym owners in a week get up in the middle of every class for a day and tell all the clients to refund because they weren't holding the money.
10:08
They were like, I can't deal with this, just go home and refund and I'd already paid for.
I'd already covered everything like we were gone and so we ended up getting this huge.
I did like 100,000 in refunds like a week and I was like and at that time for me that was a a big amount of money and.
10:25
I was just like whistling margin.
That's that's big.
That's why rational design doesn't work.
Like I I was planning on getting, I was getting, putting, getting out of the gym industry.
I was like, you know what?
And I had sold my gyms at this point.
You know, like I, I sold the six and I was like, OK, you know what we're really good at marketing and sales.
10:42
Leila, who's my wife now, like she lost 85, the fitness competitions, all that stuff.
And I was like, why don't you be the face And then I'll run this as the marketing behind it and we'll just join a fitness brand.
And that started to work.
And so we started doing 1000 a day within 14 days online.
And I was like, cool.
What's the timeline on this?
10:58
The timeline.
So you meet Russell, you speak on stage, someone gives you $5000.
All the sudden you have a bunch of people out helping people get a bunch of customers.
That starts to break down.
This was one year, so I joined Russell's thing end of January.
I spoke in February.
11:15
I got my first 5000 deposit in like March.
I went out and launched my first three gyms myself back-to-back to back in the same area.
It just worked out that way in June, July, August.
And then at that point I decided this is what I'm going to do, sold my gyms, all of them.
11:35
Within 90 days of that point, I was 100% out.
I decided in August and I was 100% out by first week of November of the gyms.
And then at that point I took a pause on the launches because I was dealing with selling gyms.
I took a pause in October and November and then December I started with six guys.
11:58
So I was like cool, This is the model and we got six sales guys.
We started in December and they all started the day after Christmas.
That was one calendar year and then the next three months of the next year or four months.
The next year is when we were when we were really kind of scaling doing a gyms a month or whatever And then April, end of March, beginning of April's.
12:18
When I was like, I saw the writing on the wall, I was like this is, I don't like this model.
Like this is like the revenue was great and I was just like, but it just had too much hair on it.
And I I had people being upset with me for filling their gym up.
And if I if they're like, well, I can only take 50 customers, I'm like, well, I'm not going to, it's not worth it for me alone.
So I can sell 100 or more.
12:34
Like you have to be able to take 100 or more clients, which is, you know, 50 or 60 grand, you know, for us to cover everything and make a profit.
So anyways at this point now this is March, April, I was like Layla, why don't we start selling your thing, Let's just try that and then we can take the 8 sales guys, bring them in, do 1000 a day each and do you know, 250 a month.
12:55
But it's a higher margin.
Great.
This model works like we can do this.
And so I actually had eight gyms that were supposed to launch in May.
And so I called them up and I was like, hey, because I had to plan them out, you know, because you can't, like, immediately need, you know, which is another operational pain in the ass.
But you have to get the exact amount of gyms as you do salespeople or you have a guy on the bench doesn't work, the eight guys.
13:15
And so I called them up and they were like, dude, I need you to come.
Like, I'm, I'm maxed out my credit cards.
I premortgage refund as my house all my life facing to this like we have to come like we're like we're going out of business and I was like well I don't have to come like First off but that makes you sound like a Dick, but I just.
13:36
Like, I can't what we talked about, I mean at least you're not a liar.
And so finally this, you know the phone call, I was like, you know what man, I'll show you how to do this because consider this my going out of business sale like I'm getting out of the gym industry.
13:53
I'm just going to focus on fitness, show you everything I've got.
They were like, OK, well how much?
And I at the time picked the highest number I could think of, which was $6000.
That was like the highest.
I was like, this is ridiculous.
And I was like, I'm giving you the thing that I'm doing 400,000 a month with and I'm going to give you everything.
14:10
Like everything.
I was almost feeling a guy was getting ripped off on something and they were like, the first guy was like, yeah, And I was like, really?
And I picked a big number because I also didn't want to do it.
Yeah.
Because I didn't want to have to, like go make a court.
I just was like, let me just get him to say no so I can move on to the next call.
14:29
And he said yes.
And I was like, oh, we got.
And so I had seven more calls, and they all said yes.
And the first one said six.
Next one, I was like 8.
I was like, OK, yeah.
The next one I was like, it's 10.
They're like, OK and.
But and so anyways, we went up to 12 by the end of the day.
14:46
And then the next hundred we sold at 12 and the next 2900 we sold at 16,000.
It's interesting.
It's so, I mean, when we think about prices, these stuff, the stuff is just pulled out of thin air and what the market demands, right?
15:02
It's how much someone's willing to pay.
Yeah, Dan Kennedy, your prices, whatever you can say without cracking a smile.
And so I looked at Layla after we did $60,000 in a day.
And I looked at her and I was like, babe, we're still in the gym industry.
I was like, we were just doing it.
And so for me I think those one of the biggest lessons was there's different ways to monetize a skill set, right.
15:23
Like we had this skill set and I had, I had it in a gym opportunity vehicle like me running locations.
I had it in a done for you sales team opportunity vehicle which is different.
And then I had it in a information package kind of done with you version and that is when it that's when everything just took off and we did 180,000 our first month, we went from there, we did 10 million in our first ten months of business in total right now it was a rocket ride.
15:51
And I mean the big part is the first guys who signed on this lowest guy made 30,000 in their first 30 days James, right.
So I mean like and and they called me up and they were like what do you have, what else do you have?
And I was like, it's like I have this other program called Jim Legacy.
16:10
So in reality like, so you know I started a mastermind for franchisees, real low ticket, not very expensive for franchisees to come in because they're not you franchisees aren't used to the mastermind thing.
So I just started that up a couple weeks ago, Franchisee mastermind for anyone that wants to take a look at that.
16:25
But you were in Russell's inner circle, Russ.
It's it was a mastermind as you're going through this process, how much?
And he's a brilliant guy.
How much did he help you?
Unpackage some of the stuff or think differently because I see so many people struggle because they're in the gym industry.
16:42
They think that's what they're good at, but they're they just don't have the practice or the mental ability to think differently.
So I'll say two things.
I've been a part of multiple masterminds.
I think the best masterminds.
Well, I won't say that there's different types of masterminds that will give you different things.
17:01
And so if you're in an industry specific mastermind, those almost always pay for themselves like it's it's almost impossible to not know what all the best practices are, what's working right now, new plays, new hooks, new offers that are working today from a group that's working again.
And in an industry typically they're separated geographically.
17:20
So there's not a lot of, I mean some people are always scarcity mindset, but most people are very giving and in our community we give a lot, So they give a lot.
I think those are really like incredibly valuable.
On the flip side, when you go across industries, that's also very valuable, but in different ways because you have people in like hotels, charging deposits, you know, like, I wonder if I could use that in the fitness world.
17:39
Like how can I, how can I use that in my, you know what I mean?
And so I think you, you get more creative input and I come out with more ideas from a more general mastermind than I do from a specific one.
But the specific one aren't ideas.
I'm like, all right, when we go home, we're going to use 10 things, you know, that's.
17:56
It's very tactical.
Industry specific is very tactical.
You're going to get stuff there that's super tactical relevant, like you said to today, you make money tomorrow.
Exactly.
And then you're in some of these that are not industry specific where you might even feel like a fish out of water because it's so different.
18:12
But I like being a part of those at different times because it doesn't challenges the way you think and people are taking what they know in their industry and giving you ideas and vice versa.
I mean, that forces you to get better, but you have to be intentional on, on doing it and getting something out of it, right?
18:29
Yeah, The doers are the, you know, the only 20% of the people that are there, like 60% are there because they just want to brag.
And the other 20% sign up and no one knows why, but they just want friends.
I mean, so I talked to Russell about this and he was like Bill Glazer had told him, yeah, the way mask runs break down is like he's got, I think, I can't remember the exact numbers, but it was like you've got 10% that just always want more and are just like massive executors and just like want to rip as much value out and then just execute.
18:53
Yeah, it's like and then a lot of people just want to brag.
They want a place that they can brags a strong word.
They just want a place that they can like be candid about what they're doing and have people say, like, dude, that's awesome because a lot of us, especially business owners, it's really lonely.
You can't be like dude, we fucking crushed less because your customers don't.
19:10
No, they really don't care.
Like how much money did you make?
And a lot of friends of your friends and your circle of friends, wherever you are, really don't care.
Yeah, especially if you're doing better than them.
It's like it just makes it.
Also, it doesn't make them free either, so no.
19:26
Anyways, so there's there's that.
Unless they're really good friends, in which case it does make them.
Feel good 100% that's exactly it.
That's any that that well that's how we just.
Found out how you have really good friends that that's a litmus test.
Did you ever get concerned?
I mean, I know you're not a scarcity mindset type guy, but you're teaching people the playbook.
19:43
How do you, how do you reconcile teaching people what to do, kind of giving them the secret sauce and having people rip you off?
Because that's what happens, yeah.
If you're learning from me, you're inherently admitting that you're not better.
Than me.
True.
Or at least if you're copying my shit, you know what I mean?
19:59
Like you're nearly back.
And so the other thing is.
The best move to make would be to copy our stuff, right?
And once you're the industry leader, my strategic best move is to buy everyone's courses who's new, rip out anything that's good, immediately distribute, and then make you irrelevant.
20:18
That's how you just defend the top.
The guys who can't stay on top don't do that.
Yep, And that.
And then they become irrelevant over time, right?
And it's usually because of ego.
It's like, no, our stuff's better.
I'm like, I don't care where it comes from, like if messenger, but some guy's got to get messenger course, cool.
20:33
Go find it.
Information is information, right?
It is what it is.
So I'm also not immune to the fact that like, I know what industry we're in.
Information is very high margin but has massively declining value.
It has an expiration date on it.
And so the information always has to be fresh, always has to be cutting edge in order to have the value that you're charging for it.
20:52
And so we pride ourselves on, we release new plays every 14 days in our community.
Most guys have like quarterly things that they'll maybe do and most times this recycled content And so that's how we've been able to continue to provide value and and basically I built our our our highest level taking out everything I hated about masterminds for myself.
21:16
I don't want to do hot seat right because I don't care what nine of these 910 of these guys are because they're not they're not making as much money.
You know what I mean?
Like I just didn't.
So I was like, I want just give me the just give me the best stuff.
And so we just would rip out all the best practices, stack them in terms of is it lead generation, is it lead nurtures its sales, is it fulfillment or ascension?
21:35
And then we'd be like cool who's struggling with these things, All right.
These are the things that are working right now.
This is what you need to do.
So we cycle through what we're releasing and it keeps our content very fresh.
But yeah, in terms of so.
What I'm hearing, so part of what you have is you have a community.
21:51
Of people that are paying you for, for the stuff that you're providing them, but out of that community, you're extracting the best stuff that they're learning out there as well.
And then you patch it up, give it back to them based off of what you're getting it from the community, Is that right?
22:07
Yep.
And we run usually about two tests a month, two big tests.
I mean we run zillions of split tests and stuff from a marketing standpoint, but like conceptual tests of like let's try this new upsell, let's try this new offer, let's try this new back end thing or whatever it is, do you know what I mean?
22:24
And and that's stuff that will regularly release like we have another one that's kicking off on Wednesday, which is super cool and fun for online stuff.
So like we're we're always just trying things and I would say you know two out of three don't demonstrate a market improvement.
22:40
And so sometimes people just release things because it's new.
And so when we do our beta test, we go on beta test, we'll take 20 gyms minimum, which by the way is bigger than like most of the competitors that like their entire business, but that's okay.
So I'll take 20 gyms and we'll take it from representative markets, I'll take winners, I'll also take losers.
23:00
And when I say that, I say that nicely, but like I'll take my bottom 30% and my top because a lot of times if you just do tests for the top 10%, it's not good data because they just execute anyways, right.
So it's like I need a, I need a good idea of whether this is representative and then I have to make a training and deliver that training the same way I would to everyone at scale.
23:19
Because if I if I do a different delivery mechanism, if I do one-on-one coaching for all these twenty guys, again it's not going to be the same as what everyone else is going to consume.
So I have to make that again, provide it for them and then say good luck, let's track the stats in 30 days.
Most times most tests don't make a big difference and I think that's one thing that most markers ever want to admit.
23:38
It's like you split test the two button colors most times nothing happens.
So it's really trying to figure out which of these, which of these levers are the ones that really move the needle.
And a lot of times you just don't even pick the right lever to try and move, which is just a fun thing for us.
23:55
But when we do find one, we'll take it out, we'll package it, and then we'll just distribute it through the entire network.
Hey, it's Eric here.
I hear from a lot of people that they're looking to buy their first brand or maybe their second or third brand and they're not sure where to start or they're not sure they're looking in the right places.
24:13
Well, that's where I come in.
I help people find really good brands.
And if you're thinking about your second or third or maybe your first brand, let's set up a time to talk.
You can go to talk with eric.com.
That's Erik talk with eric.com.
Now back to the show.
24:35
Now a lot of franchisees out there, they they're used to using the traditional agencies and this is kind of in in in my mind.
This is giving them an inside look into Facebook ads and any type of advertising and copy, which is the words on a page or words on a Facebook ad.
24:53
And and you're kind of getting the inside scoop here.
This is the stuff that most franchisors don't know about and don't care about.
They have a CMO.
That is used to placing ads somewhere, hiring an agency to do it.
25:11
And usually it's a big agency and usually things are done in just, you know, plug and play.
And then you can get into more boutique agencies or even bigger agencies that really understand what's going on in the industry.
25:27
And I think that's what we're talking about here are there's a big difference between an agency that places an ad.
And they really don't know what goes on behind it.
And they're dealing with a franchise or who doesn't understand the social world, the digital world, they don't understand copy, they don't understand video.
25:42
They don't understand any of that stuff.
And that combined with a a bad agency is a recipe for very mediocre results.
And so when you get a franchise or that has a really good CMO that understands the current digital world.
25:59
Environment and they work with people like Alex and some of the other guests that I've had on that really understand marketing that's when you have a a very powerful combination and I know that you've seen it with different franchise out there and and sometimes if you know this is a franchising show franchise, I love franchising franchises are great but they're also it's it's also that doubleedged sword you are restricted in, in some of these areas and so.
26:27
Can you just give a little bit of what you see and talk to new people that are thinking about starting a franchise as a franchise or what kind of mindset should they have in terms of marketing to help their franchisees with this type of stuff?
This is we're talking about Source, right?
26:44
Franchisors, because the franchisees, they're stuck right now.
Whether they have something really good or really bad, they're stuck.
But there are people out there because I help people.
Baders Cooling and I, we have a we have a group where we help young franchise Ors.
Or people that want to buy a franchise, we help them start and scale their franchise.
27:00
So talk to that person that's just getting started in franchising as a franchise or you have to know acquisition that's I mean that's my that's.
What is it?
What if they don't even know what acquisition means because acquisition is so common to you and I, but to the average person out there, what do you mean acquisition lead Gen. show Gen. appointment Gen.
27:22
You know everything that gets from Click to show or whatever your vehicle is for conversion.
For like for your sale, whether it's a phone sale or an in person sale, you have to know the numbers inside and out for your model.
You should have already squeezed all of the juice out of your model before trying to put it together.
27:39
I can't say the amount of gyms specifically where I know somebody who's got a struggling gym and says, I think I want to franchise, I'm like you can barely run one location profitably and do you want to franchise and sell this bag really.
They also have to understand that like the business model has to be unique in some way.
27:55
Otherwise you're just going to get that, like why would they buy yours?
But like it has to be unique in a certain way in order for people to buy into it and also for the general population to want to have a, like have for you to make a disproportionate amount of money compared to other franchises in the same space.
I think the fitness franchise world is very saturated and I think there I think there's going to be a nice consolidation that's happening right now.
28:17
There absolutely is and there's there's always opportunity within within all of this.
But yeah, 100% and understanding that what your level of execution is, cut that into maybe 35% of what you're doing.
And that's what the level of execution you get from a franchisee.
28:33
And the moment you start pointing blame and saying you're not doing enough is the moment you lose the power of your business.
Because the moment you start blaming franchisees is the moment you stop innovating to try and solve their problems.
And so it's just not good enough to say they just didn't do it.
There's nothing you can do with them to say, right, There's nothing you knew about that.
28:51
So what, like, what can we control?
Like what condition did I create that tolerated this level of performance?
How can I make the training better?
How can I make the onboarding and screening better?
How can make the qualifications higher?
How can I, you know, whatever it is, is we have to ask better questions because ultimately the end of the day, especially with the franchise, it's all about EDA production, right?
29:09
They have to make money now, if you like, It's easy to sell your first ten friends that you know that senior quote business success, your first ten locations, everyone can do it.
That's why there's a zillion 10 to 20 location franchises, right?
And they can never make it past that because their actual business model sucks.
29:27
And that's what it is, you know.
And so you have to make sure that the actual, like this is just fundamentals baseball.
This is blocking and tackling, like is the training for every position dialed in?
Is it like, do you have a culture that you like?
Chickfila has done it well.
They don't even really have a franchise.
29:42
They.
We'll use that as an example because they're they're, they're a kind of a franchise.
But yeah, that mean the culture Holy cow, right And and and they know exactly who their, who their avatar is.
So it's like unless you have a unique avatar right or unique way of reaching it or unique monetization model or unique you know, acquisition model.
30:02
Now the hard part with acquisition is it's easy to copy.
It's it's very easy to copy, which means I think that you need to be on top of it because I I had a conversation with franchise or last week I went 22 locations kind of a smaller franchise or and I was like well give me your numbers on this and it's like I honestly don't know any of them.
30:20
And I was like how do you have a business, you know it's like well we don't know anything of the the lead and stuff and I was like OK then what do you, what do you do?
It's like, you know, he literally said we pretty much do the same thing as everyone else.
Like with the, you know, the fitness, nutrition kind of like pushes the same thing.
I was like, but I didn't say this and if you are listening to this, the person I talked to.
30:39
This was, this was months ago, this conversation.
Years ago, 10 years ago, I had the conversation and how can you make decisions?
People know me, who know me well enough that, like, we're data pores, you know, like all we do is track everything.
30:55
And then all of a sudden people think you make great calls when you have good decisions, but good decisions are based on good data.
And then I'll like, you know what?
The pandemic we have right now is a perfect example.
I'm not going to go in that direction, but I'm just saying it's a perfect example of how not having good quality data leads to poor decisions.
31:12
And so different people are coming to different conclusions based on what they perceive the value and the validity of the data debate.
Yep, that was a middle St.
That was a middle of the road.
No, it's true.
It's true.
Whatever it is, Whatever side, if you like, extreme on both sides.
That's right.
31:29
Based on the data that you believe to be true, yeah, most people think that people dying is bad.
Like most people agree with that.
Most people also think killing the economy is also bad.
And so if given the correct information, most people values are pretty much aligned.
It's just to to what degree are we waiting these metrics?
What's the truth on that?
31:49
We don't need to go there.
Yeah.
So we're getting there.
Yeah, I'll reel it back.
But the big thing is if you don't know your, like if you're starting a franchise and you don't know your lifetime value, cost of acquisition, your monthly churn, your different levels of like your value letters, your different upsells the way that you.
I mean it's there's just there's so many things that if you don't like, like even your page conversion measure, like if you don't know these things, if you don't have another way.
32:12
And on the flip side of that, there's some acquisition only franchisors that just learned how to run Facebook ads and then they're like, cool, I just run Facebook ads to a gym.
I own a franchise again, and they usually are not good operators.
They don't know how to build culture, They don't know how to lead teams.
32:29
They don't have unique backends.
They typically don't make enough per customer, right?
And then there was a point that I was gonna make here.
I can't remember what it was, but.
Well, this is all system.
This is all knowing your numbers.
This is all knowing what you should give your number.
That was my point.
Yeah.
You gotta know what backends, yeah?
32:46
Because you don't in franchise and again we're speaking to when we're going to get back to franchisees.
But franchisees you can, you can, I mean you can dial this in yourself if your franchise or doesn't.
But if you're starting to, if your mom and pop wanting to franchise your business, you don't have to have something that is proprietary.
33:04
You don't have to have something that is super unique.
What you need to have is a good model itself that you're working on right now, that makes money, that does well, and then you need to understand.
That you are not just scaling what you have now but now you're in the business of helping other people franchise their get get into franchising and you you're now their coach you're their cheerleader and you're the one that should have all the answers.
33:27
So if you don't know it for your own business right now, spending your.
Get that dialed in note in the ins and outs of your business so that you can help somebody else do the same thing.
One of the other things along with generating leads is I see franchise Ors and franchises they don't have really solid systems on a consumer facing the follow up, the nurturing to help a lead become an actual customer and I know that you're you're beast at that so talk about that for a little bit.
33:58
This problem has been a problem for since I had my first gym right when I work the leads I get three times as many people in the gym as one of my employees did and it's because it just takes a lot.
It's just hustle like there's no secret to getting lease to show besides just work and repetition.
34:13
So there's four I'm going to go real quick on this because there's a lot I can cover.
So there's four pillars to lead nurture to get the highest mental lease to show.
We got volume of outreach to the number of times you reach out to them.
The personalization behind the outreach, which is how catered to the messaging, is it for that specific avatar and their goal, the speed which has two components, the speed of from opt in to first contact and also the speed of response at any point between then and their appointment.
34:37
So someone messages you, they opted in, you message them, but then they ask you a question of like am I need to bring my kid or do you take adults or whatever, right.
If you they don't get a response and not a timely response, they're going to already.
That's going to be an indicator of the level of service they're going to get before when they come in.
And so that will decrease show rate.
34:52
So speed IS22 parts there.
And then the 4th one is availability, which is probably the secret weapon of what we've been able to figure out with the data science team that we have on our SAS company, which does all the nurture, which Eric was alluding to.
Availability is the single greatest predictor for throughput on a campaign.
35:11
If you do not have time to meet with prospects, you will not get prospects to show.
If 711 were only open from 7:00 AM to 9:00 AM, there would not be a lot of customer.
It doesn't mean you have to sell all day, right?
Who wouldn't want to sell all day?
But it doesn't mean you have to be available to sell them.
35:26
And that is kind of the big difference.
And the people who who crush and the ones who don't are the ones who are like, I'm available two hours Tuesday, Wednesdays and Fridays.
It's like, well, like how do you think you're going to hit your goal if you only have six hours of 160 that you're that you're selling?
Like, in what world does that make sense for you when you say you want to hit this extra 100 members in 90 days?
35:46
Show me logistically how that could even work.
If you're only closing one out of three and you have two hours, three days a week, that's six hours.
So that's that's two hours of closes that you're going to have per week.
How are you going to grow?
It doesn't make any sense and a lot of people don't even do that math.
That's the the theoretical side of of lead nurture.
36:04
But the the story for how this started was, I won't go too far back, but basically it was the biggest problem that we saw.
Between the highest performers and lowest performers, I can double someone's clothes rate going from 30% to 60%.
That takes time and effort, but we can do it right.
But my lowest performers on a lead nurture side, we're at 5% of their leads showing up versus my highest guys, we're at 45 or 50%.
36:27
So I'm talking about a 10X differential throughput compared to a 2X differential include improving someone's closing percentage of skills.
And so when I saw that and I saw pickup rates going down over time, I was like I'll bet you and with with machine learning where it's continuing to improving it better and the the aggregate mass is going towards messaging.
36:45
I was like I'll bet you that we could put something here that could take care of this.
And so it took us two years to put the the software together that and we ran I'm a data guy lots of data throw said a million and a half texts in the last like 8 weeks.
So like we have a lot of data that we work off of by doing that we were able to take the biggest painfully or bottleneck in acquisition out of the way.
37:08
And so now especially if you're franchise or listening to this, for me, I, I, I function very similar to you, right.
So if I've got 500 facility, we have 600 now, right, that are working with us actively.
And I know my bottom third are the ones who are going to churn, they are the ones who are going to struggle.
My top guys always win, right, because they're winners.
37:25
But if I could just get all of my bottom 3rd to above average or even just at average that would change the game for me.
And that's pretty much what we did with Allen, which is the software.
So we just plug it right into their website and then it functions as that lead nurture specialist and it does it for less and it does it better.
37:43
So lead nurturing it is.
It's e-mail.
Follow up, it's phone call.
And it's text messaging.
Yep, 100%.
And so.
I mean, honestly, we even looked at the difference.
We don't even e-mail anymore.
Not to say that emails at work, but if you can get someone via SMS they're gonna be the most.
38:01
I mean really, I mean they're, I mean that's smart.
I mean, of course it's smart, but a lot of people still don't even know that.
That's smart though, Alex.
I mean, what's the number, what like what percentage of people open up a text or view a text versus an e-mail.
So the industry averages and there's new people like on a list it's 10% if it's the new person who opted in for something and you can get 40, you know, 30 to 40% opt rates depending on the offer, right, sorry, not offer, excuse me, open rates depending on the offer on a text, it's virtually across independent of what you're doing, it's 98% plus of texts are open.
38:30
So right off the bat, you're getting three times as many people to even see the nurturing process that you're doing and the likely that they respond is also much higher via SMS compared to an e-mail.
And so because of that, the speed of response, the communication cycle, it just makes way more sense for us to just get people booked in 2 minutes rather than e-mail two hours later, e-mail like and then they forget it goes down the inbox etcetera.
38:52
We have to say this.
If you're new to all of this, or you're trying just to test some of the stuff out on your own and you're sending text messages, you can get in big trouble doing that, right?
You have to.
You have to make sure that anyone who's opting in is opting in for prerecorded phone calls and SMS.
39:08
But like, there has to be a disclaimer box and they need to check it before they opt in.
Otherwise you can get fined $150.00 in SMS, which is, and it's like a DUI.
It's an egregious amount of money on my design to make sure that people actually.
Do so.
We've covered a lot of stuff right now.
Today you're doing something that I've never really seen before.
39:28
It's so tell the audience, and I know we're running up against a deadline with our time together.
What are you doing and how are you helping and who are you helping?
Just talk about the software in general, because that's probably makes more sense, is that we plug the gap that virtually every brick and mortar business has.
39:45
Because almost every brick and mortar is based on the old model of acquisition, which means most people used to 10 years ago, call a phone number that they saw from an ad or they saw on a website or they saw from a flyer or a radio or TV or whatever or direct mail to get booked for an appointment.
40:00
And then all Jenny at the front desk had to do was pick up the phone and then schedule them.
Very simple.
The problem is marketing shifted and now it's based on digital optins.
You got name, phone or e-mail and then something has to happen to get them to A schedule and then B shut, right?
And so that position is a wildly inefficient position because that person no longer has the skill set to do this new thing.
40:22
You have to have somebody who's really an outbound salesperson to work the leads and work them hard and be heavily incentivized because it's not fun work to get someone to do it.
And so based on what we see, we've been able to cut the manual labor associated with getting the leads to show, which is actually higher than the cost of the lead itself.
40:41
So people are spending 99 to $150.00 in manual labor to work their leads compared to their $10 lead.
So even if you get one out of five leads in the door and you cost $10 leads, that's $50 in ad spend, but it cost you $150.00 in labor to get them to show.
40:59
It's what we do is we have a performance based business because I'm a big performance guy, how good we are.
And so we get on average twice as many leads to show.
On average, our top 20% are three or four times the average, which means for every dollar you spend, if you're concerned with your lead costs and getting more people in the door, if you can get changing this, one piece of the pipeline could 3 or 4X the amount of customers you see per month simply by working the shit out of the lead the right way.
41:30
And that's not dialing 100 times a day.
It's messaging that's been split tested 100 times to get the highest engagement rates and response rates.
And if you don't have a franchise or that's that's that's compiling all that data from all of their franchisees, you don't have enough data to actually split test it well yourself based on your one launch or a couple locations that you're running.
41:54
How do they find you?
Like, I mean finish that and I want, I want to, you know, share with the audience where they can find you as well.
You just go to use allen.com.
That's the, that's the, the URL.
If you want to go there, go around and opt in for stuff.
But that's that's that's how we do it.
If you're a gym, ULX is are done for your acquisition system.
42:12
So we just for the first time ever basically you're doing all demand gents.
So we're marketing and working the leads and so our clients only pay us for human beings who walk in the door or pick up a phone call for an appointment depending on the type of businesses and that's it.
42:28
That's all.
So that way you're not paying a retainer.
You're not, there's no risk.
It's just if you know that a client is worth $500, are you willing to pay the cost of the ad plus 40 bucks or 50 bucks, whatever.
It is a little bit different for industry to get that person on the phone, which costs you 1/3 of what it would cost to pay someone else.
42:45
And none of the management, none of the HR, none of the hiring and firing that you have, That's our value profit.
It's been growing a lot.




0:00
What's going on, everybody?
I'm bringing some more books, but I wanted to say that, if you haven't checked out Hunter million-dollar offers, I would definitely suggest that you start there.

On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
The audiobook is Lowe's, they'll let me put it on for it.
So I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast and I'm saying, And if this affects you, I'm purposely doing it this way because I am not going to help you unless unless we break some beliefs, all right?
0:38
And that's what has to happen.
Welcome to the gym Secrets podcast, we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on everyone?
0:53
Happy Wednesday, hope you guys are having a smashing made of week saw bunch of sales coming through.
So good on that.
I want to tell you a story that will hopefully break some of your beliefs and I think will be one of the reasons that you like if you can internalize the story, this may be the way that you get to eight figures or seven figures.
1:09
If that is your goal when I started in the information marketing agency World Layla and I were dating At that time, I had six gems that I was that I owned.
I had gym launch which was a done-for-you sales and marketing system where we fly out and launch of the people's Jim's.
1:32
And I had a dentist agency where I would generate leads for dentists and I had a chiropractic agency where I generated leads for chiropractors and guess what?
I need no money.
1:48
The reason I made no money is because I could not focus on anything.
And so what happened there was I developed an initial set of skills sales and marketing and then immediately saw this whole new world of opportunity that is in front of it.
But what I had not developed yet was the character trait to associate with the skill, which was disciplined in focus.
2:10
And because of that, my lack of character, I was not able to reap the rewards or the fruits.
Of the skill set that I had Acquired.
And so, what ended up happening was probably one of the hardest year and a half's of my life, all right?
I ended up having I sold five of the six gyms.
2:27
I'd shut one of them down a partner stole, all the money from the sale of those gyms.
I had the gym launch that started happening was working and then all of a sudden we had charged back from my one of the gyms that I shut down, which then wiped that account clean again.
All right.
The dentist that I sold did not get results because I did not have a system for Put together, I just generated leads on a sheet and just told them on calls what they needed to do.
2:50
And they didn't do it obviously.
And so I had to dentists that had pay me ten thousand dollars each.
I had chiropractors that had paid me ten thousand dollars and all that was left is that all of the money that I use that I've gotten from, that was literally just to pay my bills and eat and do whatever.
3:07
All right, and the issue was that I had no Focus as soon as I see an entrepreneur that comes into my world and they say, I have a couple of companies.
I immediately know that they are Anup that they are a nuke.
And some of you may be hearing this right now and be like, well, I have a couple of companies.
3:25
Cool, you're probably a new.
All right, it's very unlikely that you have the ability at this point to have multiple entities.
All right?
Like I'm telling you this right now and so the issue is there are five stages that you go through when you are a new.
3:44
All right?
And I'm saying this and if Affects you.
I'm purposely doing it this way because I am not going to help you unless unless we break some beliefs, all right?
And that's what has to happen and for some reason, fuck, I'll just make another sheet.
All right, here's the five stages.
4:01
You've got one, you got a little up, you got it down and then you go up higher at the end.
All right.
One in the beginning is called uninformed optimism.
That means you are optimistic about something that's going to happen.
You're excited about the opportunity.
That's in front of you because you see, with your Your skillset.
4:17
You imagine how much money you can make?
And you start doing this math in your head and you put it on Excel sheet and you get Excel rich and you sell yourself and you talk to your partner, you talk to your parents, you talk to your friends and all you do is get excited right in your dopamine starts crying.
No.
Oh my God, this is going to be amazing to make so much money, right?
4:33
Then what happens, you get into it and then you go to here, right?
And right here is called, informed pessimism.
You now know that it's not as good as you thought because now you have more information you find out That just like every other Niche, there's going to be issues, there's going to be constraints, there's going to be problems, right?
4:51
Because guess what, they all have problems.
And then you go to here.
This is called the valley of Despair.
This is where you're in the thick of it.
You can't figure it out or like you're figuring out.
There's tons of hair all over it.
And so, what do you do?
You jump.
To the next Niche and you start all over again.
5:11
And you do the dance, you say uninformed optimism informed pessimism Valley of Despair and you never make it past.
Step 3.
Step 3 is where you have to go through the ship, right?
And the only way to get through the shit is to focus.
5:29
When you keep going into new niches, you never put your roots deep enough to learn the game, right?
There's a reason it's not Kyra launched, you know, Oh Dental launch and you know, PT launch and whatever lunch.
Right.
There's a reason that we chose not to do that because you can have a 100 million dollar Dental agency, you can have a hundred million dollar Cairo actions.
5:52
You have a hundred million dollar PT agency, what you probably can't have is three of them and so you have to ask yourself what is the reason that I think I need to do more niches?
What's the reason is it?
Because I think that's going to make me more money.
No.
Why Why would it make you more money?
6:09
Because wouldn't it be easier to just get more of the customers you already have?
And can demonstrate results for, right?
It's so the next two steps of this are now.
Informed optimism is Step 4.
What that means is at this point, you've gone through the shit and you figured out the solution, right?
6:29
And it's starting to work and he's starting to get into a rhythm and then all the way up here at number five is achievement, all right?
And that is where you realize that Potential of this new opportunity.
Most people never make it past here ever.
And depending on the entrepreneur, they can continue to repeat this cycle for years years and they cannot figure it out.
6:56
It's like the guy that you know who continues to date the same girl.
Identical different chick every time but it's the same chick, right?
And they keep going and to keep doing the same mistake.
Really fall in love.
They get really excited and they actually realize they have to relationship and they bail, right?
7:12
And they do the same thing over and over.
Getting never get to the part where they can achieve the potential of the relationship.
It's the same thing in business and until you learn the skill, you will never get to eight figures.
I'm telling you this right now, it has everything to do what's going on in your head, you have to go through the shit and you have to figure out the stuff that they aren't figuring out every problem that you encounter instead of running away from it, which is exactly what Niche hopping is.
7:38
Actly.
What new opportunity hopping is, you have to confront it, you have to face it head-on and you have to figure it out, right?
If they can't, sell over the phone, you have to figure it out.
You have to make a better script.
You have to make a better training, you have to do, dearly calls with them, you have to drill team train their team.
7:53
You have to think how many ways can I solve this problem, right?
If they're not making enough money, it's because you did not create a mousetrap that was valuable enough for them to extract value from.
And whose fault is that it's yours, right?
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
8:12
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that, you mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
8:34
And so, just like I'm putting this out there because the number one thing I'm seeing right now.
And if guys were on my, on my presentation yesterday, the third, the third framework that I introduced was the Knicks.
Duplication framework, which is how you can repeat this in as many niches as possible.
And I put that in there because I know who I'm talking to right in their minds.
8:54
The any experience mind they think, oh my God, if I made ten thousand dollars in one Niche I could do ten thousand dollars in another dish because they don't even have the belief yet that you can make a million dollars.
A month in an inch, you can make 10 million dollars a month in an inch, right?
You just have to have that belief.
Alright, and so, getting to another Niche, tell me what problem, it solves to double your operational issues, double the types, and number of problems that you have to solve in real time, tell me how that's going to make your life easier.
9:22
Explain it to me making argument to me, right?
Because if the question is, I don't, you know, my mind into supersaturated.
Welcome to the fucking world, right?
It's all saturated 100% of its saturated, right?
Only way to win is to be better and the way to be better is to stick through the ship.
9:38
It's to go through the third step, where everyone bails, right?
And on the other side of that is where all of the green grasses.
The green grass is not only other Niche.
It's not on the other side of the fence.
It's not in the new opportunity.
It's going through going through the manure and digging down and then letting it grow, right?
9:55
You gotta work the field.
That's how it works.
All right?
I'm telling you this because I lived it.
All right, I had six gems one done for uh, Agency and then I had three niches I would serve it.
It was impossible.
Same guy.
All right, six months later, I cut everything out and just said I'm going all in on Jim's and why did I do that?
10:14
Because my wife was like if you don't pick something she's like I'm not going to be with you.
And I was like, fuck?
All right?
And so maybe some of you need someone maybe you don't have a covers gonna be that.
Maybe she has no idea whatever.
Right.
And so hopefully this can just be a voice to you from your past, all right?
10:32
Because I feel like as I'm talking Um you guys I just feel like I'm talking to myself, right?
And so I don't want you to make this mistake and some of you will keep going around this Merry-Go-Round over and over and over and over again.
And you will not beat the level until you learn how to unlock the boss, right?
10:50
And to put him on his ass and the way to put them on his ass is not to do more different things is to do, more of the same thing.
It's to get better and every entrepreneur wants something that's new, the marketplace wants new, but the business World wants.
It's better.
And that's how you win, right?
11:06
There's no shortcut.
And so you have to put in the work, you have to run beta tests, right?
You gotta say, okay, we're going to try this new script.
We're going to take four of our facilities and have them test this new script out.
You're going to make a little training for them present, it get them to give you stats every day and focus on it.
11:22
And then what happens if it improves, great roll it out to everyone, if it doesn't improve learn from it, try something else.
Right?
And like, the reason Jim launch Gruta way it was, is because every single step of the process, we tested And tested and tested, right?
Even in this online model that we've been pushing right now, right?
11:39
We have, we've already changed and tweaked and improved each part of that process.
I like, it wasn't like, all right, let's do chiropractors.
You know, what gyms gyms aren't working, right?
Gin joint work with us.
To chiropractors know, right?
We just stick through the shit.
And so I say this with, like, a lot of love and I'm trying to say this because some of you guys, I feel like I could be a big brother to like, like going to give you like a new, you sometime.
12:04
I'm saying this with love because I need you to get through this and you get through this like prepubescent phase of noob entrepreneurship of, I want to do everything.
You got to pick one, you can win at any of them, but you can't win it all of them.
And that's, that's the reason, right?
So many you have so much skill, right?
12:21
You guys are so good at promoting, you're so good at selling, right?
So we got a great marketers, you just have to use that and channel it into one channel.
Otherwise your spread too thin and that's why you feel like you're working all day, you're putting out fires all day and you can't move.
Or right if you imagine right now if all you had to do is get one person to be successful and then all you do is duplicate that one person and just clone them and do it again and do it again and do it again.
12:45
And I'll tell you.
Like, right now, we're learning on the agency side how to make you guys successful.
One of the mistakes that I made early on like with Alan right now is that in the beginning, a lot of the messaging that I have.
When I talk to me, you guys who's that?
Alan is a platform that you can run your Agency on and make more money in reality, Alan it.
13:04
Alan is a platform that supports the business model that I'm telling, right?
It's more switch to my model and you will make more.
We just so happen to use our to extract the value.
It is a piece, but the model is the thing that's going to make you the money, right?
13:19
That's the game.
And so some of you are not following instructions, you're half in your half out.
You're like, I want to do half the things one way and half things in other ways.
Not going to work, right?
It's like the girl who's trying to lose weight.
She's like woman to do keto on Monday, Wednesday, Friday.
And we do high carb, you know, Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, you can't mix shit.
13:37
Doesn't work that way, right?
Gotta follow the sequence, the guys who are doing the best or just following the play, right?
Are following the plane.
Some of you guys got slaughtered fucking egos right.
You're not hot shit.
Myself included, right?
But I'm saying like like I don't know how like and I'm just so you guys know.
13:54
Well I'll leave their.
I'm going to reach out to a couple you guys but you have to just So I want you guys to win and I don't want you to make the same mistakes, I did, and I want you to level up and the way to level up is not by doing more things, just by doing the same thing better.
And it's not sexy.
14:11
And that's the character trait, you have to develop to get to the next level.
So anyways, I hope that made sense for some you guys if maybe you made sense front of you, hopefully make sense for one of you guys.
And hopefully, that's a turning point that you can say, you know what, I'm not going to do six inches, I'm going to pick one and I'm gonna get really good at and that's what I'm doing.
14:27
When it gets hard, I'm going to stick with it because I know that The other person who's gone and tried this Niche gets to this point in Bales, and that's why they can't move forward.
They all do a mediocre job and then try and spread themselves too thin.
But I'm not going to do that.
I'm going to be better than them because I'm going to win, and I'm going to get through this piece because what it took to get you to here, which is learning how to sell.
14:47
And promote is not the thing that's going to get you to their which is learning to be disciplined with your focus with your attention.
All right.
So anyways, I hope that made sense if you guys could do me a favor and like this.
So that would be seized it in the group than People know that it's important which it is Sonia.
15:03
Just wanted to throw that out there.
Make sure that you don't stop at step.
Three, get all the way up to realizing your potential and stop leaving the valued of Despair and jumping to another opportunity where it says uninformed optimism.
You just think it's great because you don't know it won't just like every new grow.
You start dating think, this one's not going to be crazy.
15:20
Find out they're all things right?
Same thing with your clients.
All right, everyone's crazy just got to dig through the shit and then you find the diamonds.
All right.
Lots of guys.
Hope you guys are having a good.
Weak and mean seems like the sales numbers are doing great PS.
The reason we use clickfunnels in our businesses in yours, right?
15:37
Or using funnels, in general, not clickfunnels specifically.
We click funnels in general this because lead quality is higher and they make more money.
So if you make a client's more money, you will make more money to all the guys who are doing the best with all the numbers reason funnels.
Just FYI catch you guys soon.
Oh, make sure they keep their availability because otherwise nothing








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
Welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
0:41
So quick thing that just came up recently, I was asked to explain, what are the ways to increase lead quality?
And so there are five ways that you can increase lead quality.
And so this is if you were like, man, my knees are weak or I want my leads to be higher quality or people are complaining to you whatever.
0:59
Never right, there's five ways to do this.
Now, that being said, the monetization structure behind it, you're going to want to play with these variables so that you can optimize your throughput so you can get the most amount of sales or much money.
Cash upfront, depending on whatever it is that you're optimizing for.
All right?
So it's not to say that you should do all five of these things because sometimes you are going to be leaving a lot of money on the table because ultimately you want to remove as few of these are sorry as many of these as you can because they're all bottlenecks on the amount of volume you're going to get and so each of these will increase quality but typically decrease volume and These are the trade-offs that you'll do in the marketing side that you.
1:32
These are the variables that you'll play with, in order to get the, the optimal setup for, for sales.
All right.
So that further Ado, the five ways that you can increase lead quality.
Number one, you're targeting are so they're targeting.
You can do this in a couple of ways.
1:48
One is you can just do it by ZIP code other.
You can do it by by income level or profession.
Those are all things that you can do to immediately increase lead quality.
If you go to only the rich zip codes, you're going to have, you know, higher any leads in general, right?
That being said, if you're doing those zip codes, just understand that other people are also marking the zip codes.
2:06
And they will probably also be more expensive and your volume would be lower.
So, there's number one is the Target, right?
Number two, is the number of steps that they have to jump through, right?
If someone has to do 10 steps, in order to get on the phone, with you versus One, Step, they're going to be more qualified because they took more action.
So, they're more in pain and they're more likely to want to work with you, right?
2:25
Or they were more compelled by the offer headlines, etcetera.
So that will increase the lead quality.
Well, number two is getting started with three, excuse me, is the the nature of the offer, all right, so free offers is a paid offer or a free amazing giveaway.
Compared to a click here to schedule a sales call is going to create a very different type of prospect, right?
2:44
Not All Leads are created equal and so if you are having someone opt-in for a giveaway, you will have more volume by a ton.
And so that's where there's so much emphasis on the monetization structure behind it in The Mousetrap that you built in order to like, if You have a giveaway there.
3:00
I've no playing people in Industry that you give away some crush it because they have a good mousetrap behind it and they take advantage of the point.
But if you don't do a giveaway and you do a straight to call, then that person is going to be more qualified than somebody who is opting in for just like a giveaway or whatever, right?
The fourth is going to be an application, right?
3:17
So if you have application is sort of the same thing as having a step but it's different enough that I figured it was worth mentioning so you can have like four pages in a row that only require one chat box or you can have one page that has a lot of questions on Right?
And so and the nature of the applications have lots of paragraph.
3:33
Question answers is going to be more work and therefore a higher quality lead compared to lots of checkboxes and ABC, right type questions and answers for the application.
So that's another thing that you can do to implement to increase the quality of the leads that are coming through.
Simply adding an application before they have access to, you will increase accordingly and you can also there's a lot of psychology behind the questions that you're asking the application.
3:55
So getting them to State their goal, getting them to state that they have a problem getting To understand what their biggest unknowns are than the things that they're struggling with understanding that, you know, setting the precedent that there is going to be an expense, are they willing to invest in, you know, in a solution for their problem?
And if you want to and have big balls, which I would encourage you to do, put some sort of minimum amount.
4:15
If you're, if you're if you're things, you know, let's say your things a thousand bucks.
Say hey, are you willing to spend at least five hundred dollars on the thing?
It doesn't mean it has to be that but at least it gets them in the ballpark around where you're going to be right.
Hey guys, love that you're listening to the podcast.
4:30
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects more visuals, more graphs, you don't drawn out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, And then, finally, the fifth thing that you can do to increase the quality of the leads is provide Value First.
4:54
Alright, so this is gonna be the actual content of the advertisement itself and the video itself.
So if you have a video that's incredibly compelling but doesn't necessarily explain anything or add value to the consumer, then you might get lots of leaves with the quality of might not as be as High versus a video that might be five minutes long and provides a tremendous amount of value, tactical importance of they can immediately Implement their lives.
5:18
Then that person might be more qualified if they come in because they're like you, this person is already provided me value.
I already know that they're good at what they do and so it gives you a more authoritative positioning in the prospects mind so that they will be more likely to give you money.
5:35
All right?
So, there's lots of ways to increase quality of the lead, the the trade-off, and where you have to come in as a business owner.
Not just a marketer is understanding how you our business model Works behind it.
My two cents on this is that I try and Start with the biggest widest net as possible and then work backwards.
5:52
And what I mean is I just want to get flow once I get flow that I'm going to try and create a series of offers and upsells on that flow that will allow me to make more money on the customer because the worst thing in the world is not having any flow to begin with and so I would rather start with a much wider net and then create a series of offers and indoctrination sequences and pre frames that.
6:13
After I get the flow will get someone to give us more money and typically If you are good, about your sales, engineering and choreography behind the behind the opt-in behind the application, behind the call, that's the model itself, then you should know what your numbers are on.
6:29
Let's say a free trial or somebody who downloads a lead Magnet or whatever it may be.
You should know that for every one dollar put in here at day 15.
I'm at one dollar a day 30.
I'm at three and a half dollars a day, 60, M at seven dollars.
If you don't have those numbers, it will be much more difficult to make decisions about your marketing without that.
6:48
And so, all that being said, the time to use these 5 increasing and quality type applications is when you have so much volume and the quality of the prospects is so low that you are willing to sacrifice half the throughput or third of the throughput on the advertising to either get higher higher ticket or to accommodate for your operational capacity, right?
7:15
If I can get, let's say I'm booking some sort of national Pain and I'm going straight to call if my team can't handle as many and I don't mind doubling my lead cost to get to put a fence up, because I can't even handle the flow that's coming in.
7:31
Then that instance, it would be worth it for me to double Miley costs because it's the matter is, as much to me and I can't handle the operational flow.
But for me, personally, I tend to start with the biggest net and then try and see what I can do in the back and put the onus or the responsibility on the model and the monetization structures in the Sequence so that I can afford whatever I want and then ultimately have a high volume High ticket sale or mid ticket sale type business and we've rinse and repeat that exact same model in brick-and-mortar.
8:01
For the Jim, we've done it for the supplement company, we've done it for Jim launch, we've done it for now the online, the online fitness model that we are getting all of our you know, seven-figure gym owners to walk away from and go into because they're simply making more money, they're able to get the same average price.
8:18
Point on these clients, as they were before, except they're able to get an unlimited lead flow, and the average cost per lead is about a fifth, right?
And so as long as we can make the machine behind it work, which took us three or four iterations to get it really tweaked and continue to do.
So, put the onus on the model rather than, on the marketing and typically, you'll make more money.
8:38
That's just been my personal experience and I hopefully that provides value for you.
So otherwise, hope you have a mazing Thursday.
I hope they give you five different ways.
You can increase the quality if you need it.
Many times.
Do you see to look behind the lie at the monetization system that they're coming into to make sure that you can afford the traffic rather than trying to tweak the front end?
8:57
So maybe it was giving you an answer without giving you an answer or giving you the five things even though you might not actually need that, it's usually the model itself.
But if you do have an issue, having too much traffic, and the people aren't qualified and you're willing to increase how much you pay per show for you don't have the operational capacity then adding 1 2 3 4 5 these qualifiers in.
9:17
It's an easy and fast.
Fast and reliable way to increase the quality of belief, man.








0:00
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however, you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there.
For another entrepreneur point is, is that they would get people to just agree that they don't want anything.
Else welcome to the gym Secrets podcast.
We talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons that we have learned along the way.
0:39
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on, everyone?
Happy Saturday.
I want to give you a quick and tactical training.
This is one of my favorite stories of all time from selling stuff and this comes from the V of Richard Schwartz and Menos torts furriers there.
0:59
A fourth generation Furrier in Baltimore and they took over the entire Market.
Really the larger like, Maryland, Pennsylvania Market just simply doing the boring work and being better at the everyday things and So Richard Schwartz unknowing, unbeknownst to him was a mentor of mine in terms of.
1:17
I just observed a lot of the things that he did in his business and I start doing back of napkin math when I was 17 or 18 and I was like dude this guy Cahill's it and you w and I probably stole it and there was one is its I learned so many things from him but one of them was getting people to say no to say yes.
1:38
Alright and so this is a very very real world Tactical.
Tidbit that you can use to close sales.
Now, there's a specific type of cell that this really applies to, which is a lot of times bolt on or, or up sells, right?
And these upsells can be incredibly important to the business in terms of driving, bottom line, profit liquidating, acquisition costs.
2:00
And so usually these are sales that are not complex sales.
These are not necessarily core offer sales, these are sales you know within the Finish world that might be attributed to supplement sales or meal sales or if In retail, if you like getting someone to buy a scarf with the outfit or just, you know, anything along those lines, you know, getting someone to buy Orthotics if you're in the, in the physical therapy space or fewer, the dental space, getting by a special kind of extra brace or special toothpaste or whatever.
2:28
Or, if you're the beauty space, you know, night serums that go with your service package, whatever it is, right?
The point is, is that usually there's going to be, you know, one or multiple things you're going to want to go with your core offer, right?
The reason that this, this little trick I learned, I learned from him is so powerful that it closes like crazy, all right?
2:46
So if you're used to having like 20 30 % of people take up cells, that is a normal amount where people take up cells and the reason he gets 90% plus to take is up cells because they don't know they're being sold.
All right?
And so here's the trick, and here's how it works.
And, I mean, you can take this to the bank, like it works, okay.
3:03
And I'll give you the example that they used at Man O.
And so, somebody will come in.
And so every year, if you bought a fur coat, you would Have to store it, right?
And they made they killed in those storage, but anyways, so people would come in.
So, basically, they sell someone a car essentially, because that's how much, you know, for Kota is, they sell someone a car and then, every year, they would maintain that customer relationship by getting them to come back in and store their coat during the summer.
3:28
Because it's not good to, you know, keep really expensive fur in, you know, the Heat or whatever.
Right.
That's at least part of the picture.
And so they, everybody brings their for in to get stored and condition.
So they brush them, you know, and I was one of the guys.
Who's brushing them in the warehouse and like spraying these things down.
3:46
It was mind-numbing work, but I got to learn a lot while I was there.
And so you know, we brush these coats and so one of the one of the things, one of the promotion's you read as it said, it was get a free pair of for earmuffs when you store your coat for.
4:03
Winter are so your course.
Um excuse me.
Hey guys real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans, I love I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 leads but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
4:26
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads its fo free in exchange for email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller leads and so that you can not miss out on it because last time I sold out for like eight straight weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
4:44
And so tons of people come in because they wanted these true real fur, earmuffs by bringing it in.
And so what would end up happening is David his son?
Would the person would come in and they say, I want to I want to do this and can I get the for free motion?
5:01
So he would show them the Fourier.
Bluffs.
And then say, well you're like what we're going to do is store and condition your coat.
You don't want anything else do you and they would say no.
I don't want anything else for the conditioning wasn't upset, right?
5:16
And it's almost even the way I presented it to just now it's like what you're going to store in the condition code but storing the code versus touring and doing the brush down and doing the the shampooing, if the coat is obviously an extra service, but it immediately added a couple hundred bucks to every single coat and they were doing thousands of coats, right?
5:34
And so anyhow the point is is that they would get people to just agree that they don't want anything else, okay?
So think about Out how you can use this strategy, right?
There's there's many ways you can use it, but the something else is the easiest that I can ever see, right?
5:51
So let's say you say, hey like this is what you're going to, this is what you need to take for this weight loss program, right?
These are the four supplements you need to take now, you might have more supplements, right?
And you're like, you don't want to buy anything else to you, right?
And then they're going to automatically lot of times like you do want to buy any more stuff to you and then they're like, no, no, no, I don't need anything else, right?
6:09
And by doing that, you automatically close the sale that you just recommend it.
Right.
And you can do the same thing in a different way, which would be like, Hey, you don't want to pay full retail for that, right?
And they're going to be like, no, no, no.
I don't want to, it's like cool.
6:24
So you want me to send it with this discount to the even be a dress, I have on file, it'll be like, okay.
Yeah, let's do that.
Right?
And so by doing that, you're getting them to say yes by saying, no.
And the thing is, people are so contrary and people always feel like they're being sold that you're actually use that psychological, like, it's subconscious.
6:43
Like they can't even think they're not even making the thought process like they're agreeing because they're so pre-programmed to try not.
To buy things that they end up buying things and to use that psychological bias to your advantage.
So, one of the most powerful techniques I've ever seen in sales, most people get 20 to 30% uptake on their upsells.
7:02
If you use an assumed close tactic like this, you can literally see 90% plus take rates on this, right?
And so, as a to wrap up, the story, when they give them the earmuffs at the Fourier, they would Would they would say.
7:20
Well now that you have those you're going to need to store those in condition those as well.
So that will be next year or whatever.
And so ended up happening is that people would get the, the free the free earmuffs.
But you have to pay to get it sort of conditions, which would cover the cost of her.
So it's just kind of a Larry, is because what happens you give it to them.
7:39
They have it in their hand to be like, well, you still need to store it because you just bought your code here and you're not going to keep these out.
So to be to be congruent with the story of needing store, the coast they had to wrap it.
Right underneath the jacket, and they were take both of them in the back.
And so people would come in, they get the earmuffs, they hold onto them and they put them right back on the code and say, hey you don't want us to do anything else besides, you know, story and conditioning do and they're like, no, no anything else like, okay, cool.
8:02
Well, let's we'll get that taken care of and then they expect to go real fast.
Like want to secure the buttons, kind of lose want us to.
So this little seam here that guy.
Yeah.
Sure.
You want to think I'll see you.
Right?
No no.
And so every time before these things they say is a lie back but people are so surprised really wired to try and say no to All's that they would say yes by saying.
8:22
No.
And so you can try and utilize that in your business.
I think it works very well with kind of like hand-to-hand small up cells, but a lot of these little, small offsets can be massive profit drivers in the business.
This is kind of like your fries and coke situation that I'm talking about here.
8:37
Like this is a lot like you don't make your money on the burger, you make your money on the fries and a coke because there's the high profit margin things.
Even though it's not the core offer and a lot of times there's huge pockets of profit that most especially most small business owners and especially be running like a Brick and mortar be service business that you're missing out on.
8:53
So, highly recommend using that strategy.
If you're like man, I wish I could use in my business, you can just use your brain and be creative because winners, always think, man.
I wonder how I could use that in my business and losers think that wouldn't work in my business.
My business is different, so decide which one you are and then execute cordially.
9:11
Otherwise, lots of love of you guys are going to be using Saturday, but that was value for you if it is, you know, dropper tag or like or do all the fun stuff and Hope to see you on the next podcast.
All right, get soon back.
Hope to see you on the next podcast.
All right, get soon back.

Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
I flipped The Narrative of the story from like some some Hood upstairs.
There's, you know, five individual rooms right.
Which literally had barbells in the middle of them to to this Swanky secret.
0:43
Almost like many secret society, like Transformation Center that only celebrities and politicians that go to purposely off the beaten path, so that they can maintain their discretion, welcome to the gym.
Seekers podcast, we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures.
1:00
Some lessons that we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Good morning, happy Wednesday.
I'll make this a short one.
It was something that came to mind yesterday and it's about the story behind the story.
1:16
And so, one of the things that I think has been really powerful, maybe even the one of the most powerful things that separates really good salesman from everyone else is their level of conviction.
Now, the question is, how can we get that level of conviction and do it repeatably in other people?
1:34
And the first person's to Do it is yourself.
And so, what I want to kind of give you is one example of how to use this kind of strategy and how kind of important is so in Dan Kennedy's, I think it's, it's book called I think it's like XXX selling or something like that.
1:50
So he partnered with a woman who ran a brothel like a prostitute business on how to sell and I've read the entire book and and there's a lot of really very Tactical Good nuggets in there.
The most valuable thing that I can say that I got from the book was the concept of congruence throughout the sales process and so the choreography of the customer experience that their experience should match the expectation of the perception of what the business wanted to communicate.
2:26
So what I mean by that is does every part of your sales process, the tonality of the person, the first email that get the wording that all of these pieces.
Has, does it align with a truly world-class business, right?
And so they took a ton of care in this is like a New York brothel to make it feel like this this call service was truly top-notch.
2:50
The woman on the phone were British.
They had this you know so they could sound like you know, Rich Butler's all that kind of stuff and whatever the term is for a female Butler.
But you get my point.
So the canoe so, you know, like whatever.
And you know, what type of woman would you like?
And I mean, you may be I swear that I get it, but from a sales perspective, understanding how they greeted people, how they had the experience, how they did the follow-up, all of that fit within the prospects mind and she talked about how if for some reason.
3:18
Any one part of that story was not aligned with the true imagination of what they had created and depicted in the prospects mind, they would pop and then all of a sudden they would just like be a whore house, right?
3:35
And So that's kind of the difference with the positioning here and so an easy example of this are like a real life for me was when I was selling the very first or second gym that I was telling Jim launched at and this is when I was flying out and doing the sales I had been told by the owner that this place was going to be a mean.
3:55
He said bougie, it's going to be just like unbelievable.
It's going to reek of money.
Those are the exact words you used.
It's always like, oh, this is gonna be great on the fly out and we do a ton of high-ticket sales, it's gonna be awesome.
It's when I get Got there.
Some of you guys have seen my video of selling 191 people in the hood, it was that Jim and it wasn't even a gym.
4:14
It was an upstairs apartment that had that he rented to apartment side by side and it was like, had like a kitchen and like bedrooms, and it was just who's just not at all an actual like.
Anyways, the point being wasn't a gym.
4:30
It was literally, you know, five individual rooms into different apartments.
And there was bars on the windows and you know, those creaky really dirty steps.
There's like, you know, the corner market right down the street just like, you know what I mean?
It was not at all.
4:46
What was being depicted to me?
And so the challenge was, how am I going to overcome the story that people are seeing with their eyes and tell them a new narrative?
And so, the narrative that I came up with and it was in d.c. is I would say, okay, we're because things aren't that far apart.
5:03
So I so I told people is like Oh yes, I can.
These individual rooms are like, have you ever been to?
You know, it's like when you first start working out, you want that privacy, right?
I was like, yeah, you don't want other people staring at you when you're, when you're starting out.
Right?
And I'm like, oh my God.
Yeah.
And I'm like right and so a lot of our clients really appreciate the Privacy that we offer them because we have a lot of, you know, people who prefer to keep their identity secret.
5:25
And so they just get off, you know, get off the subway.
It's not in the in the main areas and this is where we really do with people who are high-class, you know, who are very important.
And so that's Why we have the structure that way.
It's really to cater to that type of clientele.
Hey, Mose, an Asian quick break, just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
5:46
All right, so send me a connection request a note.
Let me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or Layla's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
And I would tell that story just like I just did and all of a sudden people were attracted to wanting to be part of this new thing that was off the beaten path.
6:10
That how would that was upstairs in this building?
I was like we're purposely discrete that's part of how we do things.
We don't want to be out there and in the public, we are the place that people go to that.
They don't want other people to know that they're coming and doing those big Transformations.
Like we're that off the beaten path and we value the the privacy of our clients and when I like so it's can you hear I'm doing this?
6:30
Is that?
I flip The Narrative of the story from like some some Hood upstairs, you know, five individual rooms right?
Which literally had barbells in the middle of them to to this Swanky secret.
6:48
Almost like many secret society like Transformation Center that only celebrities and politicians would go to purposely off the beaten path so that they could maintain their discretion, right?
And so that is the story.
Worry behind the story, right?
7:03
Obviously you have to do your sales process the same way you normally would.
But the thing is, is that I because it was useful for me, he told me that's what was going to happen.
And so I Incorporated that into my belief system and I was convicted when I was explaining the story about what we were trying to do and by doing that, we were able to close a way higher percentage cetera and I mean we crushed it.
7:27
And so what you can do from that is First, ask yourself the story behind the story, right?
Like what type of company are you, right?
And if you can be convicted in saying that we are world class, and the big problem here is that many people aren't convicted.
7:45
They think they say, I want to help 10,000 people.
I want to change because I have, but they're not really convicted about being the best, right?
And so do the things to get your conviction.
Because once you have that conviction, you can tell someone the story behind the story, and they can feel the air between your words.
8:01
And the sentiment that's being communicated.
And I think it's incredibly powerful and a sales setting, especially because we're always just telling stories.
And if you can create a story of the type of business that you are, then it will be.
Hopefully something that the person that you're talking to wants to associate with and it gives you a much much stronger to tractor and it can help you overcome some smaller things.
8:24
And so anything that you have that could be perceived as negative, you have a story that you can flip, right?
To use in Reverse or that story to explain it away and even position yourself in a better way as a result of that.
And so right now that's I mean I just I'm trying to trying to communicate this in the best way possible like that story that you anchor yourself with is going to be the thing that gives you the conviction that can close so many sales for you.
8:54
And also if you're like if you've sold your sales person who's new on the fact that like you're this type of poop, Please sir.
Like think about some of these new comes in and you're there like they don't know who you are and those first moments are so important because you're like no, no, like we are world class.
9:13
Let me show you why we are positioned this way.
We're not just saying that we are, and if you can get that conviction they will speak with a different are two prospects.
Think about how the salesman at Gucci or Prada or Chanel or any of these really, really top-tier Brands talks To a prospect, they have the weight of brand behind them and they like, some people like, man, they were kind of up being there.
9:37
It's like, well, they're trying to ward off a certain type of people, and attract a different type of person that values exclusivity and Supremacy.
Not the right word because it's all politically, whatever.
But like elitism, right?
9:53
They're trying to attract people who want that, right?
And so, the salesman has the weight of the brand behind them and the brand is the story.
And so if you can create the Brand Story, that you sell yourself on first and then can sell your salespeople on, you will be able to sell more people and they will be more brought in as long as the entire process is choreographed to reinforce that story.
10:17
So that's the story behind the story.
If you don't know what your story is, it's being made for you and it's probably not the one you want told.
And so I highly recommend getting that straight.
Making sure the sales guys and girls and yourself included.
Know what that story is.
So that everything they do is in alignment with that.
10:31
So that everything they do is in alignment with that.








0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually a pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
Welcome back to the gym Secrets podcast this week, we're listening into an episode that actually aired in March of 2018, but don't let that throw you.
It's just as relevant today, as it was, then enjoy.
Hey, what's going on everyone?
0:32
Happy happy hump day.
I wanted to make a another little video for you because it was on my mind.
I thought I was I was telling someone else about the story and I figured I might as well share with you guys.
So, so some of you guys might know we were just at the phone hacking live event.
0:48
We were some of the speakers were talking about high ticket sales and you know, we won one of the awards which is like it's called the ax award which is means you did over 10 million in sales.
Pretty cool.
I mean, we were excited about it but I mean, it's awesome.
1:06
But the thing that happened afterwards is where I kind of want to bring the lesson home.
So I had a couple people after we, you know, spoke and we were kind of showcased as kind of a success story type thing, we're like, hey, you know, could you consult for my business?
I'd like to do something like this in my space, and chiropractors dentists or ball wobble.
1:23
All right.
And people offer to pay us. 50,000 for a single day, it to people come up and offer that for us to kind of Coach them on their business, help them scale, help them start, doing our ticket, whatever, right?
And my wife before I even had a chance to answer the question step forward and said, no, we don't do that.
1:46
And I wanted to kind of highlight why it was important and why why that kind of attitude has helped us grow so fast.
And so what happens is, Is you you know continue to scale and continue to make more money continue have stuff that works.
2:01
Is that the better?
You are the better the opportunities that you have to say, no to our.
And so what happens is specially as entrepreneurs, a lot of times we see things that were like, man, this would be so cool.
I got like six businesses and like don't really make money but like I'm like, I don't know which one I'm going to do, but I'm gonna invest in all of them and like, imma see which one takes off.
2:18
But like that's fundamentally flawed because you as an honest broker make any business take off and any single business can be as big as you want it to be.
And so all you're doing when you're diluting your Soon as you're diluting your attention and then ultimately you're ensuring that none of them will work, right?
And so we turn down these 250 thousand dollar a day Consulting clients because the attention that that would take is going to take more from our business, then it will give us and making decisions in that way as been probably.
2:46
The number one thing that has grown as to where we are.
Now I can't tell you the amount of guys who I think then we are and it's because they can't focus.
Like they cannot focus, that can't stick to one.
Thing they do launch after lunch, they switch product is just Industries.
They switch customer avatars, like last thing about doing this Talisman this and they just can't stick with it, right?
3:07
And if you look at our business, right?
And if you look at our gym model, and then, if you look at our current Jim launch business, it's all about doing the same thing over and over and over again and it's so boring, it's so boring, right?
All you do is you get really good at doing one thing and then that's it and as much as you want to do.
The next thing all you do is you go back to that first thing and you do it better.
3:25
You do it better.
You do better, right?
That's all you do.
Is you continue scale.
If you look at the difference in a 30 million dollar business at 100 million dollar business.
So right now we're on Pace for 30 million dollar run, right is where we're at.
Now, if you look at that versus 100, our business, they're virtually the same.
3:42
The only thing that changes is that 100 dollar business does more of the same thing.
They did you more instead of having 10 set, five sales a day, then you 15 sales today, that's it that's the only difference, they're not doing new verticals or not constantly trying to sell different things.
3:57
And they usually Cuts focus on the same customer Avatar.
And they solve the same problem with the really good solving, they sell it better, and that's it.
And so, is turning down these 250 thousand dollar day Consulting deals.
I can guarantee you that having that this is what has been.
4:13
Some of the reason for our success is that we've been able to focus on doing one for you to not.
Look at if you're a gym owner, not look at online training, not look at meal prep services.
Not look at all the many things that you can do that will distract you You know, doing this JV you're doing this, this 50-50 thing with my buddy, who's got this little thing going on the side like there are always things but I can guarantee you that the only set of strings attached and the strings are attached to your attention.
4:44
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to fifteen hundred dollars.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
5:05
And that's the most valuable asset you have now your time it's your attention.
And so even if we did do this 50,000 dollar Consulting day even if we did do this, 50 thousand dollar Consulting day, what would end up happening is That person after that day, it was still try and take attention.
5:22
And ultimately what that'll do, not allow us to fulfill on the promise that we made to our initial gym, owners who came to us.
And so if I take that same amount of attention and then I put it towards the existing model we have, and Brick by Brick continue to stack.
You'll make more and more and more focusing on those fundamentals, then you want anything else.
5:41
So sometimes you got to do more do, less, and item and forwards it.
Sometimes you got to go slow to go fast, and I really believe in that in the bud.
And he was a CEO of ten billion dollar company, the be 10 billion.
And now, my an extended period time where I was working, really, really closely with him.
5:57
I learned a lot of things from him and that was one of them, but sometimes you have to go slow to go fast and sometimes you just got to get good at one thing.
And all you have to do, is focusing on doing that thing, more and more, despite being an entrepreneur and wanting to do lots of things, the ones who make the most money are the ones, whose at least, right?
6:13
And by, at least, I'm not saying you don't work, I'm saying, you do the least amount of things, and you just do a few things extremely well.
So double down on that don't get distracted by shiny objects, the better, you are the better the opportunity have to say no to.
So keep that in the back, your mind, say no to the meal prep service, say no to the online, training things, they loaded, the train from Far, say no to the, you know, the little corporate deal that you might be able to set up because they will distract you from the main thing because those are not the end goal.
6:40
If you have the gym selling them get amazing results, get them.
Send more people to do that over and over and over and over again.
And then one day you will look up and be really, really That's the point.
All right.
So awesome.
A lot of us who just used to struggle and we basically self Sabotage by just putting ourselves on a separate plate, rather than just focusing.
6:57
Some of you guys right now have multiple things on your plate and you can't focus on it.
But I imagine if you only had one thing to focus on maybe was one location.
You have three.
You know, you should have done it.
You should have only had one, how easy would it be to make money with one location?
Super easy because you have all your attention on it, right?
7:13
Some of you are making attention with three but may not make money with three, same thing, if you multiple Business is you can't make it right A lot of times because your attention so split.
So folks in the one thing that makes you money do that over and over and over and over again until you're sick of it and then do more of it and I promise you'll make money.
7:31
All right, lots of guys have an amazing day.
I'll catch you guys on the flip side.
All right.








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
People who had mentors and coaches experience, four times, greater success than the exact same person doing it on their own, welcome to the game, where we talk about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
0:44
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on, everyone?
Happy Tuesday, but you guys are rocking and rolling and having an amazing start to your week, I wanted to talk about coaching It is something that is highly debated.
1:02
Oddly, and you see, you know, internet gurus, you see coaches all over the place, right?
And the reason I wanted to talk about this is because I think it's a super important topic for a variety of reasons.
One is why, you know, why is it important?
1:19
But secondly, why do you coaches get so much hate right?
And so I wanted to tell you what the data says, what science says.
And so I was having a conversation with dr.
Cash?
You can some of you guys know as a very close friend of mine and he was saying that he had just seen a paper.
That was a mega meta-analysis of the impact of coaching and mentorship on success right on how people are doing, right.
1:44
And they found over 40,000 research studies and when they Consolidated all of the information and they controlled for income and you know, IQ and all of the different things that could that could make one.
Person do better than another people who had mentors and coaches experience four times, greater success than the exact same person doing it on their own, all right?
2:11
And to me that seems like the most no-brainer reason.
I mean, why would you I mean, who wouldn't want to have four times greater success or four times faster results by having that, right?
And The thing is, despite knowing that despite knowing that every professional athlete every Olympian and every every major team has coaches for some reason, the general population or people at large still have so much hate for them, right?
2:36
And you can pair up.
If you've ever had any kind of code, you can probably think back and think like yes, I was coaching with this person and then many many times.
People have a negative impression of that person who they worked with, all right?
And so I like to dive into these types of things because must be like huge generalities, you know, sweet Across the board.
2:55
And I'm by no means immune to this.
I have tons of people that I've helped, you know, go from broke two million dollar-plus.
Jim that now avidly speed against me and I just like to think, like, what caused this, right?
And so I was reading, I think it's 50 scientific ways which is a phenomenal book by like, 50 scientific ways to persuade people or to get the yes, human read, something like that.
3:18
It's a one of Robert Kyle Genie.
Who is the author of influence and persuasion for both two of the best books.
Books on influence in marketing and sales that exists.
So he's co-authored this book in one of the chapters, highlighted something that I thought was like a huge eye-opener for me and it was that when doing a favor for someone, all right, and I'll show you how this relates to coach, when doing a favor for someone so perception of the favor, and how important how big it was?
3:48
Actually correlates with time and so immediately after you do a favor for someone, the person who received the favor thinks super highly of you because they were just in pain and they're immediately relief from the pain that they ran.
And then at that moment is when they believe what you did for them, to be of the highest importance of them, of the highest impact on their life.
4:11
Then over time, it just continues to decline.
Right over time over time it continues to go down of Their perception of what your favorite was and what it did for your, their lives.
Now, where this is gets interesting, is that the perception of the favored doer of you, right?
4:29
If you did the favor, you believe that the amount of effort and the amount of impact it had on the person's life, goes up over time.
And so immediately after you do something for someone is the moment where you feel like it was, it was nothing, it wasn't a big deal.
I just, you know, I just did this in this.
4:45
But the person received it was like, oh my God, this it was like I was stuck on this for two years and was horrible.
And as soon as you came in everything changed, right?
But if you revisit that same story, six months later, the person who got the favor is like, I mean I would have figured it out.
5:01
Anyways, you know, I'm a pretty pretty smart guy, really wanted to do it.
I would, if there wasn't that guy was someone else, I was going to figure it out, right?
Wasn't that big of a deal?
And then the person who did the favor is like, oh my God, I saved this guy's life and he doesn't even pop up on the Block, right whatever.
5:17
But the Is that this is a psychological bias and it's just real, it's just in people and so in recognizing that it can give you a little bit for me if Solace because I'm just like okay you know what's going on here but it's just it's a it's a scientifically proven psychological bias that exists in all humans and so I think that there's a couple of takeaways that I've taken from this and that you can to is that one if you, if you, if you're doing any kind of coaching, right?
5:46
It could be Fitness coaching.
You could be Be, you know, it could be your being a doctor and I'm using coaching that in a broad term, it could be mentorship.
It could be, you know, I mean it doesn't have to be designed to be business related times.
It could be anything right?
Is that?
If you so this is purely just me getting to the tactics by this.
If you do someone a favor, the time to ask for a favor in return, he's immediately immediately after you've done the favor.
6:10
Because at that point is where they will believe what you did for them was of the most importance right now.
You can also get into Probably secondary effects of this, which is if you can continue to do favors overtime, right?
Then you continue to have those, those windows of Goodwill, right?
6:28
And I think of it like a telephone telephone wire.
So you guys enter old school.
I don't even know if that's what they sing something, tough under power lines, where, you know, there's a pole and then it dips down, and then there's another poll, and then a dip down, and then it's another poll.
And just think of each of those polls as the Goodwill or the, or the things that you do to help people out.
6:46
But if you don't do that then, It just continues to go down in the touches the ground and then it you know, the wire blows up because whatever right.
Hey guys real quick.
If you're new to the podcast I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
7:02
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over 1,000 hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career.
7:18
I wish the partner with you so that's my give, go check it out Amazon, and back to the show.
And so I just find this really interesting because the favors I think also act a lot like information, right?
7:33
And if you sell information, like I do, right?
I sell a business model.
I saw sales training.
Is I, so you're going to be how to generate customers like myself, right?
Is that information?
Although incredibly valuable upon consumption immediately decreases in value, in perceived value to the person who consume it.
7:51
And so information is one of those.
Any interesting things that Is incredibly value but declines in value very rapidly, alright?
And so this is why, if you are teaching people things you need to consistently teach new things on a regular basis so that they can continue to have those telephone poles of over and over.
8:10
Again you breaking a belief or teaching a new thing or whatever it is so that they can continue to grow.
And I do think that over time there's some level of Goodwill that gets built but still most people are function on the what have you done for me lately, right?
And I just, You can be resentful of that and you can be the favored dealer who's like our change.
8:27
This guy's wife or you can just deal with the reality.
Is that people don't care right?
They'll just think about what you did for them lately.
And so I just see this as in credit like as statements of Truth and so then you can just act in accordance with that.
It's like so if you if you want, you know, you'll help someone lose 25 pounds working with you.
8:47
Then get the testimonial at that time, right?
At that moment, right?
Don't wait and then ask for it.
Six months later.
Because at this point they're gonna be like, well, I was going to join another gym.
You know, I was gonna probably do something either way.
And it was really me you doing all the dieting, I mean, yeah.
You know, he helped write whereas if you've done it right after they get off the scale and you tell him to come right in and then you do a great video, they'll have all the emotions they'll just have gotten out of pain little achieve their.
9:12
Their thing and thing is is they'll probably far more accurately depict how much of a change you really did in their lives, right?
And so I think this has far-reaching implications for Hey, the psychology of the coach but also be the psychology of the coachee, right?
9:29
And I think that I've experienced this myself with different coaches that I've had throughout my life recognizing myself internally.
It's like, you know, I look back on what they did and I think those same thoughts which is like I would have done it anyway.
I'm a winner winners win and I was going to happen now whether or not that's true doesn't really matter point is is that they were still the one who helped me out right.
9:49
And so you know giving respect to those people.
I think you can something that In the beginning of my career, I don't think I did as much as I do now, and I think it's partially just you know, maybe it's age, maybe it's experience, maybe it's Scar Tissue, you know, whatever it is.
10:05
But I have I think I have probably in the last Year or two been much better about giving massive amounts of respected.
People help me out earlier on in my life and and let me give you a different framing as well.
If you're the person who got received the favorite.
10:23
So I kind of talked about this from the coaching perspective, but talk about it from the from the student perspective is that like in my book which was released two years ago, a year and a half ago, whatever it is.
I've acknowledgments in the back and I have all people who influence me on that page, good and bad.
10:39
Because I still learned tremendous amounts from some of the people who are, what I would consider, maybe - that Source, right?
I learned, I learned what not to do a lot of times and still some of those people still broke beliefs of mine even if they weren't intending to write.
And so, I think Tony Robbins talks about this for you says, you know, blame them.
10:59
You can't just blame your mom or your dad, right for the insecurities.
They gave.
You also blame them for your resilience blame them for your ability to To persevere.
Blame them for all the positive characteristics that you developed as a result or in reaction to some of the negative things that they did.
11:17
Right.
And so I think that if you can adopt that perspective, it's one way mentally healthier for you, too.
You won't burn Bridges with people who probably did help you at some point.
And then three, if you are the coach, if you recognize that this is going to be a cognitive bias, this is going to be a psychological bias.
11:33
That's a needed All Humans.
Then you can adjust the way that you fulfill your business or you.
Coaching, which is one.
If you want to get someone to recognize what you did for them, you want to have that done immediately or as soon after they achieve their results, right?
And then secondarily you want to continue to put post up those telephone poles week after week month after month.
11:54
So that you don't have to have that information to climb over time.
And the only way to do that is work, right?
Is it requires effort like we have to continue to innovate.
We have to continue to make things easier.
You have to continue to strive to solve the next problem.
Because the good news for everyone, is that every single student you ever have?
12:13
As soon as you solve a problem, a new problem will be created from The Gap that you just that you just bridged, right?
They will just go across the bridge to the next Plateau where there's another Gap, where they need another Bridge built.
And so as long as you've been far that far ahead enough of the the people that you are teaching coaching mentoring student team, right?
12:34
You will be able to continue to build Bridge after Bridge after bridge for those people.
And it will force you to grow.
As a as a coach, as an entrepreneur, as a business owner, as whatever, right?
Because you will force to level yourself up so that you can continue to provide value because the value that you provide did has an expiration date.
12:52
So, over that valuable, both of them.
That interesting for me, I think it was really kind of connect all those pieces together.
It made a lot of sense in my own life for me as a student.
But also, for what I've, you know, experienced as a couch coach, or Mentor or hate the word Mentor, but you know, whatever.
13:09
As it, you know, as as somebody who developed business models on helps other people make more profitable businesses, it's been something that's been very valuable for me and honestly, just very calming to my spirits.
And so, anyways, I hope that makes sense to you.
Hope you found this valuable and if you did tag coach type, one of your coaches, take some of your trainers, take some of your friends, family, dogs, pet, higher power, whatever it is, otherwise have an amazing day.
13:32
Hope you guys have a crushing Tuesday and I'll talk to you about flip side.

Welcome to the game where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures.
And lessons, we have learned along On the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on?
0:32
Everyone?
Happy Saturday.
Hope you are rocking and rolling on this.
Beautiful day, I wanted to talk about a topic that I have recently brought up with a couple of entrepreneurs that I've been on the phone with, who are trying to scale or trying to get to the, you know, from the, the three million to the 10 million dollar range.
0:52
But I figured that you, even if you're not at that range, that you might want to hear what it is.
And I think it's one of the things that took me a really A long time to get over and as soon as I broke through this, this was definitely like definitely a bottleneck in my growth, okay?
1:09
And what it was was understanding what is good enough?
All right, now I've probably made a zillion podcast on having low tolerance and, you know, the the the Excellence of the team will fall to not their expectations, but the level of their training and culture and high performance, and all of those things and you actually do need to maintain that.
1:29
But But when it comes to growth, I think that there are also certain realities that you have to face, right?
If you're in a service based business and if you service you know it depends on your type of customer.
So let me give you a couple examples to make can I drive this point home Shopify and Spotify.
1:49
Right those companies have believe it or not pretty high turn like Spotify think and I don't like don't like don't talk about it but I'm pretty sure they have like 15 Percent monthly turn which is like ridiculously high, right?
Super high.
2:05
But they're still a wildly successful company super profitable and growing and you know super multi billion dollar company and Spotify the free music app that has a paid version.
Also has similar type stats.
I mean, they lose a tremendous amount of customers every year but they're still wildly successful.
2:23
And so, I think there's a couple things that we can take from that in terms of when we're looking at our own growth.
And so, So I fell into this trap at multiple different times and different businesses.
One servicing, weight loss, customers and second obviously serving small business owners in Jim's.
2:41
Is that, at some point?
You have to accept, especially from, if you're in a service based business that there's going to be an acceptable level of turn, right?
And turn can happen for a variety of reasons, right?
If you're in a small business environment, there's a certain percentage of businesses that go out of business every month, right?
2:58
There's also new Is the start of every month.
And that's that's just normal turns, kind of like unemployment can never get to 0, right?
Because there's only a certain amount of people who are between jobs and looking and I think to the same degree, it works that way in business.
And so the bottleneck in the Trap that I fell into was not pushing on the gas soon enough because I kept obsessing about churn numbers, right?
3:26
And you guys know a lot that I had that I obsess about turned but there is a point where the returns are so de minimis.
As in there, the diminishing returns that continue to decrease in terms of the amount of effort that you put in that, it makes more sense.
Allocating that same level of focus and attention to growth, right?
3:47
And so an easy example of this and this is probably one of the big takeaways that I can give you right now is that if you don't have a spreadsheet where you can make projections based on, Current numbers then you are wildly lost.
4:04
All right.
And so every big business that I have built has been built on an Excel sheet and I did it by moving the numbers into what I believe were acceptable numbers.
Right.
And so for example if you have a service business getting for like I'll just say small business owners right in a service space, Getting below. 10% churn is extremely difficult, right?
4:29
And at a certain point, the amount of effort and level of attention that you're putting to that far outweighs if you just put that same attention and effort towards doubling your front end volume, right?
And you can see it on on a graph, really simply that.
And I just, I went through this exercise with two of my directors and it was very eye-opening, which is why I'm making this podcast, all right?
4:50
We had goals and still do have goals, obviously, for four GL X, which is our new performance division, right?
It's growing like crazy right now, but they put some really big goals of where they wanted to hit.
And I walk them through the sheet and the projections and it became clear after moving the, moving the knobs, right?
5:10
And so, here are the knobs that we were moving and growth, and this is where you're probably putting your attention.
Right first is, what am I charging up, front?
What is my what is my cash up front in acquisition?
Right?
What am I making the first 30 days?
It's number one.
Number two is, what is my price for my ongoing service?
5:29
All right, because typically, there's going to be some sort of front end and some sort of back, right?
Third, what is my conversion from front and a back end.
All right, fourth, what is my churn on my back?
End service?
Right?
And and then on the, on the top side, how many, you know, how many, how many leads are coming in, how many, how many getting scheduled have near showing and how many we close it, right?
5:52
And so, if you think about that from the top, That I kind of went backwards and forwards.
But if you go, we've got this many leads this many schedule, this many showed this, to me, that are closing of the ones that are closing.
How much is the cash up front of the ones that are cash up front.
How many converts the back end?
What is my price of my back end?
And what is my turn on my back end over time?
6:09
Right now?
When you put all of those into it now sounds like a lot of numbers but it's not really it's literally just a vertical chart that you put on an Excel sheet.
You can extrapolate out how what you're going to be edit month, one a month to a month, three a month for because you're also going to For churn in that projection, right?
6:27
And what I would encourage you to do is not not like make those projections on your current numbers.
All right, this is like this is the biggest thing and I've had so many people come back in our company and Leigh Leigh used to joke about how accurate our projections were like.
She's like, I don't know how you fucking get this to, you know, guess this stuff.
6:44
It's a if you just take all of their variables into account and then you just put on the variable sheet.
What is not what you want it to be, or what you hope it to be, or what it was that one.
Tweak, but what it is right?
And the longer, the data that you can pull from to make those extrapolations, what I mean by that is if look at your don't look at your clothes right last week.
7:04
Look at your clothes rate over the last six months, right?
Don't look at how many leads you got last week.
Look at how many leads you got our last six months, right?
Like don't look at you.
Get them saying here is take the real data and then use that as your Baseline, right?
And so then what ends up happening is that you can change each of the knobs, and this is exactly what I did with.
7:24
Directors, I said let's see what happens if we take our training.
We cut it in half.
All right, let's see if we get our price and we bump it by 10%.
Let's see what happens if we increase our front end by another 10 percent right now, let's see, em at front and price.
7:40
Right, let's see, if I, if we bump that by 10%.
Now, let's see what happens if we increase our appointment volume.
Now of these knobs, which of them has the biggest impact in six months.
All right, second.
Which of these knobs do.
7:55
We feel that we have the highest degree of certainty that we can actually do?
And after we looked at everything, we came to them.
So the conclusion that we were at an acceptable level of churn, our price points were where we wanted them to be.
There's not a that's not too much more that we wanted to do with the pricing.
8:12
There's maybe we might have ten percent raises.
Nothing huge right that we thought that we could get given the amount of value that we were providing, but the one that seemed to be the most untapped Was believe it or not our marketing, right?
Our marketing.
Right now we've actually not been spending a tremendous amount of money.
8:28
We've been getting a lot of word of mouth and growth from that which has been awesome.
But we're not spending nearly the amount of tension or money.
We have in the past, all right.
We're actually spending a third Believe It or Not of the amount of money that we have spent in the past on marketing.
8:44
And so we determined as a director team.
If we simply just get that number and we go back to our old volumes, which means we have to hire a few more sales people, which is fine.
That alone was going to get us to our goal, all right, and so what are we going to do with the remainder of the things, right?
9:00
What are we going to do with, you know, churn what are we going to do with?
You know the price point that we're going to to hit on the back and what are we gonna do with all those things?
Nothing, we're just going to focus on that one number and getting back to improve because of all of the levers when we looked at the projections.
9:17
That was the one that six months from now, because that's where their goal is for January 6 months from now.
Is going to have the biggest impact on their goal.
Welcome, guys.
You guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
9:32
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you just leave review, but they can 10 seconds or one type of the thump.
9:52
It means the absolute world to me.
And more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
And so right now, if you do not have this, right?
And this is why I'm calling this acceptable level of, you know, good enough or or what will you tolerate, right?
10:08
Is that all sir for so long?
There's a certain point we have to look at the model, right?
If if the model doesn't make sense and there's too big of a hole in the bucket or there's not enough margin.
Did you have to fix the model?
And I would say that we've spent the last Four and a half months, building out this performance division, right?
10:25
Port building out the model, right?
Not just the not the product that we're selling the actual model around the product, right?
Because it's kind of 24.
At least, for us, there's two kind of businesses that we have.
We have the business that we've built for online fitness, right?
10:40
And there's also the built the business that we build around online fitness so that we can have our business to support those businesses, right?
And so is two entirely different businesses that we've had to build?
Over the last four months and I, and now it's been 16 or 18 weeks since we've really started this performance Division.
10:57
And it's grown so much that.
Now, I said, like after seeing all the numbers and we've tweaked and we've tweaked, and we've tweaked, we're like, okay now it's ready right now, given these numbers given these lifetime values given these 30-day cash values per customer, it is ready for growth.
11:12
And so the question is when do you get to that?
And what are the numbers?
Honestly, it's a purse.
It's not, I don't even want to say it's a personal opinion.
It comes down to What's the profit that you are making on the customer and then what are your relative cost of acquisition, right?
11:28
If the, if the, if the gap between those is too narrow, then you have to keep working on the model, right?
But at one point, you will get to a point where you're at, you know, for to 1521 in your first 30 days.
Especially if you're like doing our stuff.
If you're in the software world, it's like trying to get one to one and three months, but for most service-based businesses, if you can get, you know, for To 1521 in your first 30 days.
11:53
Then you're prepared for scale, right?
And it's really all be it.
All becomes about how can I just push more through this machine, right?
And that is all of the bottleneck and I'm just telling you this because we as entrepreneurs obsess about improving the little things, right?
12:10
And that's important to a degree.
But at some point you have to say this is good enough.
Let's put some gas on this thing and let's double our spend.
Let's quadruple our And then see what breaks right and so that is that is the process that I just went through.
12:27
You should see some, some, some big things on our side coming up and we hit some, we're doing some pretty big goals that we've set and I think that the believe it or not I think the pretty achieve when I think we're going to add them.
But within your team, the big takeaway from this, this is my single asked for anyone who's watching.
12:44
This is put each of those numbers on a vertical sheet and then do month 1 month 2.
Month three month, four month, five or six right on then all the way to month while if you want to.
All right, I'm doing six months because we change things quickly, right?
And and what you can do is just add a column before that which is current volume.
13:03
Because otherwise if you know, if you look 1224 months out, it's useless, right?
A million things are going to change between now and then.
But what you can do is if you always have a six-month model, then what you can do is as things change, you can change your today numbers and then that'll extrapolate out for the next six months.
So, if in three months, we come back and revisit it, I don't need to look at 12 months, I can Re-type in my current months numbers, which are populated, you know, month zero and then everything goes off of that.
13:29
Hopefully that hopefully that makes sense in terms of what I'm talking about.
But if you don't know how to do that, right?
If you're like I don't know how to make something like that.
Then that is a skill.
You need to have because if you don't even understand the basic math behind what drives, the revenue and profit in your business, then you're Flying Blind, right?
13:46
Like you're like, I want to hit this goal.
Well, how like, how you going to do it, right?
And simply walking backwards from the math.
And then moving, each of the levers will give you so much insight into what are the things that matter and what are the things that don't matter.
All right?
And so when you're looking at the knobs that you're turning, the question is, how big of an impact does it have?
14:06
And then How likely is it that I can actually achieve this.
This Delta, right?
This change.
Do I think that it's reasonable that I would be able to get our sales team to close twice as many people on the phone on average.
Maybe it, maybe, maybe 16 weeks ago when we started out selling this new thing, maybe now, it's pretty, we're pretty well-oiled in terms of like if someone's getting on the phone and they're prepared and they have the working capital to do this, they're probably going to work with us right to a degree that I don't feel like me exercising more in that direction is likely for us to double, right.
14:41
Do I feel like it's reasonable given, you know, us looking at all the exit interviews and the data that we have from people who, you know, choose not to stay with us which, you know, obviously Part of business.
It happens.
Looking at what's coming from that?
Do I reasonably believe that we can cut that in half from where we're at now?
14:58
Four months ago, I was like actually four months.
We've actually pretty good on that side.
But point is that if we had some major issue there then I would say okay we need to attack this until we get it to an acceptable level, right?
And then once these pieces are there, do I think that I believe that we could double our spend.
15:16
Yeah.
I think I can double my spend much more likely than Than cutting my churn or in half or doubling my clothes rate, or doubling my shohreh, right?
If you're at 70%, shogo appointments, you're not going to get to a hundred and forty percent.
Alright.
And so getting from 70 to 80, Mike takes the same amount of effort.
15:35
It takes to go from 100 you.
No new leads to 150 New Leads which would be a 50% increase in business which we'd never be able to squeeze out of our clothes rate or our show rates, right?
And so at some point you just have To make the call and say this is good enough, these metrics work, we just have to do more, right?
15:56
And a lot of times what you'll find is that when you make that decision, to do more, you'll learn a whole lot more things that will break over time.
But doing that, you actually realize absolute profit rather than like return on adspend profit.
16:13
Right?
Because that's what I see.
A lot of small entrepreneurs obsess about it.
So like you don't getting 12:50.
I'm not willing to.
I want to, I don't want to drop below that.
It's like, Well I mean I would rather get you know three to one on a million bucks then 10 to 1 in 10,000, right?
And so it's just a question of what level game you want to play.
16:30
But doing this exercise extrapolating out off of your current real numbers and looking at each of the percentages in the variables and saying, if I increase this how much of an effect will it have?
And then How likely do I think is actually being able to achieve this difference is, well give you immense Clarity into the Our to bottlenecks, you may have and then you can focus all of your attention on those and just leave the rest, right?
16:56
Just say, like, I am, I'm willing to accept that these are at an acceptable level of turn of close rate of show rate of whatever, right?
And it's the same thing with like funnels, right?
Some people love tweaking with stuff on it at all the time at a certain point, like if our funnels converting at, you know, 35% I'm like, okay I'm good with that.
17:16
How much effort is going to take us to get from 35 to 40 or 85, I don't know, right?
But do I think that it's much easier for me to increase my head spun by 25% to just increase that volume.
Probably and so, which of these doors is that is the surest path of the highest likelihood path of me, hitting your goal and just doing it.
17:34
And that's pretty much it.
And so this has been a bottleneck for me, two or three times in my career.
And so I'm hoping that if maybe just one of you listens to this, and actually takes the 25 minutes to just put the numbers on a sheet and look What happens over the next six months?
17:51
Given your current volume.
We found with my directors was at our current volume levels.
We weren't going to grow much more than maybe another 15 to 20 percent Top Line.
And all of us didn't have that goal and I was like, all right well which of these things is going to get us to what your goal was.
And when we did that became it became abundantly clear that, that what we need to do is go back to spending more money on ads bed and that's what we're doing.
18:13
So I hope that makes sense to you.
I hope that was of value to you and hopefully breaks one person through the bottleneck.
Time's the easiest thing to double the business is just double the amount of customers that are coming in the door, right?
Once you have the other pieces dialed in and you have profit margins here, your 30-day cash is good.
18:29
So you don't have cash flow issues.
And, and the, the you're at acceptable Levels, Close rate, show rate, churned Etc, at some point, you just gotta say, all right, we're good enough.
Let's put some rocket fuel on this and so I leave you with that the Saturday.
18:44
I hope you have an amazing day and weekend and maybe you take the extra You know, 10 minutes and do that exercise because I guarantee you that you will make more money by doing that.
And at the very least have Clarity into what the bottleneck of your business is without further Ado have an amazing day.

What's going on, everybody?
I'm bringing some more books, but I wanted to say that, if you haven't checked out Hunter million-dollar offers, I would definitely suggest that you start there.
I've gotten some solid feedback and it couldn't be happier with its.

On Amazon, the Kindle book is 99 Cents.
The audiobook is Lowe's, they'll let me put it on for it, so I think it's 12 bucks.
So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
There's actually Four requirements from the buyer to the seller and three from the seller to the buyer.
0:36
Welcome to the game, where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on, everyone?
Happy Friday.
Hope you guys are having a good end of week with your stats with your team.
0:51
Hopefully was a good week for you.
I wanted to make this video because I had a little bit of an epiphany recently.
So You know, I've studied a lot of marketing and sales stuff throughout my career.
And there have been, you know, I've read lots of different sales, you know philosophies and marketing stuff and there has been this huge crystallization of understanding the components of a closed deal and so there are requirements from the seller to the buyer and also requirements from the buyer to the seller.
1:24
And so there's actually four requirements from the buyer to The seller and three from the seller to the buyer which is really interesting when you when you take this apart and so what is required for someone to be a prospect.
1:39
All right, so there's a term called bant or it's an acronym called bant bant.
And where, I first heard of this was in the software world, the SAS world.
And one of the nice things about the software world is that they're incredibly quantitative.
And so they have already codified the requirements for a sail.
1:58
And so, typically, in the software World, especially Ali enterprise software, you transitioning Prospect to a closer or to an account executive.
Once they have met all four of these requirements.
If someone does not meet all four of the band requirements, they're not able to be passed on and so those requirements are as followed be is budget, right?
2:19
Do they have the budget for this thing?
Hey, authority to, they have the decision-making power to make the call on whether or not they or their company can do the deal, right?
Third, do they need this solution?
Do they need this?
This issue, whatever it is.
Do they have a problem that needs to be solved with this thing?
2:37
Fourth timing, what is their timeline and are they willing to get started today, right?
And so, those are the four components that a seller requires from a buyer, right?
Unless a buyer has all four of those things they cannot and will not buy.
On the flip side, the three requirements from a from a seller to a buyer are that they trust.
3:00
The product is going to solve their problem.
They trust that the salesman is being honest.
Otherwise, they will not trust what they're saying about the actual solution that they're you know, that they're pitching them on and then finally that they trust the company.
Alright?
And so those three I heard I've heard from both Jordan Belfort Grant Cardone.
3:19
There's the first places that I heard those three specifically.
And that's actually what we operate in our company is a sales team.
Is that we make sure they call the three tens.
And so that's you need to be a 10 out of 10 on the product.
Need to be a 10 out of 10 on the salesman.
This is a trustworthy guy, really knows what he's talking about.
3:35
He's quick, you sharp and then you need to be a 10 out of 10 on the company, there's a trustworthy company.
I feel good about doing business with them, right?
And so if you think about any sale in general, those all seven components have to be met in order for someone to say.
3:50
Yes, right and sometimes And obviously the, you know, the the bat requirements for somebody doing a free trial or very different than someone buying a fifty thousand or a million dollar your software right there, they're different.
But the fundamental components remain the same.
The reason this was interesting to me, was that a friend of mine, Who's In, The Biz Ops face was recently talking about.
4:10
He'd done a review on the last six months of sales application.
So they applications that have come in to, you know, purchase of product and he had almost removed a question about timing.
Right on his application.
And once he did the data review, he found out that 95% of all of his sales came from people who said, either, they were willing to start immediately or the next day and only 5% of his sales came from people who said that they, you know, they wanted to start at a later time and literally immediately or the next day.
4:43
And so, he now took the action of no longer even calling people who said that they didn't want to start immediately because he looked at his data.
This is the power of data, right?
Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
4:59
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that, you mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
5:21
And so we had Jim watching.
You will see this in our applications.
Now we're actually adding the only four questions we have.
So we've actually been able to prune down our application to the only four requirements of a buyer, right?
Are you, you know, are you a do you need this thing, right?
5:37
Do you have the desire and the ability to do this, do this implementation, or this?
Do the solution to do, you have the authority to make the decision on your own for a financial thing?
Right 3, do you have the budget?
Budget.
That's required in order for us to be able to work with you and then for when you want to start, right?
5:58
And so immediately or you know later, right?
And so now, this is just allowed us to be so much more efficient in our process, because we know that if we have all four of those, then we come into the sale with a clean slate, right?
Like, we only have two.
We only have three components left for the salesman to cover, right?
6:16
Rather than having to deal with budget, or dealing with decision, you know, whether they Make the decision or whether they want to start immediately or they need to think about it, right?
And so, if we can cover those initially and we can set those as prerequisites and requirements of the buyer that it massively facilitates the sales process, right?
6:33
And so for me, it was just a nice, aha moment of thinking, I've heard of bent, I've heard of you need all four of those.
I thought about those within the context of a sale, right?
And on the flip side, I thought about, you know what, what is required to get someone to say, yes, right.
And so, it was only by, like recently.
6:50
When I Guys, we had to put both of those things together.
The requirements of the buyer and the requirement to the seller, that it really, it crystallized to my mind.
And so hopefully you think that's as cool as I did for us.
Simply, by adding that new new style of questionnaire, we've actually been able to, and here's what's, here's what's wild about this.
7:06
We added this, this this form into our into our application, you know, into into working with us and it actually increased our cost per booking by two-and-a-half acts, which is a lot Right?
I mean, it's like, it have to have a big increase, you know, in throughput, in order to account for that type of increased in in cost, right?
7:29
But it wasn't cost of acquisition, it was cost per book, all right?
And so here's where it gets fascinating.
So, as soon as we implemented, this, we actually, even though we had a two and a half X spike in our cost per booked call, our actual sales went up and that's what's Wild.
7:47
Our actual gross sales during the time period that We put this in went up and so we made more money even though we had two and a half X less or fewer opportunities.
And so that's when I just love when data comes together and actually creates a real, a real outcome.
8:04
And so anyways, I figured I would share that with you because I think it's incredibly powerful.
I just I just box rustles like that so cool.
And so I figured I would share it with you guys because I thought that you also would find that pretty cool as well.
So beyond that, I hope you're having an awesome Sunday if you can, are sir.
8:21
I don't know what that is if you can drop a comment or like if you do dig this, if you're listening on the podcast, hope you enjoyed it.
Made it quick and hopefully you can use this in your business to help more folks.
Make more decisions to help themselves by working with you.
So keeping awesome and I'll catch you guys on the flip side back.








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
What's up everyone?
Welcome to district is podcast.
My name is Alex and I am your host.
Just on this beautiful day in Puerto Rico.
If you are a gym owner and you would like to make a couple extra dollars, then go to, I don't hate money.com and we love to chat with you.
0:43
Now that being said, today we're going to talk about steps to Freedom.
That's what we call it and it's basically how do we get someone from owner operated with no employees to completely owner with zero operations or as little operations?
0:59
As I you know as I think is necessary for one location, right?
And so I just want to walk you through these phases, just so you know what it's supposed to be, okay?
So first your training, all the sessions, you're doing all the admin, you didn't bail, and you're doing everything, right?
1:17
Who's the first hire?
You have first.
Hire you have, is someone to train and cover your afternoon sessions.
Why?
Because that is, when sales appointments come in.
And so, the highest and best use of your time is to sell.
Because if you can sell, let's say even two persons a week.
1:33
On a 500 dollar program or which you should be selling the ticket to high ticket.
Anyways, but let's say you sell to people, we on a 500 program that means you're making a thousand dollars a week and you can cover the afternoon, which cost you $300, right?
Because if you have three sessions a day, five days a week in the afternoons, you can cover those for about 300 bucks, right?
1:55
So I mean, it's 15 sessions, whatever you pay, I'm saying, $20 all in for a session that gets you to 300.
Okay?
So that means that you made 700 profit on that other guy's time, pretty cool?
Right.
Awesome.
So, what's the next step to Freedom?
Now, obviously, we can start showing a like, you spent that time because the rest of those hours that you got back in the afternoon you should be working on getting more of those people in the door so you can sell.
2:18
But the question is if the only thing you have to do is train in the morning in the rest of your day, was dedicated to Ward.
It's getting more people in your door inside of.
Do you think if you spent eight hours a day talking to people that you can get one person today or even I mean, seriously one.
Sunita to hop a new gym.
2:34
Is that the way we do it?
No, I'm just making a point.
Like, do you think that you could do it probably, right?
And so that time is valuable because you are more valuable than the $50 an hour, that's something else you could do the same role as you or twenty, dollars an hour for the trainer, your time is better.
2:52
Spent doing other things, right?
So, Second Step Up.
Step to Freedom is hiring someone for morning, s?
Right?
So you hire someone for morning sessions then.
You had another $300 a week.
So now you're at $600 a week, so it's $24 a month and you have three morning sessions through the afternoon, sessions doesn't need to be an expensive business, right?
3:12
But now you're not training any sessions anymore and you do that second second thing mostly so that you can have Cindy and not want to kill yourself because we can't before him every day stinks.
So it's really so that you're happy.
So that's why that's the second step to Freedom.
3:28
All right, third step to Freedom is hiring your first Administrative Assistant.
Okay, this person is going to help.
You can go an assistant manager to go into politics, right?
This person is going to work with you to help.
Take some of the administrative burden from the business off of you.
3:44
If you have campaigns that are running actively than this person, is going to help you make phone calls and get people in the door.
If you don't have active campaigns in this person's going to be helping you with all the billing Facebook, comments, and the emails, and the basic messages that you get, so that you can free up your time so that you can learn how to generate leads and then they can help you with that, right?
4:02
The next higher is yet, wait for it.
Another Administrative Assistant.
Now you're like really the fourth higher is kind of a flex higher, right?
And reason I say that is that it's a flat tire because you can either like, you can have it as a sales person, so they can start taking sales off, food off your plate, but they should still probably have a certain amount of administrative Miss to them.
4:28
So, in a perfect world.
I'd have to administrative assistants leftist.
Managers and then one sales manager.
But if you don't have this situation and you really would like to have someone stuff for you, then your your next higher could just be a sales manager, okay, but that means that you're also going to be doing probably the spillover administrative work that the assistant manager couldn't take on right with to administrative systems in a sales manager that location is now a lock, right?
5:00
And so if you think about the typical gym, that's a CrossFit bootcamp, whatever will probably have four to six.
Trainers.
And you're like, wait, I thought such a freedom, you only hired one person.
You need to hire one person.
You see a higher poverty, people to fill those things.
But their role is the same, which is the training and so that is phase.
5:22
One is your hiring trainer so you never get on the trading floor so you stopped doing twenty dollar an hour jobs.
The second thing you do is you stop doing another $20 an hour job or $15, an hour, $13 an hour, whatever, administrative job.
So you hire to be able to do that And then last thing in this is, this is one that can take time.
5:39
If you only have one facility in your young and hungry, I mean, I sold for my facilities for a long time.
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
5:55
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I catch the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
6:18
I like selling and hopefully you do too, especially if you're a little like sewing.
It's the highest and best use of your time.
Now, at a certain point, you just say I would rather trade some money to have time back and the money that you're trading is the sales that that salesman would make that you would not make now in a perfect world.
6:36
You find a Salesman is just as good, if not better than you, they do exist.
It's just they're not common.
So if you find one that's awesome.
Make sure they stay busy, but those are the steps of Freedom.
So if you're in a position right now Like, I don't see like, what like what do I need to do next.
6:51
You need to be able to have the ability to make $300 a week to cover someone else for the afternoon.
The first thing you second, you need to do is have another $300 to cover the mornings and now that's done.
Now you have all of your data back to run your business then you hire someone to do an administrative assistant number one, Administrative Assistant, number two, that gets all of the stuff that you hate doing off your place.
7:12
So the only thing you do is you meet my new clients, sell them and then give exceptional service to your customers and get them happy.
And then once you're done that then you can hire someone else to handle that for you.
And then you can come in and check on the numbers every day.
And just make sure that sales are being done lead, German calls.
People are getting service to cleanse, your getting picked up and everyone is happy.
7:30
So those are the steps to Freedom.
Hope that was useful for you.
Hope you have an amazing day, keep being awesome cameras Rule.
And if your gym owner and you would like a hand or you just want to get to the next level and see how we get Jim six figures once we would love to show you how down Loader for case study at gym on secrets.com for /widths.
7:51
And if you're feeling totally crazy, you can apply on the next page, have an awesome day, right?







0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
It's called the Chinese rule 3 and 10.
All right, so systems break, essentially, every time you triple them, welcome to the game, where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer, and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:40
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on everyone?
Happy Thursday, hope you guys are having a good end of week.
Ish home stretch.
I had a really introspective day yesterday.
I kind of reached a little bit of a moment of frustration because, you know, no matter how many Ways we've cut it.
1:02
You know, we did.
I like to be transparent with our numbers because I just think it's easier for everyone.
And I say these things only to provide context.
It's, you know, if you take it arrogantly, then maybe this isn't the podcast for you.
But, you know, two years ago, three years ago, we did 28 million last year.
1:20
We did 37 million and this year we're on Pace for, you know, right around 30 again.
And I've been trying to figure out, you know, I've really over the last few years trying I to mix and match things change offers change price points and I have pretty much just been continuing to stay at the same level and it's been really frustrating for me.
1:39
And I know that in talking to different mentors of mine, the the jump from 30 to 100 because everything, the jumps that happen in business are in.
It's called the Chinese rule 3 and 10, right?
So systems break essentially every time you triple them, right?
So to 100,000 a year at 300,000, a year at a million a year, three million a year.
2:00
Ten million a year at 330 million a year.
So each of those you just freeze intense, right?
And so the next big jump for us would get to you know 90 to 100 million dollars a year and I'm trying to figure out.
All right, have been trying to figure out what is it?
Like, what am I missing?
What is my, what is my problem?
2:15
And so to make this, hopefully tackle for everybody on here, what I want to do is break is explain the beliefs that has gotten us to where we are.
And I think the belief that I have identified has been and holding you back for the next jump and so forth.
Big beliefs up to this point that I will consistently break for people who are you know, at a million and try to get it free or at 3:00 and trying to get 10, right 10 and 20 to 30 is first that they need to spend more on Advertising from every single time that we've tracked data over an extended period of time.
2:48
What we get back on our marketing is far greater than what we can immediately measure.
And so you know being a being willing to go - in the acquisition ultimately ends up benefiting Us in the long run and the Companies, the world.
They're so negative on the acquisition because they're not even doing that.
3:04
They Grant, right?
And that's such a concept that earlier on in my career I was like that's such horseshit like, well, you know, they make a lot more money than you.
So maybe there's more than one but they finally just know that the more dollars, the more awareness they spread about their brand, the more ends up coming back then, right?
3:20
And so we've seen this time and again, I mean, we spent a very small amount of money on our book funnel, for example, and a huge percentage of the buyers that we We have came into that funnel but I was actually losing a lot of money on that funnel when I ran it.
And so we may end up starting that back over again.
3:36
Because once people saw it, and then spend a little bit more time and consume the value.
They're like, wow, these are really good at this, right?
Maybe I will work with them but it wasn't immediately measurable, right?
And so the first belief that I've had to get over in that I have to break typically for other entrepreneurs is being willing to spend more on marketing in general, right?
3:56
Like and usually just need to see somebody who you perceive is appear.
And this is especially true.
If someone started the same time as you in business and all of a sudden start doing better neither like what are they doing?
If you see them starting to spend a thousand a day and you're spending 100 a you're like, oh my God, that's what I need to do.
But it's like, for some reason it's only when someone's like a pure view lodge and then they start doing it that all of a sudden you start doing it too, right?
4:16
It's the same thing, thousand to go to 5,000 a, in the 5,000 and 10,000 a 10,000 to 25,000 a.
Like, it really just comes down to Breaking that belief of what's possible, even though it's literally just a number, right?
It's the first is the ad spend the Second, big belief is wrong price, right?
4:33
Is that and this is typically for I would say entrepreneurs that are that are that are earlier on is breaking the Blazer and price that you can charge or significant amount of money for the services that you offer and render and you will ultimately make a lot more profit and I go and talk about pricing a lot about how you can increase prices by 20% and if you're running a 20% margin business then you actually double your profit.
4:55
And so profit is what precedes growth.
It does not come after growth, you Profit in order to grow.
I've heard so many people be like I'm not making any profit industry investing in growth, that's not how it works.
Like in the in the in the software world of the high-growth world.
5:10
There's a tremendous amount of actual profit that they then reinvest only in growth.
It's not that we lowered our price so that we could get more people.
That's the fallacy, right?
You actually raise your price because then you have profit to invest in marketing in hiring talent to then grow afterwards.
5:26
So it's backwards, right?
You don't lower the price to get more people in.
In many circumstances, not all, not all, but in many circumstances, you raise the price rates, the margins, raise the value, so that you can hire more people and then invest more than one, because you have more profit left over, right?
That's the difference.
The third is that you need to hire more sales, people.
5:44
I cannot tell you the amount of times that I've seen that you more sales people.
You hire and more money you make.
And that's because sales, people also have to feed themselves, right?
And so they will find ways to make more sales for you to feed themselves.
And so a lot of times there's limiting beliefs around like, well I have two sales people's.
I will, why don't you have file format?
5:59
You have ten.
Right.
And then it also will force you to increase your ad spend because you have to feed more people.
And so sometimes it's a backwards way of doing it, but sometimes it's an easy way to get people started, all right?
And the fourth is Around Talent.
And this one is the thing that has been holding me back for the last three years.
6:14
In this kind of the subject of this of this podcast, which is at every level you need to consents, consistently increase the talent pool, that is working with you, right?
And so most entrepreneurs, and they start out or at least myself, you know, You know, you try to do everything right?
6:31
And then assert your like, no can do it as well as you and to be fair you're probably right at a certain point but at one moment you will find somebody who's better at one thing.
Not all things than you are and then they can replace that function from you, right?
And it's easy to say in theory but it's hard to do in practice and oftentimes you need to pay more people or you need to pay more and this is again where the Prophet comes in so that you can acquire higher level talent.
6:53
And so the first thing that you Outsource is doing, right?
So the first thing that you stop doing is you Outsource all of the Wing of things, right?
The next thing that you end up Outsourcing and finding talent for is the management of the do it, right?
So it's people who are managers who have experienced who are detail-oriented who can follow you can follow and track metrics, right?
7:12
That's management and then the next level and so like if we're looking at this in levels like doing is usually your first 514 right?
That's usually the thing that's going to get you to a million, right?
Once you start delegating out the management of the people, then you can get to 3ish million, right?
7:29
Right.
And this is obviously a little Flex at once in the business.
All right.
Go from three to ten million, you start Outsourcing, the leadership of those people.
And Leadership is a very different skill.
And so, if you think about what an employee does, overall, first you have individual contributors, then you have managers and then you have leaders and typically, it's difficult for the same person to move through all three.
7:51
A lot of times you have to pull from the outside and this is something that we've made a ton of mistakes on.
I just continue to raise people up from in-house, right?
Because I thought that they would be able to make those Transitions and grow as quickly as desired.
And a lot of times they couldn't write, they could make one of those jumps but not usually, two of them, and then they break and they reduced their level of, we did get up to their level of incompetence and they just couldn't go in the flounder.
8:16
But, and so, we've now Outsource leadership, I'd say to agree to a decent degree.
I would say we're about halfway there on that one, but the thing that has stuck that has gotten me stuck at 30 million dollars.
As for three years in a row, which I am so stoked about when I say that sarcastically.
8:35
Because it drives me nuts.
Is because I've been trying to figure this out for a really long time because I, you know, you think it's a model, you think you to optimize something you can get to the ads or the copy of the message, or the funnel or the price point?
Like, you know, it's not an Excel problem.
It's a people problem and virtually all problems in business are people problems.
8:51
Once you crack a million four million dollars a year, it's all about people which is not the sexy and fun stuff, but it's the stuff that actually scales companies, which is why when you hear these huge billionaire talking talk about how it wasn't them, it was really their team and you hear that you're like a sure.
He's just saying that they won't think my friends and family but the reality is that it really is the team and what I talked to guys who have done a billion, when I talk to you guys who have done 700 million, they like look at me in the eyes they're like, You need a smarter team, you need people smarter than you.
9:25
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this, which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs drawn-out stuff, sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel.
It's absolutely free.
So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, Right, and it's easy to say, but it's hard to do because sometimes it's also intimidating to hire someone who's smarter than you feel like, oh my God, you can kind of exposure like this from this morning, right?
9:56
And especially when it comes down to Niche down expertise, right?
Because the smarter you are at something, typically the deeper you've gone in it, and that's where, you know, in huge Corporate America, you have Specialists to do this one specific type of subsets category Finance, right?
10:12
And so, what I have failed at And I will, I'm trying to rectify, this is I have not delegated out.
I have not found out how to replace.
Thinking.
And so what I mean by that, it's not that the people might seem don't think obviously they think.
10:28
But specifically it's the attention to growth and taking initiative on information.
Alright, a lot of guys, a lot of people in our company take initiative.
They see a problem to take an issue.
If they you know I mean they're you know, the client is an issue.
10:43
They take initiative.
That's what they should do, right?
That's that's what they're supposed to do.
But what a CEO does would an executive does is that they take the data in.
And they look at the data and they can spot proactively before a problem occurs, where a problem will occur right there able to look into the future using data and extrapolate out where a problem exists.
11:09
And then engage the leadership to try and figure out how we can prevent this problem from happening before it actually escalates.
And so fundamentally when I looked at this, because Leila Leila, you know, being the kind-hearted wife that she is It was like you're the problem, right?
11:24
Like you're the issue, like you have not leveled up this piece, you still try and control everything right and at a certain and as you grow you always have to relinquish levels of control and the level of control that I have not relinquished yet and I am now currently working on it.
11:40
I'm not there yet.
Is is being able to either find someone who can think that way or can duplicate the mental thought process that I go through.
And so there's two, there's two issues with this.
At least the two problems that I have right now in my business.
11:56
Is that my data reporting is not good enough.
It's not clean enough.
It's still, it's still pull based what I mean by that is I have to go and pull the stats from things, which means that they're like, why don't have that said, I have to manually count on that you, that number tomorrow and that might be two or three things that I have to take two or three different metrics, put them together to examine a problem, right?
12:17
And so whenever I see a problem that's coming up and there's there's fundamentally two different sides of the business that I look at.
So hopefully guys working with me breaking this down because I really making the training for the next person to be doing this thinking in our business is we have acquisition big picture and then we have fulfillment.
12:33
I mean, it's literally just the two big things that I break it down into because, you know, at a certain point you're looking at it from a 10,000 10,000 foot overview from an acquisition standpoint.
I'm looking at, are we acquiring the number of customers that we should acquire right now to hit our growth metrics?
12:53
Right.
And so I guess one step before that is, if you have not reverse-engineered, what your goal is, and how to achieve it, then it will never work.
So, right now, if you don't have a spreadsheet that says, if I sell this many people on the front end, I'm going to get to this level of Revenue and cap out if you don't have that on an Excel sheet.
13:11
And it's gonna take this many months to get there, assuming these numbers you're never going to get them, right?
So you have to build the model first and the projections out of how long it's going to take you to do to get to that number.
Once you have the model and you believe that the numbers and this is where like some some experience and some scar tissue is helpful is like are these numbers realistic.
13:31
Not what can you do?
Not what closing percentage?
You have not you know how good the marketing is when you're running everything, not what the retention is.
When you're doing one on one coaching with everyone, but what is right, what's happening?
Right now, use your existing model and you can extrapolate.
13:47
These numbers are good enough for growth, right?
And I believe that, if we can, if we can just increase this front end, then we Hit this level of total revenue and profit within two months, six months, 10 months, Etc?
Right then, once you have that model, you have to stick to that model.
14:02
And your job as CEO, or at least, this is how I perceived the job to be, is to hold the team accountable to that.
And a lot of times it's looking at the metrics consistently cooling, the metrics from them, which is one of the problems I'm having, is it some literally pulling these metrics in real time rather than having them already displayed to me every day?
14:23
Day because I bother the crap out of my team all day long trying to pull metrics from them.
When I really should have them already in front of me, and it should be done on a weekly basis.
And this is my own Problem by this is on me.
That's my fault.
But once you have the data that's in front of you, on the acquisition side, I'm looking at.
14:39
Am I getting these number of sales?
If I'm not getting this number of sales?
Then first, I'm looking at, is it an execution problem?
Is it?
We have the process, we have the play, the people aren't doing their job, right?
If it's an execution problem, then it's one of three things.
And I know this sounds like complicated but it's like this is the thought process because I'm trying to document this and this is why it's been difficult for me to do this because in my head it sounds like this big amorphous thing.
15:04
When it Aldi everyone follows a process, whether you think you do or not everyone follows a process, if you do the same things over and over again, right?
And so, first is an execution problem, if it's an execution problem, it's one of three things.
The team is a motivated, they're not well trained, or there's something is unclear about communication, all right?
15:20
And so each of those things can become can be from poor leadership.
It can become, they can come from expectations that have not been repeated or been clear.
They can come from poor training or not repeated training for them.
In terms of with the quality of the training, we put People through.
And what do we do consistently on a daily basis?
15:36
To make sure they continue to execute at that level, right?
And so that's that's just is it an execution problem, all right?
The next issue is like okay once you check all those box you're like it's not an excuse problem.
Like is it a system problem, right?
And that could be like, is the process that we are following.
15:52
Not a good process.
Is it too complex?
Is it too simple?
Is it leaving things out?
Is it something that is too difficult for some to execute on a continuous basis, right?
So, I'm going to look at those pieces.
And if I feel like No, it's not.
Then I have to get the kind of the third thing, which is, I need to look at the, the marketing overall is the message, correct, right?
16:13
Is the, the message crept is the creative.
Correct, is the funnel in the layout, correct, right?
Is the process that comes after The Funnel correct, and make sense, and then if all of those things check out, then it means that the product itself needs to change, right?
16:30
The thing the offer itself he's doing so very rarely, you want to change the The offer because it means you change the entire business, right?
But those are all of the things that perceive changing the offer, and that's just on acquisition, right?
But all of that.
So you can just reverse engineer, we should be getting this many sales, right?
16:48
And if you are getting those me sales, then if we're not making the number of the revenue number that we should be making that it means, it's a back-end issue.
And so then when I look at the back end, I'm looking at the pricing the turn and I'm looking at the lifetime value of the customer.
Now, if those It's not where they're supposed to be.
17:06
Then I again have to look into.
Is it an execution problem?
Is it?
Motivation is the skills as a training?
No, is it the systems that we have that support it?
No, then is it the product, right?
Is the product, not delivering the result.
Consistently enough that everyone can execute it and achieve the results were looking for right or that we want them to have.
17:27
And so, when I'm looking at the product itself, right?
The breakdown there is is Where we just start, we start we run beta test, right?
We run we consistently remittances to improve The Mousetrap to improve the product that were ultimately selling.
And so I know that that seems like I just want really tough, but it's like a very, very, very high level gloss over.
17:47
But this has been the reason that I have not practically morning.
I mean, I have needed 37 last year, but, you know, it's still the same, the same tier of Revenue.
And it's because I have not been able to find someone or I have not been able to train up someone to think like that, you know?
18:04
Business.
And as a result it has been still needing me to make those thoughts and pull that data proactively because I have to think if I'm not here.
Would anyone look at these numbers?
18:19
Would anyone predict that there's going to be a problem?
And I think the answer is no, I don't think.
I think the answer is, no, I don't think anyone would do in our company, and that's my fault.
That's my fault.
They should, they should do that.
And so, what I'm going to be working on right now, Now, or the next two quarters is, how can I either find or create the leader that has this skill set?
18:42
And then how can I create the systems that support the data dashboard and the data collection?
So that that person has the school that the tools to be able to do this without constantly disrupting the team.
And so that.
And this, this may seem super unsexy for you.
18:58
Maybe this is, this is a not the the context of the issues that you're dealing with right now.
But I can tell you that it is, by far, the issue that I'm dealing with.
And I think that there are levels to the game.
I think that the quality of the people that you hire is a belief set that needs to be continually broken, right?
19:18
Steve Jobs is known as being one of the best talent recruiters and motivators of all time.
People said he was ruthless and he was a tyrant to work for, but they always said that he just knew how to get the best out of people.
And so I see that as a skill sets, a billion-dollar skill set because he never so did anything and even found people to do the thinking for him.
19:37
But the one thing that he was able to do is duplicate and or find the realest players for each of those specific skill sets.
And so I see that as the problem that I have encountered in my entrepreneurial journey and it's been a strength of mine.
19:52
And so, a lot of times, your biggest strength, becomes one of your biggest weaknesses because it becomes difficult for you to Outsource it and duplicate that skill and someone else.
And so hopefully, you found this valuable.
It sounds kind of Pie in the sky.
This isn't a how do you close a credit card in 30 minutes type of podcast?
20:08
But this is this is the real stuff like this is why I haven't grown past 30, I think.
And so I'm going to be doing everything I can to try to do.
So lots of love.
I hope you guys have an amazing Thursday and of week and hopefully, it just gets you to think about the types of people you're bringing in as like, does this person totally take the doing away from me?
20:28
Does this person totally take the management away from me?
Does this person take Polly take the leadership and the culture and able to?
Duplicate that in a team setting and lead them motivate them.
Communicate, you can they do that if they can then the next level after that is, can this person find data pull it?
20:45
Proactively identify problems before they arise and solve them.
And I think that is the completely.
I mean, I could be wrong.
Maybe there.
I'm sure there's a hundred million dollar thing that I don't know about to get to 300 million.
But for right now that is the, that is the problem that I'm trying to tackle.
And I think that if I have that next step then it's really that completes the loop because if you think Think about it from the top.
21:05
This person sees the gold, we need to be seized the discrepancy, identifies them beforehand, and then tries to create Solutions around them before those problems arise, and then hands them over to the leadership leadership.
Hands it over to the management to make sure that the things get done and are tracked according and so that's the, that's the deal that's where I'm at.
21:27
And so, I hope that was right before you and I Drop a like if you thought this was good, leave a review on the podcast if you enjoy these things because it helps me know what type of content you guys like?
And I will try to make more of that stuff but at the other day I try and just document the journey that we're going to.

I have an amazing day.
Guess who's back?
Drop a like if you thought this was good, leave a review on the podcast if you enjoy these things because it helps me know what type of content you guys like?

I have an amazing day.
Guess who's back?

Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
You already know how to do it when you need to do it.
You do do it.
It.
So why aren't you doing?
Welcome to the game where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:38
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What I wanted to talk to you about today was I have the tiger so I just had our like, a 3-day Mastermind type thing with the top seller.
So, two or three gyms who came here, were over seven figures and the other one is going to probably hit it within the next three months.
0:55
So it's really, it was great because it's really higher-level, conversation that I might typically have With a much worse, which is fun.
And what we talked about was kind of more amorphous, but I think it's incredibly valuable, and I think it's probably the one thing that sets apart, the guys who are really winners / gals, who are really winners and the ones who aren't and so it's really just around hunger.
1:17
And what I mean by that, is we like, if recently I had some of our, some of our older OGG Amor, it's been a while, you know, I mean, they they they turn their gym around the throne there.
You know, you know, close to seven figures or right around there.
1:32
And they've been doing it for a while and they were complaining about show really.
Hey, our show rates are low and you know, you go through the sand while you're doing the reminders are doing all this above all?
Yeah, we're doing all this up.
Okay, cool.
And I did a little bit deeper and I look and it turns out that they're only open one hour per day.
1:51
At 7:15, a.m. for their availability.
Availability for new clients.
And I'm like, how the fuck do you think that you're going to grow your business?
If the only time that you can take new customers is that 7:15 a.m. like in what world does that make sense, right?
2:09
Like imagine a grocery store that's only open from 7:00 to 7:30 because that's when it's convenient for the owner.
Like what chance do you think that that that grocery store has at succeeding virtually none.
And so what happens is people have success.
2:26
They implement Tactics.
They use Jim watch and then they make money, right?
And then what happens, they get comfortable, they get complacent, right?
And they lose their hunger.
And so, all that's like, after that point everything, like it's almost, like, almost like after you after you, like, quote, made it in your mind and that's what's funny is that making in some people's mind is like having ten Grand in the bank account.
2:47
So, like, it's scary in terms of what level of making it is.
But like, once people have made it, I almost want to say, like, none of these tactics matter, because you're just not hungry, like it is.
A matter, like the obvious shit you aren't doing, you know what I mean?
Like, Like I'm trying to like wrap my head around it.
3:05
Like if you were if your child was going to die or your spouse or your significant other, your family member, whatever it was right was was going to die unless you succeeded, unless you've got more clients unless you made more money with your gym.
How would you approach it right?
3:22
Would you only be available for one hour a day?
Would you only be available from 7 to 8 a.m. right?
Would you?
Would you would you only set aside an hour a day to prospect for Nick?
Customers would you only reach out to your customers if they hadn't shown up for a month?
3:38
like, Like sometimes people ask questions that they already know the answer to, it's like duh no shit, right?
And it goes back to the, the main thing, which is like, what drives you, I think, what drives you, what drives you to be better, what drives you to continue to want to win.
3:56
And, you know, I was asked that question yesterday by the gym owners that were here, and I think, honestly, it comes from a dark place.
And I think I've said this before, but, like, I'm saying it again, because I think people need to hear it, like, like, sometimes you have to wonder like why is it that only when someone else's life is on the line, right?
4:19
Do you then actually try right?
Like why is it only then you actually cut all the noise out of your life and then would go laser focused on actually succeed, like why can't we do that all the time, really?
Why can't we do that?
Because it's like, well, then I wouldn't be happy whatever, right?
4:36
Like whatever happiness means right.
And so, like the people who are the most successful, What in the world are driven by something that is deep inside of them.
That is normally it insecurity or fear of some sort.
If you are only trying to make enough to live on, you will always only make enough to live on and you will slack the moment you get comfortable and you will wonder why is it that?
5:02
As soon as I start making money, I stopped because you actually don't want to make four That's why you actually don't want to make.
And so your internal motivation is not there but because you've accomplished what you set out to accomplish.
And so the real question is, do you actually want what you claim to want right?
5:22
Do you actually want it?
Because if you did, you'd already have it.
You'd already.
You'd already be willing to sacrifice other things in order to achieve it.
And that might mean like maybe waking up earlier maybe you like working for to 8 p.m. to take sales appointments or whatever that thing is.
Is right?
5:38
But like, it's just the obvious shit.
Like, if you were coaching you, what would you recommend you to do, right?
Like, a lot of times, if you think about it, like, You most of the time, know what to do like you do on some level.
5:54
Like like you probably know that you're like, man, I do stupid shit sometimes, right?
You probably think that on some level sometimes, right?
Then you like men, if I were, if you could step out of yourself and say I need to coach myself, you probably have the answer, right?
6:10
And it's just that you don't do it for some reason.
And so, all of your attention should be on that reason.
Why is it that this thing?
Preventing me from doing the things that I already know I should do.
Right?
Most like this last Master my that I had served for the top sellers was really interesting for me because it was the first time that had no one who had extra shit.
6:29
I didn't have any, like everyone.
There had really like clean lives outside like really focused and just focused on doing the things that we're gonna grow their business.
And so the conversations are actually really easy and very direct most times.
It's like, okay, well here's the obvious hole in your business.
6:48
Yes, but you're not doing anything about it.
So let's attack why you're not doing anything about it, right?
And so then I have to spend the next hour and a half digging into why they're not doing anything about it.
Which has much more to do with, how they manage their head space and how they manage their relationships and how they manage their, you know, because what ends up happening, is they start focusing on the business, the personal life goes to shambles and then they then are like, oh my gosh, my personal life is going to shambles, I need to stop paying attention to my my business, they go to patients of their personal life and their gym explodes.
7:18
Right?
It's just this consistent cycle because they just don't know how to just do both right or they don't know how to prioritize.
And so all this to say like, It's just like how hungry are you like how willing are you to put in what you need to achieve like and if you're not then that's cool.
7:37
Then just to stop stop saying you want.
Yeah.
I mean, just be like, I only want to make ten thousand dollars a month.
That's it.
It's like cool.
Then just say that and be good with it rather than constantly complaining about how you're not.
Because you're not even willing to do the things that that you already know you should do like, like, right now.
7:56
I get on the phone with Jim owners, the like I know I should work, my leads harder, I know, I know I should go through the sales trainings.
More like I know I should, you know, go through the portal.
I know I should I know I should meet with my team or I know I should form a like then why aren't you?
Hey guys, real quick.
For those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans, I love you.
8:14
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers, make more money.
You can get it by going to acquisition.com.
8:31
Leads it so free in exchange for your email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller leads and so that you can not miss out on it because last time I sold out for like eight straight weeks really fast.
So that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
Why aren't you and why it?
8:49
Why?
Like I know like I know you have time because other people have time and had the same business as you so you have time.
So why aren't you right?
And it's like what?
Like because once you have the tactics, right?
And this is one of the biggest, the freeing and also most soul-crushing parts of Jim Lynch is that once, once, once a geometer joins Jim launch, you know how to make a seven-figure jet.
9:12
You know how to do it and so, then it reflects back onto you, it's like, oh shit.
I'm the reason that we're not there and you have to swallow that red because up until they go to gym, lot of people been doing it for five years or seven years, eight years and they're like, I don't know how and then once they see how then they're like oh shit, I'm not sure if I'm willing to do that.
9:34
It's like cool now but once they know that there is no secret, there is no hack.
It's literally like microphone was, he uses the term chopping wood?
Like I call doing the boring work is like chopping wood.
It's reps is day in day out, you got to reach out to people, right?
You gotta give great service.
9:49
Right?
The handwritten cards like remind people to weigh in.
You have to work the leads.
When the person comes in the door, you have to be enthusiastic, got a green with a smile.
You have to ask the same questions over and over and over again because to that person is the first time they've ever heard right?
10:04
And it doesn't matter if it's the hundredth time that month, you asked the same questions that person to that person, stay warm.
And so, if you were trying to be successful, do you think that only having availability for sales appointments, at 7:15 to 7:45 in the morning once?
A day is going to get you the optimal outcome.
10:23
Do you need a coach to tell you that?
Really, you know what I mean?
Like really and and so like, or there is another one that's all that was like between 9 a.m. and 11 a.m. that, was their availability like, hmm.
Good luck with that.
10:40
That's when that's when the people who have the most money are available, right?
I know what during the week.
So like we know what to do, right?
Anyone who's in our world like you know what to do?
It's just you have to figure out why you're not doing it, right?
And then attack that because the To start the thing, right?
10:57
The tactics are there you can read a book and give it away for free, right?
Like you can do that, but like, figure out why you're not hungry, figure out why you're not like, why you're not trying.
They just figure it out.
Like there might be something inside meeting don't want.
And like, you need to discover that, it's like, okay then, like, don't know.
11:15
But like if you claim to want more and yet you can't do what's necessary to get more.
Then that's where your attention should go.
And you should figure that out because otherwise it doesn't matter what tactics there are you're just not going to do them anyways.
So what's the point right?
11:32
So anyways it was incredibly refreshing to have the three guys who are out here.
We had attorney microphones, both those guys have been over, you know, some figures roommates for a while.
I do really, really well and, and Aaron Aaron Stafford, just started inside of three, hundreds of people in his first six weeks, I did like 80,000 dollars and something sales and six weeks which prequel.
11:55
So any of those guys were just like what do I need to do?
Like that because they like their clear ice, you know, toes forward know exactly what to do.
And I was like, why is it that these meetings are so much easier than some of the other meanings I had?
And so, he's probably spent a little bit of the day kind of digging into that.
12:11
And it's just a question of how about you want it.
I really think that's it and like, figuring out why you're not doing, what you already know you should do in order to achieve it.
Like do you need to go pay someone?
A bunch of money in order to then get motivated.
12:28
I don't know.
Like hopefully your kid doesn't need to be kidnapped in order for you to get motivated by your business hopefully, right.
And so it's like, what, what is that thing for me?
It's just fear.
It's just fear and insecurity fear failing, fear of, not being good enough, fear of people, who hated to be right.
12:44
You know what I mean?
That's what my fear and so I did just like that's what drives me.
It's not about money.
It seems like it's it couldn't have been about money because I don't need any more for the rest of my life, like at all.
So I guess it can't be about that.
If it is like about that for you and you feel like when you make your first twenty thousand dollars take home with your first 40,000 or take a month to First 50,000, 100,000 or take a month.
13:02
But first time you hit that like if that's where you're like, oh and you feel this big sigh of relief, then your motivation is not coming from the right place.
I'm time, I'm telling you straight up.
If you feel relief, when you make a lot of money, when month, your motivation is not coming from the place of a champion. if you want to be the best in the world at something, that's not going to do anything for you.
13:23
You shouldn't feel anything from them.
And so, What do you feel to feel nothing?
Really because it's not about that.
That's just that's just an output.
That's an output from internal efforts and should be focused more on the internal efforts and all of the deficiencies that you probably had in still hitting 100K.
13:44
It's like, oh my gosh, if we hadn't done this, this, and this, we would have been less, right?
And if we had done this in, this would have been more like, that's what you're focusing on, and you're only focusing on those things.
And if you can do that, then you'll be able to unlock something.
Side of you.
That's much stronger than what might currently be driving.
14:03
So anyways guys, hope you have an amazing Saturday.
Drop a like if you feel like this is cool, drop a comment.
If you like it was cool if you don't, then that's cool too.
So anyways, guys have an amazing day and I will catch you guys soon.
Hopefully, that was valuable for somebody who is on the fence, who's like not sure about why they can't achieve what they want, why they can't be consistent because your motivation is not coming from the right place, right?
14:26
You're just trying to make enough money to live on and the moment. you make enough money, you stop working and then you wait for things to blow up again until you try her again and it's like it's like it's not How many times?
All right, I'm going on.
S little ramp.
14:41
How many times have you needed to make money?
And then immediately made the amount of money that you need it in like a day in like a week, right?
Need to make payroll, I got make 10 grand in the next three days.
Howdy how many times has that happened to you and you always make it work?
Why?
14:57
Because you already know what the fuck to do, right?
You just choose not to do it.
You choose not to do it.
You choose not to make money when, you know, how to make money because whenever you need to make money, you make it.
And so That's what you have to attack, you have to figure out why when you already know how to make money, you don't do it.
15:13
That's the that is the that is the the summary of this entire this entire talk, that was trying to get out of myself.
As like you already know how to do it when you need to do it, you do do it.
So why aren't you doing?
That is what you need to focus on.
And if you can conquer that piece, no amount of money in the world will satisfy you.
15:33
And that is what's going to unlock, your ability to become greater and for you to build your business, too.
I think that is much greater than yourself because if the only thing that you want to satisfy his you you're going to see this small that you can see this big because to satisfy a single person or a single family, doesn't mean a lot, right?
15:51
But if you want to satisfy Community, want to satisfy state must satisfy Nation.
You want to satisfy entire group of people?
It has to be bigger than you and so yeah.
So is hopefully that might resonate with somebody.
If it didn't then I apologize for the extra aggressiveness on this Saturday morning.
16:07
But Anyway.
Stop like Drop comment and I'll ask whatever.
I'll get you guys on the flip side.
Alright.








0:00
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into.
0:16
And if not keep enjoying the show, my margin for error, continues to shrink, welcome to the game, where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Hey, what's going on everyone?
Happy Thursday.
0:31
Hope you guys are having a good second half of the week.
I wanted to bring up a habit that I think is Central to being successful and its really, really really, really, really not sexy.
And I like the more I think about it.
0:49
There's so many other pieces that flow into this single habit and when I observe people who, you know, are doing better than I am and whatnot.
They usually have this really dialed in and the reason that no one does it is just because it's so freaking hard.
1:04
All right?
And it all revolves around energy.
And so what I mean by that is how to maximize your output as an entrepreneur.
It's the end of the day, like all we have is ourselves.
And so, that's why so many entrepreneurs are obsessed with increasing their their personal fruit, but like, how much they can produce right, you know, myself included and probably you and a lot of us.
1:27
Started on this path and wanted to increase our output by getting in shape.
And so when we were younger or whatever, you know, whatever we had that moment in our lives were like, you know what?
I'm going to start taking control of my life.
I'm going to start controlling what I eat.
I'm going to start working out, drinking water, all that kind of stuff, right?
And I think that there are levels to creating clear output.
1:46
And so an easy example of this is like if you've if you've been on a, you know, work out kick right, for a while or you've been training for a long time if you ever stopped raining and stop eating, The way that you've now grown accustom, all of a sudden, you feel sluggish and foggy and unclear, right?
2:03
You're like, man, I feel terrible, right?
And I also think that as we get older and I'm not saying I'm old, but just as I've I personally had gotten older, my margin for error continues to shrink right.
Like the amount of my wiggle room on fucking this up has gotten smaller and smaller and smaller, which is why I think very genuinely, the reason people many times, drink less, and less as they get older is because they simply Can't recover from it.
2:29
I think that people would drink as much as they could, as much as they did in college as adults, if they could bounce back from it, like they did when they were 18, right?
That's just a pure theory of mine but I don't think that humans fundamentally changed.
I think that the equation of cost and benefit changes and that is what changes their behavior, right?
2:46
And so the, the single habit of the single routine and I'm going to get to it, it changes and affects everything in your life, which is why it's so hard, right.
It's once, Singular habit, that affects how you eat, who you see where you go, all of that into one thing and that happiness sleep.
3:07
All right?
And I know that's like man, is that anti-climactic is Alex going to talk about sleep?
I am and I think it's because as entrepreneurs we need to be able to monitor our energy levels in order to succeed.
And I know this sounds like a really boring topic, but I'm telling you every single person who makes a ton of money that I know, Has a super dialed in Sleep System so it's not about like everybody talks about daily routines.
3:33
All the shit I've seen a zillion or teens, I personally don't really have one.
Like, I've seen all of, you know, some people attribute, their success, to the fact that they do X Y and Z.
Like I just think it comes down to being able to have energy and be maximum your output.
Now, the reason is trickles to everything is because if you always like to sleep, well, you have to pretty much go to sleep at the same time every day, and you have to wake up at pretty much the same time every day.
3:57
And you also can't do things to impair your sleep.
And so, here's the trickle-down effects of that, it means that when you travel your change time zones, it fucks with you, right?
If you drink and go out it fucks with you if you normally go to sleep during the week at 9 and go to sleep on the weekends at 11:30 it Fox with you.
4:15
Your body doesn't know about weekends or weekdays just knows about how your body supposed to feel, right?
And so I think what a single thing that we can like for me that has helped Because I'm not, I'm really bad at doing things on earth, like repeatedly.
4:31
I'm really bad at it.
But one thing that has helped me is is having a bedtime more than a wake-up time, right?
When I screenshot my wake up at 4:00 in the morning, it's not because I have an alarm that goes off.
It's just because I wake up, right?
And so I think it's much better.
4:48
Like, it's not it's not worth trying to cut your sleep to 5 hours so that you can wake up at 4:00 like.
That's not the game, it's not sustainable and you're also going to be stupider like There's all the data in the world shows that when you don't sleep much, you are Dumber, right?
You get fatter, you're hungrier, you're Dumber.
5:04
Your slower you have lower processing power.
You have were short term memory.
All of those things are affected and is entrepreneurs of the Holy thing that we have is our brains in the decisions we make like its tax.
All the chips against you.
Right?
You're also more emotionally reactive, right?
Your you have less control in that your prefrontal cortex because you don't have enough sleep, right?
5:23
I'm sure there are some times that you've woken up or a me at least where I've woken up and I'm like, man, there's Really nothing that could bother me today, like I feel awesome, right?
And I think it's really about how can we recreate that environment, that mental soup of, feeling on a consistent basis?
5:39
And what are the prerequisites that?
And this is why it's hard and this is why it's so hard because there are so many things that I do not do simply because of my sleep, right?
People invite me out all the time for dinner at 7:00.
Well, I'm in bed by 8:30 or not so it's not going to work.
5:57
If it's a 30-minute drive there you know that means that I have to leave the dinner at pretty much ate, right?
So I can go there on my drive 30 minutes to get there for one hour dinner Drive 30.
Like I'm not going to do that, right?
And so there's a lot of social occasions that I can't go to or I have to leave early from right and it seems lame.
6:15
And it's hard, right?
It's hard to do that.
It's hard to do to not go out on the weekends and change my schedule because everyone else does, right?
And even a lot of entrepreneurs do it doesn't mean that they're bad.
It's just their different, right?
Hey Mose, a nation quick break.
6:31
Just to let you know that we've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright so send me a connection request.
A note.
Let him know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
6:50
And so, a couple of takeaways run.
This, at least for me is that every entrepreneur that I know those super successful has dedicated time where they're uninterrupted every day, and that to me, means you're either staying up, really late.
Or you're waking up really early.
I actually, if you think about it from a lifestyle standpoint, I think it might be easier to stay up really late, because it allows you to have a little bit more of a social life and then you can still have your work time afterwards.
7:17
If you're disciplined enough to do that.
I wish I could do that.
Even in college, I never worked past 9 p.m. like I did it.
I'm just like, I'm shocked.
Like I just, that's how I function personally.
And so I always I was always the guy who'd be like, you know, I'd be stopped working at 9:00.
7:32
And then I would wake up at three or four and then I would start working and because I just knew I was useless, right?
And so for me because of how my body works, it's kind of less convenient for me which has been it's taken a toll on a lot of things in my life.
And that's why it's a big trade-off and most people aren't willing to make it with their actions, right?
7:49
Like the trade-off of not drinking, right?
Because it impairs my sleep.
Most of the time is hard right now.
There's trade-offs, you know, if you go to a wedding or it's your wedding or you know, whatever it is.
But like then just understand the trade off.
The thing is, is the lower the barrier is when you make that trade-off, the more likely it is to happen all the time, right?
8:06
And then, all of a sudden you're drinking because it's Taco Tuesday, right?
And so, you know, it's kind of like the weight loss Pioneer.
So close a special occasion Donuts are on Wednesdays.
Like, you know, at some point you have to draw a line.
And for most people, they don't have the discipline and so they have to go.
Go all or nothing and myself included.
8:21
I spent two and a half years where I didn't drink anything.
Right.
We've started a drink a little bit more.
Now, try and try and balance things.
I think that the ultimate goal is to be able to have things and not be to use things and not be used by them, right?
And so to bring this all to a head, right weekends, right?
8:42
Not changing your schedule on the weekends.
Huge incredibly difficult.
Not going out during the weekdays.
All on social events that I know are going to get me jacked up emotionally, or adrenaline or whatever.
So that when I get home, I have to spend another hour unwinding to get to bed at a later time, right?
9:00
And so, I think the single habit, at least, for me that's been game-changing has been always allowing myself to sleep as much as necessary or as much as my body needs, but focusing more on my bedtime, right?
And by doing that, it does rule out a lot of activities in my life and that is hard.
9:19
Like, it's really hard for me.
Like, I'm a social person, I like seeing people, but I can't a lot of times.
And it also means that I can't travel as much as I would normally like to because when I go across time zones, it really messes with me.
And so, a lot of times when I go across times, I try and keep the same sleep schedule.
9:36
So when I was in Southern California, I was waking up at like 2:00 or 2:00 2:30 in the morning because it was two hours behind our sir to Howard, yes, two hours behind my Austin time.
So I tried to change as little I could, which means that I was like going to sleep at, like 7:00 or 7:30 is nuts, right?
9:53
And that means all the people that were accepting property were like, we'll do.
Let's hang out and like, I'm in bed.
They're like, seriously, it's 7.
And I'm like, I don't study, you know, and that's hard.
It's shitty.
And I'm not saying it's the best way, I'm just saying, I think that when I look at a lot of people who are really successful, they have this one aspect dialed in and it has so many ramifications the rest of their lives because you can't have any kind of Habitual.
10:19
Habits or output.
If the one thing that starts or ends your day is variable, right?
And so I think that, if you can make that piece a foundation, a Cornerstone of how you live, then you always have as much energy and clear, you know, Clarity and you will be able to make better judgment and better decisions.
10:41
And I know this is definitely not like a hey, here's how to close a credit card, over the phone and three minutes type of tactic but I can't tell you how important I really truly think it is and how I can witness this character trait or rather, you know, human Habit in the people were successful than people were down.
10:58
And I think it's because it requires other characteristics.
You have to have discipline, you have to have be able to, to make trade-offs.
You have to really be able to prioritize the things that are important to life and those are all skills that some people don't have.
And so if you can do that, then you have to ask yourself, is this thing worth the trade-off of me being at 100% tomorrow versus 80%.
11:15
And I think that that 20% extra is what compounds over time.
And what separates Kobe Bryant from the rest of the NBA.
Because he always took that 20% again and again, and again, and again.
And then within five years, the difference is that the Gap is so wide.
11:30
That no one can catch up with you.
So I know this was less of a tactical one.
I just it, it's so important to me because I've it's changed the way I live my life and when people to Juneau me or like, oh yeah, all my friends, like out past your bedtime, right?
And I take those, you know, I take this slags.
11:47
And you know, I take those body punches It's because it's true.
You know what I mean?
And it's a trade-off and it hurts because I don't you know like to see people and they're like well I can't do anything before that.
And I'm like well then I guess we can hang out and so and like I have those real conversations honestly all the time and so I guess I'm saying this to say if you have been struggling with maintaining, you know, the routine or a specific habit because everyone around you is not in support of it.
12:14
I think it's welcome to the club and I think it's just are you willing to make that trade-off for what you want?
And I just never want to look back on my life and be like, well, I'm glad I went to Taco Tuesdays, rather than getting what I wanted out of life.
So, anyways, I thought I'd share that with you, so that if you are struggling with it, I don't think it gets easier.
12:32
I think it's still just as hard for me now as it was before, but I think I'm just more used to it.
And I've kind of trained my surroundings, the people who are around me in my life, they just know that this is a trade-off.
I'm not willing to Make when 99% of humanity is willing to make that trade and I think that separates the 1% from everyone else.
12:51
So anyways have an amazing Thursday of those useful for you and keeping awesome.
And I'll catch you guys soon.
Make when 99% of humanity is willing to make that trade and I think that separates the 1% from everyone else.
So anyways have an amazing Thursday of those useful for you and keeping awesome.
And I'll catch you guys soon.








0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll, 80%, or more of our clients have come in after consuming, multiple pieces of content.
0:23
Welcome to the game, where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures.
And lessons, we have learned along Along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Hey was going everyone.
Happy Friday, I'm stuck in traffic and I was super alert so I figured I would make something what was on my mind, which putting together the pieces of the acquisition machine.
0:44
So the last I would say, my focus for the last few months has been on the difference between inputs and assets and so that means is like assets being one time things that once I build them they can continue to provide value over time and then Puts our once.
1:00
I create this machine, what are the inputs that are required to make the machine go, right?
So an example would be building a car.
The inputs are really a driver and gasoline, right?
That's kind of the example, you know, how to add a basic level, right?
And so, when you're thinking about, at least for me, when I'm thinking about acquisition, I know that there are certain beliefs that I need someone to have in order to become a customer.
1:22
Right?
And so it's kind of interesting is we just did a big data review of the people who've been coming on to sign up for gym launch and interestingly Lee 80%, or more of our clients have come in after consuming, multiple pieces of content, which makes sense because people are skeptical and, like, to consume multiple things to make sure that, you know, whatever they're buying is legit.
1:43
And only 20% bought directly from an advertisement which was really interesting for me because it means my advertising is really only scooping up the after-effects of what our content is doing.
And I've always, I mean, I've been making videos and podcasts and you know, Eddie's Or he's taught for years without any real tracking for our.
2:04
Oh, I just I kind of did it for me, but there are o ICP definitely there.
And so, when I'm thinking about this because nothing about in really structured format, what are the stories that someone needs to hear camera for the West become an ideal Prospect?
2:19
Right?
And so, in one of my trainings, I talked about having a story bank and this.
I got this from Dan Kennedy and he talks about having all of the key stories.
Is that were the things that broke your beliefs along the path, to becoming who you are, right?
2:35
And so, when you're selling a prospect who's coming in, in a quarter miles, use the Lakota technobabble e stuff of like, this is what the training is.
This is the macros, this is the workouts, right?
And then you lose them because they don't care.
And that's ultimately not how you actually were sold into the change to begin with.
2:50
Right.
Right.
And so what's important, or at least what I found is important is when I was selling Fitness, just as much as we're selling Jim launch versus, you know?
Now we're left too late.
To turquoise is one of the key stories that shift in perspective.
And so, as an example, for Fitness, if I'm talking about accountability, I would continue for 12 miles of streets point.
3:10
I would say, Hey, you know, do you remember when you were a kid and you want, you were to go to bed at night and your parents that hey, you have to brush your teeth and you were like, no, I don't want to brush my teeth and they're like, no, you have to brush your teeth and then finally go to, you know, go and brush your teeth and go to bed, right?
And they did that every single night with you and now you're an adult and you probably by sure.
3:29
Teeth.
Don't you right?
Right.
And so the goal here is to get you from having somebody externally motivating.
You to some to you having that internal motivation because of the Habit that has been established, right?
And so that's a simple, Epiphany, Bridge story of why accountability would work.
Another story for the same concept would be, alright, have you heard of The Amazing Race?
3:46
It's a show where they draw people in the middle of an island.
And then they all have to find some other place not using conventional, you know, means and they actually had a couple that one so many times that they had to change the rules of the game because Because of what they were doing and you want to know what they were doing, what they were doing is every time they get dropped off to some whatever place.
4:06
They would actually find a local, put them in the back seat, and then have them guide them and direct them be like, oh no, there's a shortcut here over.
Got, you know, don't worry about that.
Pothole.
Oh, there's traffic on, you're always right.
And so, they had the inside knowledge, that would get them to shortcut their speed to success, right?
4:22
And so because of that, you can understand why coaching is such an important part, because it's going to short track your path to success.
And so, These things.
These key stories are the things that I think you put inside of your Arsenal.
And when you're selling a prospect for each of the key points that you have within your program, whatever it is right.
4:38
Finished attrition accountability.
Each of those should have key stories that you can relate to.
If you see the person is not resonating with it, right?
If they're not understanding the value, you have to meet them back to where you were before, you had that Epiphany and then walk them through the story itself.
4:54
And going through this process, I can't tell you how viable it's been because it creates the stories that stick and they become part of the stories of the community.
Your trainer start talking about them, your coaches start talking about them because no one remembers the program of the macros, but they remember the stories and depending on, you know, whatever your belief system is independent of whatever your belief system.
5:12
Is every major religion in the entire world.
If you believe that God did this, he put all of them into a book of stories.
Why would the most powerful, you know, person in the universe of all time?
Use a book of stories to be the thing to persuade and break beliefs, literally building belief systems, most Nation real quick.
5:39
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can fly anywhere on the page.
And talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
5:59
And so, if you think about that and how powerful that is, I've I've inventoried about two and a half years ago, I inventoried all the stories that I have and I've got three hundred stories that I tell to illustrate different points, How We Do assume closes, how I discovered, how people are willing to pay more for one time than they are for recurring client?
6:16
Find a sec.
Was it all these things have how I stumbled upon these.
And what I would I'm telling you it's one of the best exercises you can ever do.
For building a sales deck, for every aspect of your business is putting the Or he's together on paper and putting the cues for what it is.
6:32
The story is supposed to break the belief for, and if you do that this huge Arsenal that you can always put to work for story selling, all right.
So big picture.
I'm doing this right now.
I'm practicing my ability to tell stories in different formats.
6:47
Both visual with words and with audio.
Ideally not multitasking.
But when you do it like that, there's 14 steps to every story.
I've probably read expert Secrets, eight times.
Now just in the last three or four months and it's because I really want to practice getting good at telling stories.
7:07
Only people stories, like the back of my hand.
I want to be able to say it.
Like I'm breathing it, right?
And so it's already paying off in dividends for me in a number of ways, which I'll get into in another podcast.
But especially when seeing the, the amount that somebody has to consume, more likely, is doing to consume before they do business with us especially in a lower.
7:28
Trust environment, having those stories and consistently weaving them into the presentations that you're giving can ultimately create the belief in that customer.
That's the beliefs that that's aligned with who you want to work with.
So, anyways, I hope that was right before you just very top of mind, right?
For me right now which is building the story bank and weaving them together so that you can alternately break the beliefs or someone so you can actually change their lives.
7:50
So I hope that was all before you hope that made sense and you guys have an awesome Friday.
Lots of love, as always and I'll catch you guys soon.
Bye.








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
Right now, if you're a gym owner or you're in an industry, that was affected by covid.
Shit sucks.
Welcome to the game, where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer, and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:42
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Hey, what's one?
Everyone just wanted to make this video for our / Podcast manager, consuming it just I feel like you needed to be said so.
Right now, if you're a gym owner or you're in an industry, that was affected by covid.
1:01
Shit sucks.
Right?
I just want to be really real with you like shit sucks.
Like it's not easy.
And if you're, you know, in the gym space and you kind of have two choices, right?
You've got your lease that you personally, guaranteed, you've got equipment, you've got, you've got employees that are relying on you and it's half.
1:25
The market doesn't want to come into your gym.
They're afraid of, you know, the the flu, right?
And on the flip side, you're trying to make money online but it's an entirely new business.
And so, any new business would require 100% of your attention.
Except you also have this other business that you're personally, guaranteed on that is also puttering by at 50% capacity, and it's very, very difficult to acquire customers, right?
1:46
That's just reality, right?
That just is what it is right now.
And if you've heard any of the podcast I've ever made, it's all about focusing on One thing, but how do you focus on one thing?
When you've got something that you're personally guaranteed on one side and you've got something on the other side that requires 100% your attention and have to learn all new skills, onboard new employees deal with an entirely new fulfillment structure, new fulfillment, system new acquisition process, right?
2:12
Like how do you do that?
You just try your fucking best, right?
You just try your best.
There's there's really no, I have no sex like really great answer.
I could tell you that the people that are succeeding are going in overdrive.
You know, they're working 16 hours a day.
2:28
They're working weekends and they're doing it to try and get enough of a leg up enough of Advantage, enough of a head start in one of those games so that they can let the other game go.
And I was talking to a really good friend of mine who's a really, really prominent life coach.
And she said something that I really liked and I thought I'd share with you which is it's much less about the habits that were trying to make and far more about the person that we want to be and whenever you have to switch your identity, there's always an element of risk because you have to sacrifice something old in order for the new to exist.
3:03
And so for many of us, there's an identity, there's belief sets, there's belief patterns that we have Associated that we've been walking in, for a long period of time, and we have to make the decision of who we want to be right, what's?
Story, will we tell about these hard times at first, we thought it was going to be a week or two weeks, or three weeks or a month or two months or three months.
3:22
And now it's what 2/4 3/4 a year, right?
Like at the end of the day, we can only deal with, like we have the cards that are dealt to us and we can only play the hand we've got.
And so I'm just making this because like shit's hard for us to, you know what I mean.
3:38
It's it's incredibly emotionally draining 22.
See, you don't know.
Mean like seeing gyms go out of business left and right and some people are going out because they can make it and they turn the corner online.
And some guys are going out because they just can't turn the corner fast enough and they only have 30 days of cash, right?
3:58
And like I said, it's reality.
And I wish I could I could wave a magic wand and give everybody, you know, 90 days of cash, like you did.
When you started your gym, right?
You probably had some sort of preparation, but you didn't have preparation for starting an entire new, you know, online business and you.
4:14
Got it within seven days and you still had bills and you still had rent, and you still employees, and you still have payroll and you still had everything else was Associated?
Maybe you got the loan from the government?
Maybe you didn't, right?
What the fuck you gonna do, right?
He's got to play the cart unit.
Got to play the cards were dealt.
4:32
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
4:48
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I catch the partner with you so that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show. and so I'm just saying this because like if it feels hard It's the game.
5:08
You know what I mean?
And the game can't be won.
Only played and so maybe maybe your chapter changes.
Maybe the story changes for you.
In terms of the industry you're in, maybe maybe your entire business model changes, maybe you go from group 2, one-on-one, maybe you go from group to sell my privates, maybe you go from groups online.
5:26
Maybe you go from a big facility to one-on-one, right?
You got to play the strengths that you've got, if you know that you're good in this setting then play your strengths because right now, that's what you've got.
Those are the cards you have.
Those are the ones that you have in the pocket, right?
And the cards that are dealt on the table or for everyone.
All right?
But the thing is, is that the one nice equalizer is that everyone was dealt the same hand, right?
5:46
Everyone in our industry, anybody in brick-and-mortar service specifically, you know, in health and wellness was dealt the same hand and so there are people winning.
And so if you have the belief that if that fucker can do it, so can I, you will be able to push through it, right?
And I'm only saying this because that's what I have to tell myself, right?
6:05
And I'm just saying, it's hard, right?
It's hard.
Hear that I hear the customer support calls, right?
I hear the people were like, well, how am I going to pay my rent?
For my house, and pay pay this and pay for marketing.
And the honest answer is, I don't know, right?
We try and put as many tools as we possibly can.
We give paid-in-full plays we play, we have cash plays.
6:22
We give 0 ad spend plays so you can do Outreach, right?
But at the end of the day, at some point, you're going to probably have to go into overdrive.
You're going to probably have to do an asymmetric amount of effort to make up for a deficiency that the market played.
Right.
We all got, you know, Op 27 off suit, right for anybody's in a poker right.
6:41
You got the worst hand that you can be dealt and so you got to just play it, right?
And that means that you got to make up for another way.
Is you got to make up for it in the strength.
You've got if you're good on 101, then do want to 1.
If you're good at high ticket to, I take it.
If you're if you're good at the marketing side, do the marketing side but what you can't do is just quit, you just can't give up because the game keeps going.
7:00
And the only thing that we have to do is get through the chapter because the page will turn eventually they will they will decide that it is okay for us.
To be in business.
It's okay for us to do what we're supposed to do.
But I'm just saying, like, I'm just, I'm half giving this message to myself as much as I am for you, which is like the only thing we can do is just try to do like try to start tomorrow, right?
7:22
And I'm just saying this because I saw a couple, you know, I've had a couple individual messages and a couple conversations that were around this topic and I just don't have a sexy answer.
Like I could tell you that when I would like when I first opened my first gym like, I contemplated why even felt like being alive, right.
7:40
I'd so much pressure.
I couldn't breathe.
I couldn't sleep even though I was exhausted because I was so stressed and it made no sense because I was like, how the fuck can I be so tired?
And I'm so I'm too tired to fall asleep right now because I have so much adrenaline and cortisol in my system because I've been amped up all day and drink.
7:55
So many caffeine drink so I could at least look like I was paying attention.
So I could look like I was building Rapport on my sales calls today, right?
And so like, if you're going through that, I'm just saying, like you're not alone, we're all going through it in our own flavor, but Play the cards that you've got.
Play your strengths taketake advances on cash.
8:13
So if you have opportunities to get someone who has cash for any kind of discount, you can front-load some of those give future discounts.
That's okay.
Because right now, you're going to be betting on the fact, like you are rolling a dice but we're betting on the fact that in six months, things will be better.
And I think that's a bet that I'm willing to make, right?
8:30
And so if you can get that cash to get you through this, if you can do some paid in full as if you can, if you can work with some clients to advance on it.
Ear right?
As long as you're still committed to playing the game and consider committed to fulfilling the promises that you make them, what you should be.
Then I'm I think that those are the types of small moves that you're going to have to make during this period of time, but we're all going to be on overdrive.
8:50
So if you feel like you're on overdrive and you're exhausted, Just got to keep going, right?
And I'm right there with you, you know, everyone at Jim Lunch.
Like we try and remove every obstacle you possibly can, I can't change the change the government.
I can't change what they allow us to do.
9:09
We can just fucking try hard and so that's what we've got.
So anyways, lots of loves everybody, hope you guys are having a good week.
If you're, if you're if you're struggling connect with other people, I can tell you there's always strengthen communities and connect with others and be able to get through this together, all right?

Welcome to the game, where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures.
And lessons, we have learned I've learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Good morning everyone, happy Sunday.
0:34
Hope you guys are rocking and rolling.
As we start the beginning of next week, I've been cranking out some work and I felt like I do next place to rest and I wanted to share two stories with you because they've just been on my mind a lot lately.
And they are the two most impactful experiences of my life, which is pretty bold playing because I feel like I've had a lot of pretty impactful experiences, but there are two decisions that I made in my life.
1:00
If that were by far the highest Roi decisions in terms of how much I was able to grow, as a result of them.
And both of them were in person, Mastermind experiences.
The first one was when I decided to join Russell's Inner Circle and so the back story behind this was, I was a gym owner, right?
1:25
I had six gyms at the time I was young I I understood a tiny amount, tiny bit about marketing, just enough to kind of get my gyms to work and I was actually in a pretty bad spot in my life.
I was just really don't know incredibly bored and I didn't really know anyone.
1:44
And so, the gyms were working and I had looked up after three years of not doing anything, but working in realize, like, I had nothing like LifeWise and so I just knew I wanted something different.
I didn't know what it was.
And so, I had seen Russell's Peek at traffic and conversion Summit like a year earlier and I just remember watching from present and I was like, this guy's really good.
2:06
I need to work with this guy and but he wasn't allowed to pitch so he never sold anything at the event.
He just literally did an entire webinar and then stop at the stack and was like, you know, just check us out if you think is interesting.
And so anyways, I Googled his name and the first thing he made him up was his Mastermind which was the most expensive thing has on his value ladder which is kind of hilarious.
2:28
So and so I applied and I got a call and honestly I had no business being invited to join his Mastermind from the application.
So this shows you like way back when before Russell was Russell Brunson he entered.
I mean like when he was I think they were doing maybe 10 million dollars a year at the time and you know, probably a third of that was his Mastermind and not the software.
2:50
But anyways, the sales guy was like, oh my God, you know, you'll love it here.
Like there's so many players and all the stuff And and so he sold it to me and at the time it was a tremendous amount of money for me.
I mean, it was pretty much all the money I had to join and so I wired all of it over because they didn't do payment plans or anything like that.
3:13
And the first call that I got with him, he got on the phone with me.
I told him everything that we were doing and he kind of pause for a second was like you're really really good at this.
I was like thanks man.
He said first off If you need to speak at my event and I was like this guy was like, God to me, you know what I mean?
3:32
And I was like, holy shit.
Okay.
And so, I think the first thing that happened in my life like in terms of like the reason this this one experience was so pivotal to me, is that he said, the next thing he said to me was I think you have a love, attend skill set and a level 2 Opportunity.
I don't think you should be running James, I think should be teaching people how to run James and so that entirely shifted how I how I move forward in terms of my business.
3:56
The next thing is after I had my first 30-minute onboarding call with him.
I got put into the first event, which is like the next month for his inner circle.
And when I went there, I remember there was this guy who stood up and he just didn't seem that like motivated or ambitious or anything.
4:13
And he was just like, yeah, you know, we're doing like three hundred thousand a month and really need to, you know, improve our stuff.
And I was like blown away three hundred thousand a month, like, are you kidding me?
And I just I was dumbfounded But the thing is, I hung out with this guy and I hang out with these other guys during the breaks, and I was like, these guys are just normal dudes.
4:35
And so, when I, when I rub shoulders with these guys, I was like, I could do this, you know what I mean?
And so, there's three C's that I think came from this event for me, which was Clarity conviction, and community.
4:51
And so, I got Clarity on what I needed to do.
I had conviction that I could do it because I saw other people there that I didn't think we're better or smarter than I was, And then I had a community people around me and that kind of feeds into the conviction.
That I felt like, I could have support or take phone calls with, or whatever.
5:07
And I talked to everyone in the group, I had a one on one call with almost every person in his inner circle.
When I joined, I just reached out and was like, hey here's all the shit I'm good at and I just like, gave them everything I knew.
And they're like, is there anything I can do to help you?
And I was like, not really but I just wanted to meet you.
5:24
And so I got all this Goodwill from everyone else in the group.
And then later, as I would get Stuck at different points.
I knew what they were good at and then I'd reach out and they were like, yeah, dude, for sure.
And they hop on, they helped me get on stuff and so that that first experience that I had in his group was one of the like kind of defining moments for me as an entrepreneur.
5:44
The next one is after we kind of executed some of the first things after being in that group I think is probably nine months later we were doing probably 400,000 month ish and this is now not from the gyms but from me you know doing Jim Lunch.
Actually it does For you kind of service and we just pivoted to done with you and it kind of blew up your literally like the second month in a done with you and we did like 380 and so he said, hey, you need to come to this Pirate's Cove Mastermind and he's talked about this at some of his some of his content.
6:13
But the Pirates Cove Mastermind was I mean probably the single single big.
I mean the first one and this one are the two biggest.
Most impactful experience my life and when I went, there is invite only, it was ten thousand dollars and the only people invited We're doing eight figures or more and so there's 10 people there and I was one of them and I was not doing any figures and I was like why am I here?
6:36
And you just like I just think that you're good enough to be here and I think you're going to be there really soon.
And so it was again you just kind of believed in me and I was like this is awesome and when I got there definitely the room, the elevation of the room was definitely higher and every one of these people were people I had heard of, you know, me, like I knew all of them, it wasn't like up-and-coming, they were all established. and, When I got up and I presented what we were doing in our numbers, all that stuff, and I was like, this is what I think about doing and I want to sort of supplement company and all the stuff.
7:09
There's this guy named Jason flatly and who had done like 28 million dollars in a single day and it was just Wicked smart and he pulled me aside after my presentation it was like, if what you're saying is true, so you've got 100 million dollar company and I just like, I just remember like feeling like the air is sucked out of the room.
7:27
So I actually felt a lot of pressure.
I didn't feel really good.
Got it.
I just felt like tons of pressure because at that moment, Leyland, I was like, really enjoying life.
Like we just she and I, and I think I'd like one other employee and we were making so much money, you know?
I mean, it was just an uncomprehending full amount of money for us, you know?
7:44
I mean, we had like no overhead and we're doing three hundred thousand dollars plus take home every month and we had not made that kind of money ever.
And he's like, you need to scale up extremely fast, or someone is going to take everything you have and claim it for their own themselves.
And so, I felt this huge insecurity and fear.
8:00
That I was like, oh my gosh, I have to scale really fast and so I we went all-in.
And so we both put our heads down and sign up for like three or four more masterminds for different things.
Some for traffic, some for scaling, you know, your team's called collect everything we possibly could.
8:19
And from the little pieces, we were able to put together, we were able to rapidly grow from.
I think we did 380 than we did for a teething 1782.
Then we did a million that we do 1.2 then we do 1 Point 5, In like glitter.
That was the growth curve.
I mean, that was all in a six-month.
It was nuts.
It was insane.
8:35
And the reason I'm bringing this up is that both times like they were the second time was in a financial stretch but I'd never pay ten thousand dollar from no man that I'd never done.
You know me, I'd pay for masterminds, but not an event.
And even though everyone there was, you know, way above me, I'm still hooked on Grandma's.
8:53
Like that's kind of kind of steep, but since having those experiences one, when we have our And so I try and try and think about those three C's.
Just how can I recreate if you're doing stuff for your clients?
How can I recreate those three C's?
How can I recreate conviction Clarity and Community because I think in Live Events unless it's a workshop like a three-day Workshop, which really tactical most times.
9:15
Those are the biggest things you can get from an event.
But I also think that the most valuable, right?
You can Google how to, you know, how to do stuff like, that's not difficult, but it's just getting someone to believe that they can do it, knowing what they need to do from the clarity and then having the community there to trying to debug it'll neck and also kind of reinforce the conviction I think is one of the most valuable things and after going through those two experiences in my life, they are definitely in.
9:40
Probably to the stories that are referred to the most.
Those were things were I kind of transformed and I think that a lot of entrepreneurs, miss out on the highest Roi I've ever gotten has been from spending money to buy information by a mile like not I mean not even close the The the highest Roi has been buying information and so we consistently and I still do try and by courses that I see anything that's up-and-coming or interesting because I almost always get stuff from them and the amount that I get from them is always less than what I pay and I think part of that, it means you have to do stuff.
10:17
Look, guys.
You guys already know that.
I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you just leave review, but taking 10 seconds, or one type of the thump, it means the absolute world to me.
10:42
And more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
But beyond that, I had a woman who reached out to me recently.
And she said, I've wasted, you know, a hundred thousand dollars on masterminds in courses.
10:59
And I, you know, I can't get past five from thousand dollars a month online.
And I was like taking it back because I knew this person before she had invested in all of these courses and programs and all that stuff.
And she definitely wasn't making 500 a month.
Sorry a year.
11:15
And I was like, how can you say you wasted money like you invested in a lot of times, you don't get the whole picture.
Now we try and do the full stack as much as you know like as much as humanly possible.
Like the full stack end-to-end of lead generation nurture sales fulfillment scaling delivery everything, right?
11:34
But sometimes you don't get all the pieces from the same person, right?
I mean I can't tell you the amount of different things that we purchased and just because you don't immediately see an Roi doesn't mean that you didn't build another link.
The chain.
And so a lot of times I think that success is between, you know, where you're at to where you want to go and there's this bridge and the bridge is made of these bricks.
11:53
And each of those bricks is necessary, but you don't always get the bricks from the same people and so you learn how to write headlines and copy and then you learn how to, you know, make creative and then you learn how to place ads and by traffic and then you learn how to, you know, build funnels, and then you learn how to sell and then you learn how to improve your product and deliver an each of those things could be from different people, different courses that you consume, but I I can just like my biggest ask for anybody, who's listening is just that like invest in proximity.
12:23
I think it is the single.
Most powerful thing you can do is always try and buy your way into the next level, because when you do that, you will rub shoulders with people.
You will get clarity on what you need to do.
You will get the conviction that you can do it and you have the community to support you to make sure that you don't get stuck.
12:40
And I'm just telling you, like it is the height like if you like there's no point.
Is your unless you have a million plus in your bank account that you shouldn't be spending all of your money in my opinion on education, right on.
I'm not, I'm very against formal education.
12:57
I'm very Pro self education but education is the way.
Right?
And so I get messages and we were like, what investments are you in right now?
I'm like I still look at trying to buy stuff.
We're going to another Mastermind this week and now it's everybody.
There is that 100 million in a billion and there's two guys who are 50 and so we're going to be like the smallest cats The room.
13:15
And so I'm super excited for this.
But I'm saying this, because when you have those opportunities, do not pass them up because I felt a shudder to think what my life would be.
If I hadn't gone to these, if I hadn't made these kind of leap of faith decisions to join these.
13:32
These higher-level groups, and to pay for them, almost before I could afford them.
And in paying for them before I could afford them.
I think it enabled me to later afford the things that I could normally.
And so I know it.
It's guts.
I know it takes a leap of faith.
It does take some discernment to make sure that you're investing with the right people.
13:50
But almost always there's always something big that you can get from someone and it doesn't always need to be tactical.
Sometimes it's a belief set.
Sometimes it's a, it's a way that they treat things.
It's a way that they a perspective, but like there's always something really valuable especially from people who are doing more than you.
14:06
Like almost everybody who makes more money than you is doing something very well.
And if you just look at what it is, now they're gonna do everything really well but they might do.
Something very well and they have to be doing something because it's, they're doing better than you are.
And so I think if you can go into that perspective and always continue to invest, especially in proximity.
14:25
I think that you will, you will not think me, but you'll thank yourself for making the call.
Because for me, it's been, it's been the single most, the biggest contribution to where we're at right now has been the people that we've been able to find and Surround ourselves with, and people talk about it.
14:42
But I don't see nearly as many people taking An age of information because it's the only thing that can buy you time, right?
Like you can't buy time back but you can get the thing that gets things to go faster, right?
You can take the amount of time.
It takes you to achieve your success from 20 years to two years.
15:00
If you leverage five, other people's 20 years of experience in just apply their learnings, right?
Like, at the end of the day, you can either learn the learnings or you can pay for the learnings, right?
But you just have to.
You have to have the principal or the, where the belief set one way or another, it's either by ramming your head.
Or the wall or looking at somebody else who did and saying, cool, I'll not do that, I'll do this instead and I think that's how you can jump because you don't have the huge losses of time that come from failures, right?
15:25
You're going to fill them out of what you might as well minimize the amount of failures you have.
And I think proximity and learning from people who are better than you is by far Bar, None, the best thing I've ever done.
So anyways, I thought I'd make that for you because a lot of people don't know, you know, the things that we've invested in and those two things were the most impactful.
15:45
And I think it's really getting almost like you should be in rooms where you feel like you don't deserve to be there.
That's kind of my point.
Like, you should, you should walk into rooms and be almost in all of all the other people there and keep your mouth shut.
And just listen, you don't.
I mean, and the only other thing that I can say that it's been really valuable for me, that I don't see people doing is I was voted the most valuable Inner Circle member the first year, they had the award and they they didn't say they were going to have an award.
16:14
So it wasn't like I was doing it.
For it just like they just decided to have an award in anonymously.
Everyone wrote to me as the most valuable person and at the time I wasn't making the most money in the group, not even close and so, but I think what I was able to do was I literally gave everything I knew and at the time, I knew way more about sales that I did about marketing and so I just was like, hey, here's how we do our sales process, here's how we hear.
16:38
So we close here so we draw our teams because that was something that I had scaled, I had scale of sales team.
I had, you know, 68 guys who are selling for me at the time.
I didn't know shit about marketing but by showing you know all of these internet marketers who are really good at marketing and the tech stuff which I wasn't good at how we sold.
16:55
They all got a lot of value and apply our sales processes and our tactics and how we how we scripted things out and they started making money.
And I was just offering to help.
So I literally reached out to every person that I thought was cool, which was most of them because I just wanted to learn more about what they were doing because I almost inevitably got something back without Out, even asking.
17:16
And then later, I had an IOU and my pocket, not not doing it for that reason, but I did have Good Will.
And so when I was like, dude, I'm super stuck on this.
And when I started our supplement company, there's all these dudes that I helped in e-commerce that were like, dude, I hope you get all that stuff set up.
Thanks.
17:31
And sometimes it's not even them setting you up with a know a guy.
And so those things like not just the people but their networks I guess I got so much leverage so quickly that I think that was how we went from zero.
I mean, You know, figuratively zero dollars online to doing 10 million in collected cash in our first 10 months.
17:52
And to date from what I understand, I think that's the fastest growth that they've had that whole community.
And I think it was because it was like a double leveraged effective Goodwill.
So I found the best group that was above me.
I tried to provide as much as I could.
I did one of them calls with virtually everyone in the group.
18:09
Like looks like I was like, half my day.
I was on calls with people that weren't related to my business and I just try to give as much as I could.
And then they would always inevitably give back because givers always get back, right?
And that's what you'll see the higher up.
You go, the more people are givers and takers and so they would always give back and they poured into me.
18:25
And then by doing that I was able to just Leap Frog, you know, two, three, four, five, you know, different levels of growth in a very short period of time, you know, learning from their beliefs learning from their tactics learning from their setups, learning from how they set up their teams like all of those things.
18:41
And so I just want to say if you have the opportunity Rub shoulders with Giants and rub shoulders with people who are way above you.
I truly do not think that there is a better investment you can make like don't try and buy some fifty thousand dollar house in Ohio, to try and get $500 a month, passive, cash flow.
18:59
When you can take 50 Grand, invest into high level groups.
And I guarantee you you will make more than $500 a month.
So anyways, I hope this of this makes sense for you.
I hope this was bad.
Before you those two experiences were the biggest life-changing experiences for me and so you know, hopefully one person Listen to this and says you know, I'm going to pull the trigger on something that I wasn't otherwise going to even though it's a stretch because at the end of the day, if I execute everything in this group, then I'll get with these guys have.
19:25
So keeping awesome.
Happy Sunday, got some cool stuff coming and put you guys soon.

Welcome to the Jim Secrets, podcast this episode originally aired in December of 2018, you have to teach people how you like to be treated.
0:38
Now, welcome to the game, where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Good morning, happy Saturday.
I'm really excited for this podcast video because I've actually had this concept on my mind.
1:00
This this this piece probably for the last two and a half weeks, I feel like it's been like in the back of my mind like percolating and whatnot, and it's combining with like four or five other ones that I like felt it this morning.
As I was eating breakfast, I was like all right today's the day I'm gonna make it so originally I wanted to call this, why?
1:17
I don't go home for the holidays and there's probably going to be some things that I say that are a little bit controversial, but there are things that have absolutely been some of the keys to our continued growth and success.
Yes.
And I thought you might want to hear them.
1:33
And so I put the title of this for, at least for right now, as success equals m grain intolerance and so, one of the reasons that I don't go home for the holidays, is that a lot of people haven't haven't grown?
Since I left, right?
They haven't had 10 years of growth, they've lived the same six months, 20 times, right?
1:53
Since I was gone and when I go back they want to meet me in my past and so they Want to speak things over me that aren't Who I Am anymore, and then because it's difficult for them to to the word connect, right?
2:11
The their perception of who I used to be and who the person is sitting in front of them, how they reconcile.
Thank you reconciling.
Those two things is really difficult for a lot of people because it's breaking the Box.
They want to put you in.
But the reality is that most people don't change.
2:30
Entrepreneurs do because we have to write, we call it growth instead of change.
But for the outside world, for the non entrepreneurs, who stay in their sandbox every day, it's, it's hard to calculate.
And so I'll go home and they'll say, oh, like my dad says that.
2:46
So say you have a, you have the shortest fuse out of anyone.
You just have such a short temper.
And anyone who is in our company, my wife, like, I mean, anyone who knows me and spend time with me, would probably not.
Say that.
And and so, I will be, I mean, very aggressive in combating that immediately because I'll be like, don't speak that over me, that's not true.
3:09
That's not who I am.
And it makes people really uncomfortable and so there's a lot of times if I go see an uncle, you know what I mean?
If I'm at a holiday event and then they're like, oh Alexander, you've always been a little bit loose with the alcohol but I don't even drink anymore.
3:25
You know what I mean?
Like, you're speaking about my past and it makes people Really uncomfortable and I would implore you to meet those things head-on.
And the reason that I don't like going home for the holidays because I have to be on guard because when I when I leave I feel like I have to like wash myself of the things that people were trying to speak over me and it's constant.
3:49
It's undone.
It's unending, its incessant, right?
They're constantly trying to put me back in the box.
That makes sense to the right and I Use to have that happen.
And so, when I have these conversations, it's passing comments.
4:04
It's little things.
It's never because most people aren't confrontational, right?
And so it's never like, you are like, you don't know me.
Like, it's not like that, but it's just like, oh, you know, how you always are.
And they'll say, even with like a smile, like, it's like, it's a good thing.
But like you have to catch it because you know how it makes you feel when you hear it.
4:23
You're like, that's not true.
That's not me, right?
I'm done with that.
That's in my past, right?
And so like this is who I am and I have to take like a week to detangle and then basically re speak over the things that I am or that I choose to be right?
4:39
And so it's one of the main reasons that I don't go back for the holidays and I really, really don't like it.
And I definitely don't like spending any portion of extended time there is because it feels like I'm going backwards.
And and what, you know what we are.
All as a community trying to accomplish is not normal and we just have to come to terms of the fact that It isn't normal, it's okay that it's not normal, but it also means that normal people aren't going to like it, right?
5:05
And so like the the higher up we go in business.
I think, at least this is just my subjective understanding or how I'm how I'm perceiving it.
As I go through it, the more intolerant we become of people who try and I mean, it's even tones.
5:21
Like, I'll be like, don't speak to me in that tone.
Even if they're saying, they're I think I'm like, it seems disrespectful.
It bothers me.
And, like, you become more and more aware.
Because you're like let me teach you how to treat me, right?
And sometimes you have to do that and especially when it's been a long period of time.
5:37
You have to teach people how you like to be treated now and a lot of times it's a lot different than it was when they first met you, right?
And it's the hardest with family because I'll be really real with you.
There's a lot of people that I'm connected with that.
I probably would never see again.
If I didn't have a blood relation and I manage our space very well and so if we you know we go back it's only going to be Or a short period time because there's no other reason besides the fact that we share a biological bond that I would ever see you because you haven't, you don't have the same goals.
6:06
You don't have the same values.
You don't want to do the things I want to do.
When we see each other, you make me feel worse.
Why would I see, right?
Just being very real with you guys and maybe this is something that I look back at this video, five years from now, and I'll have grown more, and I'll have more perspective, but that's, that's where we are now.
6:24
Now, total total pivot.
Like sometimes you know what, I'm not going to Pivot like I'm going to.
I'm going to dive a little deeper in this.
Hopefully he's you guys don't mind like being so intolerant of this stuff is like is so key to being able to like grow I'm telling you because and that's why, that's why.
6:44
There's no we keep such quiet space, right?
Because it's like, the only place you don't have to have your guard up constantly fending off.
What other people are trying to tell you about yourself, right?
And so, you can kind of build it while it's while it's in its infancy, and you're not as strong yet.
6:59
Yet in these new attributes that you're trying to have, I was talking to a high level entrepreneur yesterday, right?
And he's like, ah, I mean I'm just horrible to details and I was like, don't speak that of yourself.
I'll stay because your business might need you to be good at details when you go from 10 to 20 million, right?
7:17
Don't say that.
And he was like, you're right.
I was like, yeah, you choose your choosing cannot be good at details, right?
You really think that if your kids were going to die, like you need to look learn to remember things to be able to do it.
Well, yeah, I'm like, all right, When you're choosing not be good at it, that's your choice that you believe, right?
7:33
And so like if you identify these things like man I'm getting really deep on this, I know.
But like the identity is so fluid like we can change in an instant like Tony Robbins talks about this stuff all the time.
Like like we can just like the only the only moment that we're actually will live in is right now, right?
7:51
And so, all of the things that we had before us are only stories that we can either choose to replay because they're positive attributes or choose to ignore.
Nor if they're negative attributes in a lot of us just stay in these Loops of speaking.
These things over ourselves that don't even serve us, right?
8:06
One of my favorite things in the world, probably one of my favorite scent.
Like one of the most profound sayings is we questioned all of our beliefs except for those that we truly believe and those we never questioned it all and I always I love that because it just makes you aware of.
8:22
Like I love catching myself on a belief that I've always had that I believe so thoroughly Me that I never actually thought to question it because that's how much I believed it, right?
It's just been there and so like the higher up we go the more we kind of uncover these beliefs about what's possible.
8:41
What can we do?
How can we grow?
How quickly can change happen, right?
I mean if you look at our business hopefully you guys enjoy Saturday morning with me, if you look at our business, right?
Like we pivoted from a done-for-you model to the done with you model that we have now in April of, 17.
9:02
Right?
And so, from April of 2017 until today, right?
That's like 19 months, I think, right?
We've gone from zero, to arguably the biggest company Fitness, like in the brick, and mortar gym fitness world and we're like two or three times the size of anyone else who's like the second, runner-up and 2019.
9:22
We're going to probably three to four x that I can say that pretty with a lot of certainty.
And so like how quickly are you able to achieve what?
You want to achieve?
Is it supposed to take a year because you're choosing to believe that it's supposed to take a year?
Right, how quickly can you onboard?
9:38
Someone, let me give you another story.
I was.
So we're about to do a very big launch for our Legacy group.
I can't tell you what it is, but a friend of mine launched a new service category in his business and it blew up overnight.
He had a huge explosion of traffic.
9:56
He was running like some ads and they just took off, right?
You couldn't do anything about it and so he hired Thirty people in 14 days, first customer service team, People in 14 days, right?
And so, when we had our queue for planning, right?
10:11
Our core, our fourth quarter planning, we had our customer service director and I Lily, I love you to death has nothing to do.
But like this was what happened during that during the actual meeting, she was like I feel comfortable saying that I can bring four people on every month between now and next launch day.
Right?
Which would, you know, get us to probably 16 or so people 16 to 20 right by the launch date which is going to be like 3 or 4 months away real quick.
10:35
Guys, if you can think of, About how you found this podcast?
Somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this podcast that you do the exact same thing.
10:54
So if it was a review if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
And so then I told that story about my friend who had just done this, he hired Thirty people in 14 days because he had to write.
11:10
And so a lot of times, the necessity is one of the biggest things that allows us to break our beliefs because we have to we have no other choice, right?
And so, I love thinking and that's why when we have scripts and whatnot and the the show rates, double based on the fact that, you know, you actually are going to leave a location and you're not going to be able to sell that person.
11:27
The tonality of how you're speaking of the prospect even though the words are the same.
The fact that it's just what you believe, that changes the outcome of the influence on the other person is like so cool to me.
And so the question is like, how can we trick ourselves right into believing, what we need to believe in order to grow faster, right?
11:48
I made this, I did this experiment, you know, three years ago where I put on like 35 pounds of muscle and six weeks, right?
And I started and they asked me to write an article as muscle strength and I did it natural.
You can choose to believe you or not, but I did and It was it was there by pounds of muscle but it was 35 pounds and they're a lot of it was module within six weeks.
12:09
And I started the article off by saying like, what if you actually had to gain 35 pounds in six weeks and get and add 100 pounds to your Bachelor, would you do, right?
And so I try to put this can like these confines on myself and I was like, I probably wouldn't just lift, you know, twice a week.
12:25
I ride for that lift.
I probably lift it like once or twice a day and then that's what I did.
And then I got really, really strong really fast.
I 100 pounds in my pitches six weeks and I always natural, right?
And I did that because of the confinement like the confines that we put ourselves in there and so sometimes I wonder like what things are, we allowing to be spoken over ourselves by others first and then second what?
12:49
Things are we speaking of ourselves?
That we don't even know that we're doing and so constantly questioning like those things that we speak over ourselves as been honestly, one of the biggest things that has allowed us to grow.
And so, I know that I haven't been as taxable in the last few content videos.
13:07
I hope you guys don't mind, it's just been what's on my mind, we had Chris and Robin Barnett, who flew out here because they want a competition that we were holding in secret.
And anyway, so Christian, Robin bar and came out and they were like, we feel like we're stuck, right?
13:22
We feel like we're in a bottleneck and like, we just can't, you're just trying to break through.
And when I talk to them about it, I the whole time they were You're for the whole day.
I didn't tell him a single tactical thing to do differently with their business, not one, but we identified was the things that they were speaking over themselves in the things that they were choosing to believe about how quickly things can happen, right?
13:46
And so, I'll give you an example.
I hope they don't mind.
Robin is Chris's wife didn't want to be in the gym anymore.
She's like, it's not my passion, you know, like I like now we're comfortable.
Like, I kind of want to do my own thing and so it was causing some Strife in their relationship mostly because like, you know, No.
14:04
She felt, you know, but truth to him, that he had to keep doing it for the he felt guilty that she normally there's just kind of both sides of it, right.
And so they were like, what we're going to let Robin go.
You know, she's gonna leave inform us rights are getting it for months and then she'll get out of the business and I was like why didn't she just get out today?
14:21
Like she doesn't want to do it.
You don't want her there, like why don't you just get out today?
Like why are you choosing to believe that it needs to take four months?
No, I guess it doesn't.
It was like, right?
And so a lot of times like I've just this is just been recently for me.
I've had a lot of conversations with guys who are doing 5 to 12 million a year in their businesses and a lot of them have been doing this a lot longer than me and they're like, oh, you freaking grown.
14:49
So if like, how are you hitting the numbers you're hitting, how is the growth rate that you guys are having like, how is it possible, right?
And like, we've really just like, that's right, not to be weird about this, but like, we've Chosen to believe it's possible, Right?
We've really just chosen to believe it's possible and a lot of times like if you talk to them and like you look at, it's like you see these guys for a really really, really high up in the business World.
15:12
A lot of times I do talk very non-taxable very much mindset stuff and I think it's and I used to really not appreciate it, but now I think I'm appreciating a little bit more because the reason that a lot of people aren't successful is because of the belief that they have, because if you can remove and break those beliefs, a lot of times, they will go find the Tactics that are necessary right to win.
15:32
And so and the higher up, you go the the cleaner people keep their space and the reason they do that, the reason they keep it.
So quiet is so that they can pinpoint anything that comes in their area, right?
Anything that's going to break or chip it them or just like bother them in any way.
15:50
The keep this bubble around them.
And then what that does though is that it gives them such clean perspective, including Vision on, what's going on.
Because a lot of times when I have Sighs.
Like I said, well to don't, you know, five six, ten million a year and they're like, what's going on?
It becomes really obvious.
16:06
It's really, it's really apparent.
I'll give you another example.
I had yesterday, I talked to a guy who's doing, he's doing half a million a month right now, and he has a split between two businesses.
He's got one business does like four hundred thousand a month.
He's got one that does 100,000 a month and he's like well the big you know the form of thousand dollar month, business is my old business, it's the one that it's got all the complexity and Hate.
16:29
Customers all this stuff, right?
And then he's like and then this business is really simple.
It's super profitable.
I'm running like three times the margin.
I run in that business and and he's like so I just I said I just can't figure out how to grow.
And also do you really can't figure out a girl?
16:48
He's like, yeah, just I got so much stuff going on and I was like, yeah, you should probably just get rid of the thing.
That is a big headache for you and do the thing that you really like doing.
I was like, do you think if you got rid of all of the attention that that for That was our main thing is sucking up.
You be able to double the hundred thousand and one things like yeah, like easy and I was like cool.
17:06
Then why don't you do that, right?
And it becomes really apparent in obvious to you on the outside.
Like I mean these guys aren't dumb, you know?
I mean he's doing 698 like he's not stupid, it's just the beliefs that we truly believe are the ones that we don't see.
Right?
And so it's really interesting and like I think all the time about like I want to be wiser, I want to have more discernment and if you really if you start to dissect, Act like what is wisdom, right?
17:31
Wisdom is being able to see is that it's two people are looking at the same situation.
The wiser person sees things that the other person doesn't and so it's Vision.
It's being able to see what other people's don't see.
And a lot of times they're just unseen chains.
17:47
That people have already chosen the tie themselves up with right?
And we're having a lot of German words.
I've had just recently a string of gym owners who you're talking like man, we're just stuck at sixty thousand a month.
Like, I don't know what this bottleneck is.
And I always respond like it's not the business model, right?
It's you.
18:03
And it's and it's and I should probably respond more specifically.
It's a belief that you have that you haven't identified them, that's holding you back.
A lot of times it's just because you're choosing to make less money like no joke, a lot of people choose to make less money so people like off we have Jim wanted right now who are ask like, hey like I've got this campaign it's crushing it.
18:26
I think I'm going to turn it off for next month, right?
Because like we have a lot going on and I'm like if you want to choose to make less money, that's your choice, you know?
And so, we make these choices.
Like, if you, if you order, articulate them differently, you probably think they were ridiculous and I had every confidence.
18:41
Conversation, I've had just in the last two weeks, I've talked to for entrepreneurs, last two weeks that are doing 5 million or more per year.
And each one of the conversations ended with like, well, when you put it like that, I sound like an idiot.
Now, it's like well are you?
It's like well known.
I was like, then you should probably change the way you're doing it, right?
18:59
And so it's just these emotions in these beliefs that get in our way of like, what is seems so obvious.
And it's just because some, we are emotional beings, right?
We are, we make decisions with emotions and we try and logic it later, but when you look at things lat, Typically, a lot of times, some of the, some of the, the answers are obvious, right.
19:16
Well, I've got this trainer that I've had for two years, but they're such a pain.
They never want to do anything other than anything that's new, but I have some clients that that's the like, mm.
Okay.
Do you think that if you had a new trainer that was like bought in that you would be able to grow more.
So, red it is, is the fear of losing these few clients that are attached to this one trainer is outweighing the potential growth.
19:38
You would have from the key player that you know you need in order to make the model work, right?
And then when it's phrase that way, it becomes obvious.
Yeah.
I got to let him go duh but you don't have the perspective it and so sometimes you just need someone on the outside.
But anyways guys, thank you for spending Saturday morning with me.
19:55
This was Just something that was on my mind.
And I just like, it was like, stirring me, but be mindful of the things that's people speak over you and the tone that they do it and just like if you feel weird after someone says something stopped the conversation, catch it, and then address it and be.
20:11
Like, please don't speak to me like that.
Please don't say those things about me.
It really bothers me.
I'm really working on this, where I've worked a lot on this and I don't, I don't appreciate it.
It really bothers me, and if that person cares about you, they will change.
And if they do Don't get him out of your life.
20:26
You don't need that, right?
And and the most important person to make sure that you're doing that with his you like if you were the one who saying man, I'm just not good at details man.
I'm just I'm just I hate employees.
Good Luck running a business.
Like I hear something like these are things I over here even in our group like employees are idiots.
20:46
And like do you really think that that is a good belief to grow and repeat inside of yourself if you want to grow and scale a business?
Probably not, right?
Like be mindful of the things that you're saying because and then ask yourself like does this belief certain and if it doesn't get rid of it.
21:04
So anyways I hope you guys have an amazing weekend.
Love you all.
Thank you guys for for for giving me your attention.
I know it's your most valuable resource, so thank you.
I hope I gave you a good return on it and I hope you guys have an amazing, amazing day.
All right to love








0:00
Real quick.
Cause you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
The nice thing is that there's thoughts are on Roan.
And the circumstances do not create those, we create those thoughts about the circumstances, welcome to the game, where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer, and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:41
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Hey, which one everyone?
Happy Monday.
Happy labor day.
I want to make this podcast for you partially because I'm making it for myself.
So I'm really trying to document the process and the third thought Journey that I'm currently going through.
0:56
So, you know, a few podcasts ago I talked about.
How we've been stuck at roughly 30 million for the last three years and that's 100% my fault because I'm not developing as an entrepreneur, or there's a, there's an obstacle or a bottleneck that I'm not aware of.
1:13
And so, over the last 45 days, I was just at a very high level Mastermind.
There were eight people there that the total yearly revenue of the eight.
People, they're combined to 500 and over 500 million dollars a year just from eight people.
1:29
And so it was a cool opportunity for me to be the second smallest business there.
And you know, there's tons of tactical takeaways and recruiting talent and structure and, you know, structuring for growth and all that kind of stuff.
But I think the biggest takeaway I had was actually from Brooke Castillo, so she's a world-renowned life coach and it became apparent and, you know, talking with these entrepreneurs, the many of us, you know, get stressed at times time.
1:57
So if you ever been stressed, then this is 100%.
For you.
And so she presented her model.
So there's 100% her models.
Not mine of how she walks people through changing their lives, right?
And so the model works like this, there's five components to it.
2:14
It starts with your circumstances, right?
Circumstances are facts, that no one can argue, right?
Like, what will be presented in court?
Susie yelled at Dave is not something that you could present in court.
You could say, Susie said, these exact words, right?
And then, Dave believe she is he out that his, you know, Stacy's yelling at him, whereas Stacy think she was just talking, right?
2:35
And so, that's where circumstances have to be objective in facts circumstances that we experience like a car accident, like somebody dying, right?
Create thoughts, right?
And we have thoughts about those circumstances.
The nice thing is that their thoughts are our own and the circumstances do not create those.
2:53
We create those thoughts about the circumstances from those thoughts.
We have feelings, right?
We have a motion.
Is that are attached because we give meaning to those circumstances.
And then from those from those meanings and emotions that we feel, we take action and from our actions, we have results, right?
3:10
But the part that's most important is you can probably see is the thoughts that we have about the circumstances and so it's peeling those two layers apart and so when she got up and she basically was like there's no reason that you guys should be stressed, business is not stressful.
Your thoughts about business are what are creating stress in our lives, right?
3:31
And that was, that was for me, very, because I've been, you know, I get stressed all the time, like, many people do, but seeing that separation for me, was really powerful.
And so I'll give you a real.
She does this in all she does in marriage and substance abuse.
She does it for she's total.
3:47
I mean it doesn't you can apply to anything, right?
But one of one of the guys who's there was saying he was struggling with an aspect of His marriage, right?
And there's something you know there's wife wasn't doing that he wanted her to do or whatever it was right and one of the other guys pepped up and was like, that's so interesting because and that guy, the first guy when his wife wasn't doing that he would feel rejected or unloved or whatever, right?
4:14
But the second guy, pepped up and had the exact same circumstance, but he'd interpreted it as something that was positive in his marriage is something that actually made his wife.
Loved him more not less.
And so, both entrepreneurs were presented with the exact same circumstance, but both had different thoughts about it, and a result of those differences and thoughts.
4:35
They had different feelings as a result of that about their marriage, about themselves, Etc.
And so, this was really profound for me.
And so this is probably what I was chewing on the majority of the weekend, you know, while the sessions went in and out.
And so the next morning or two mornings after she had presented that model, I was walking with Layla and we were talking about about onboarding, right?
4:57
For our software company, we wanted to get people activated faster.
I really, I need to get them activated.
I need guys to start taking action better at cetera and so we're really trying to rehaul this whole activation process and I noticed myself, get stressed, I could feel the stress.
I was like I'm getting, you know, I can feel my chest is like I'm getting stressed right now and so we had been walking and I said, you know what?
5:17
I'm just going to go back to the house and you keep walking.
I feel like I'm not being good company right now.
So I went back to the house and lucky for me.
I was actually bunking Being not bunking but you know, we're, I was in the same house as Brooke was, so we were into two houses for everybody.
And we're was there drinking coffee.
5:33
And she was like, hey, let's, you know, what's up?
And so being the person I was, I was like, hey, I'm trying.
Let me like teach me how to walk this model with you right now.
All right, I'm feeling the stress, right?
So the circumstance is that Layla?
And I discussed onboarding, right?
5:50
And that it wasn't as good as it needed to be.
The thoughts that I have a result of that we're that I don't know how to do this.
What if I can figure it out?
What if this means that I'm going to fail and then and and I basically had to pull that thread and keep pulling right and for me, as I continue to pull that thread for me it was I think that my dad's not going to love anymore.
6:14
I don't think he's gonna respect me anymore.
And so like for me that's like my central core thing, right?
That's something that I've struggled with, it's my own demon, right?
But in kind of saying it out loud.
I feel like I released a little bit of it.
And so after saying that and be like, okay she's like, well you're going to have to deal with that.
6:32
And so I called my dad up, actually this morning and I was like, Hey, I just need to tell you that.
My my biggest fear is that you don't love me if I fail, right?
Like if I lose everything because my dad's really proud of me and he's, you know, he voices that over and over again, but the fear that I have is that I would have the potential lose that, right?
6:52
If I make a mistake or make the wrong call, I make the wrong bet that I'm going to lose that and so it's a fear of potential loss.
And so in talking to me about, he's like there's nothing you could do.
That would make me, not love you or not respect you etcetera.
But what was interesting is that after he said that, and he got emotional because he was like, I don't want you to ever think I wouldn't love you and respect you and blah, blah blah.
7:13
And the thing is with, I believe him or not.
The point is that for me I didn't feel any relief after hearing that, I didn't feel any better.
And so, it made me keep thinking keep walking, keep thinking to myself and I think what it came down to for me.
7:29
And the reason I'm making this podcast is one because I want to document this Batu, if there's anybody else's, you know, thinking through these thoughts.
Then hopefully, this will be of value to you.
But what I basically just came to is that my real fear is that I lose respect for myself and that I stopped loving myself, right?
7:46
And I think that I have loved and respected myself, conditionally, not unconditionally, and so, When people ask me, you know, how are you so motivated, how do you keep pushing, how do you keep pushing?
I think the deep dark piece of that is that I'm just afraid of losing respect for myself of thinking that I am worthless.
8:04
If thinking that I'm useless and thinking that I'm no good of that, I'll never be good enough, right?
Hey guys, love that.

So check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, And so, for me, I'm not saying I've solved this equation by any, by any stretch of the imagination, but by walking through that thought model and now, I'm actively just trying to stay tuned to when I feel something.
8:45
What is the thought that generated the feeling?
And he's that thought reasonable from the circumstance, or the facts that have been created is their alternative thought that I could replace In that model to create a different feeling which would then create a different action, right?
And then ultimately a different result of my life.
9:01
And so for me, my goal right now is I think the reason that that I've been Limited at 30, there's plenty of reasons probably but one of the reasons that we've been limited mid-30s is that I have not confronted this because I run this business off of fear.
9:17
I'm afraid of failure, rather than the being able to be clear minded and go 100% all-in.
End and kind of do away with the fear and pursue the goal with Reckless abandon, which I think is, what's necessary to get to the next level.
9:35
And so for me, that's something that I'll be working on and thinking about thinking about my own thoughts.
And one of the interesting things about this is that when you step out of yourself for a moment, when you feel the stress, or when you feel the rejection, and when you feel the anger, we feel the sadness, or you feel whatever it is, you're feeling, whether it's something with your wife, or with your Yes, or an employee or or whatever.
9:57
Right?
When you step out of it for a second, the emotion loses a little bit of control over you because you get to observe it as a third party and think is this thought serving way?
Right?
Is the thought that created this emotion serving me, is it true?
Right?
And for me, and asking my dad flat out if I lost everything, would you still respect me?
10:16
You said of, obviously, he said, I respect your effort, not your outcome, but I don't think that I've respected my effort, I've only respected my outcomes.
And so what's interesting is that, when I think about this, within the context of our business and our clients, I respect the hell out of people that I see who hustle every day, but I actually don't apply that to myself, right?
10:38
I didn't respect myself.
I did not love myself, not trying to be soft with you.
I'm just being real with you while I was going through it.
I was not happy.
I was not satisfied, right?
And it was just an intense amount of pain.
That drove me out of that period of my life.
10:57
And so, When I was talking with Brooke, she was like you know, fear and pain is, what got you to 30 million a year?
You're not going to pain your way to a hundred million, but you're not going to pain your way there.
You have to figure out how to get out of that so that you can make decisions without fear.
11:18
And so that is the chapter I'm currently in, on a personal level because I truly believe that businesses are only limited by the entrepreneur, they're only limited by the owners, and I think I've been a limiter for my business and so maybe some of this may apply for you, maybe it may not.
11:36
But I wanted to at least document part of this journey for myself, on the way.
So anyways, hope you guys have an amazing Labor Day coming up with some cool checklists.
It's for our site to improve that onboarding process.
I was talking about that was that was giving me anxiety, and I hope you guys have an awesome day and keep crushing it and accomplishing your goals.
11:58
And most importantly, respecting yourself for the effort that you put forth rather than the outcome.
And the nice thing about that is the only person who can judge you on your effort, is you.
So anyways, lots of everybody, hope you crush it and I'll catch you soon.
Bye.

Real quick guys.
If you can think about how you found this podcast, somebody probably tweeted it told you about it.
Should it on Instagram or something like that?
The only way this grows is through word of mouth and so I don't run ads, I don't do sponsorships, I don't sell anything.
I only ask is that you continue to pay it forward to whoever showed you or however you found out about this Pockets that you do the exact same thing.
0:19
So if it was a review, if it was a post, if you do that would mean the world to me and you throw some good karma out there for another entrepreneur.
If you don't have a regimented process around learning and of course, In skills.
Then I can guarantee that you're not going to get as far or as fast as you'd like to be welcome to the game, where we talked about it, get more customers how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
0:42
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on, everyone?
Happy Tuesday.
I wanted to counter my podcast yesterday with something.
Hyper tactical that can immediately provide value to you.
And so what I wanted to kind of go over is a crash course on learning shit.
1:00
Last.
So I think it's no mystery to many of us have seen the entrepreneurial space that in order to move ahead.
We need to acquire skills, right?
And so, creating a process of our own skill acquisition.
I think, is one of the most deliberate ways that you can force growth, right?
1:17
If there's two people who are the same age and one person is far ahead of the other then it's simply because that person is required more skills than the other, right?
And so, If you don't have a regimented process around learning and acquiring skills, then I can guarantee that you're not going to get as far or as fast as you'd like to be with interesting.
1:36
Is that a lot of things you need to learn?
Go from skills to character traits to beliefs and so some of those require deep work or just settle what I was sharing about yesterday.
But many of you are not right there.
So I'm gonna go see some of the basics and I don't see basic sit with you, no tongue and cheek.
1:54
Most of being an expert is, never not doing the basics, so many times people.
I remember when I was earlier on in my career, I had watched guys get on stage and talk about what they were doing and I was like, there's just, there's no way it's that easy.
And as I was saying it, I was not even doing the stuff that they were that they were saying to do, right?
2:12
I was like, no way.
It's not just, you know, simple ads and retargeting it's like I was even running at its right.
And so, anyways over time I've kind of developed a process for learning skills quickly and this You know, applying this enabled me to get 99th percentile on the GMAT really having no, you know, testing experience going into it, which is above Harvard Smith score and so this really works.
2:36
All right?
This is like about as hyper tax bills and yet and one of these text I got from Russell Brunson at The Mastermind that I was just at right and he said it offhandedly and I was like, dad is really good.
All right, so the first one I'll give you is his and then I'll give you what I've done.
2:51
All right, so what he explained to me is that He's always told me that he always likes audibles, he likes listening to books.
Like that's how he learns Etc.
But when we were at the event, he talked to me about how he actually does both, so, he reads and listens to the book.
3:07
Now, some of us have done both right?
We've read a book and we're like, I'm going to the auditory list inaudible.
Need to read the book but it turns out you can actually do both at the same time.
And so what that means is you put on your headphones, right?
You turn on your audio.
But what's nice about this is that Amazon, especially they sync up.
3:22
So if you listen for further, if you've never Two things on Amazon.
I'd recommend it but you can listen to an audiobook.
And then we're you pause.
You can open up your Kindle and it will take you to the part in the book that you left off.
Now, the reason I think is so powerful is a couple reasons.
One is I'm super 80 day, right?
3:39
So like I'll be reading and I think I can read fairly quickly but I I get I get pulled off track really quickly to so like I might power through like four pages and do it in you know a few minutes and then all of a sudden five minutes goes by because I think about something that is on the page and then I'm like wait where was Try again and then have to kind of start over.
3:56
And so there's kind of the start and stop and so for me that's actually the biggest things that takes away from my reading speed.
So what you can do and this is what I got from him is listen to the audible at 3 x 3 and a half X speed.
So it's about as fast as it goes.
Now if you're just listening it feels kind of weird but if you're reading and listening you pretty much read much faster than you talk out loud or most people read faster.
4:17
They talk out loud but when you hear the words as you're reading them, you get both the hearing memory.
Yeah, and your visual memory and so they kind of pair up.
So you're actually storing the information to places so it's just like an absolute learning hack but fun but realistically the reason that I found it so beneficial is it actually just kept me on track and so I you know, very regularly I want to I want to stop reading but the thing is to still dragging me on and it keeps my piece for me because I don't want to lose track with the audible, right?
4:50
Hey guys real quick for those of you guys who are 100 million-dollar offers fans I love you.
I added in a lost chapter that has never been released.
I'm releasing it now transparently.
I'm doing that to build hype 400 dollar leads but you will have the unreleased chapter, it talks about your first Avatar and how to segment customers to make more money.
5:08
You can get it by going to acquisition.com forward slash leads.
Its fo free in exchange for your email so that I can email you when we launched under Miller leads and so that you can not miss out on it.
Because last time I sold out for like Eight straight weeks really fast.
So, that is my way of making sure that y'all get first dibs.
5:26
And so, by doing this, I think it just it also gives me an exact amount of time that I know that each book will take.
So for me, I like to have it Quantified.
I'm like, okay, if I'm going to take on this book, you know, this is the one that Russell recommends American Kingpin.
It's a cool story but it's a kind of a thick book like this is a serious book.
5:44
And what by doing this, I knew that this book was going to take me exactly 3 hours and 15 minutes to read, right?
Because the audible based on the speed, was going to take that long, right?
And so then it allows me to be like cool.
I'll do Our 45 today to hopefully find some more time knock this out.
All right, so just really, really cool.
6:01
And I've been using it and it's been awesome.
So I already read a book and a half since the event which I never, I really don't read that many books in general, which leads me to my next point.
I mean, huge, huge, proponent of not reading lots of books but reading a few books many times, right?
6:18
And so I can't tell you the amount of times that I go too often or events, or we speak at something, and someone comes up, and I'm like, oh well you have you read this have Your this and they're like, oh yeah, I've read all those books and like, well, yeah, you're not doing, it will tell me about this and then they can barely even talk about the book is about, right?
They've no, they have no comprehension, right?
6:35
They have, no, it doesn't stick, right and so it's there's no notch on the belt.
For how many books you read.
It's about how much stuff you retain and how much you can ultimately, apply, right?
Of course.
So my to kind of rules around.
This is if in this first section of a book, I don't feel like I've gotten value.
6:54
I stopped reading the book and it's because, I used to have this thing where it's like if I start a book I can't read any other book until I finish it but the route is that there's some books that just aren't worth reading, you know?
I mean, if you read a Blog article and you're like this is just not interesting.
You just skip off, right?
And books are really no different there just written by office, right?
They just might not be good.
7:10
It's possible people publish stuff all the time.
That's not good, right?
It's a giving yourself permission to stop reading a book and then on the converse of that if you read a book and you're like man this is so good.
Read it and then turn it back over to the beginning and read it again.
7:26
And turn it back over to the beginning and read it again.
Like the second edition of expert Secrets, I think I've read eight or nine times, right?
The second edition of Doc.
I'm Secrets.
Now, mind you, I've already read the first edition five times, right?
But reading the second edition was entirely nude.
7:43
By the way, if you didn't know that, it's totally new book which I highly recommend you getting go to Russell's book.com, I'll put the link in the thing but it's our usse LS.
Book.com anyways you can You can get this up there, but by doing this my goal is that if I that if the book disappears tomorrow that I will know everything that's in that book, right?
8:06
Because if you don't know what's in the book, there's no point in you reading another book that may or not be good may or may not be good when you have a beautiful amazing book in front of you.
So when you do find one of those gems, right?
And for some of you, if you're in the gym business, you're more secrets.
I highly recommend.
Reading it, it's ridiculously tactical will make you money.
8:24
You can go to Alex's book.com.
There's my Shameless plug but point is, is that reading it over and over again with the objective of mastering the information so much though, that if there's a framework or there is a model or there's a math, or there's a script that's inside of the book, if you cannot bring it out on command, if you don't, if you don't know the information, if you can't explain it to someone else and you just say, I just got to read the book, then you don't know it and there's no point to reading another book, right?
8:55
And what's interesting to me is That so many people in the religious community will read the Bible over and over and over and over again, right?
Because they find it to be the source of knowledge, right?
It's just this continuous nor knowledge and at different times in your life you pull out different different lessons, right?
9:11
Whereas a really good book, you can do the same thing and so I think that many of us need to read fewer books but find the absolute best books and read them over and over again until you absolutely have mastered them.
And so those are my two greatest learning hacks.
That I've acquired in my life in the latest one was just recently from Russell, which is awesome doing both of those together, it will pull you forward.
9:33
You'll be able to quantify how long it takes, and you better remember it much much better because you store it into places of your memory and then for me to add on to that, just do it over and over again because repetition is the mother of skill and for most of us what we're trying to acquire is skills and that takes repetition in the beginning, its reputation.
9:49
So that you understand the information so that you can apply it without me to constantly reference the book.
Alright.
So anyways hope That has value before.
You, if you're looking to acquire skills, which many people are, then I would recommend doing that and go forth conquer the world.
No, cause you guys look Flipside.
10:05
Bye.








0:00
Hey guys, love that.
You're listening to the podcast.
If you ever want to have the video version of this which usually has more effects, more visuals, more graphs, you know, drawn out stuff.
Sometimes it can help hit the brain centers in different ways.
You can check out my YouTube channel, it's absolutely free.
Go check that out if that's what you are into and if not keep enjoying the show, Most of the time it's because they're just not doing what they're supposed to be doing.
0:24
Welcome to the game where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on everyone?
Having Tuesday?
Hope you guys are having a rocking and rolling.
Start to the week, I wanted to make this podcast, if you're not growing, look for this because there are recurring issues that come up in business.
0:45
And so we had one yesterday.
Jim Holt, it was great.
And just just a fundamental mistake that was being made that hopefully you guys won't have to deal with or suffer from right.
But it's very likely that you some degree are or are not.
And so there's three main points that I think that we hit on in our community then I probably need it on again.
1:07
Which is that many times when you be reminded more than we need to be taught, right?
A lot of times when I look at deficiencies in the business I find that the reason that there are deficiencies is not Something new needs to be done, which is what we as entrepreneurs innately want to do is like oh this isn't working.
1:24
Let's try something new.
When in fact, the reality is that most of the time, they are just not doing the thing that you already said they were supposed to do.
And so, what I have seen time and again, over and over again, at different levels of business, is that the people who are the most, Vince never don't do the basics.
1:40
They always follow up with their leaves.
They always call them in the first five minutes.
They always, you know, respond with an email, they always make sure that people Are on board in the right sequence.
They always always always never down to the basics and so it's the basics that scale simples with scales advances, what breaks.
1:57
And that's why most business owners continue to make these complex things that never actually work and especially don't work at scale if they remove themselves from them.
And so, if there's pieces of your business that consistently break, it's usually because the process is too difficult, A or B.
2:13
It's just not even being done.
And I think that there's this story that we tell ourselves as entrepreneurs, we think about we just You know, I heard about this guy only did, was he changed this one thing and it 3x is business, right?
You just change the button color, you just change the headline, right?
And everything, correct.
But most of the times when you change things, nothing happens, real talk, right?
2:33
Most times when you're like, well, let's switch this word happy to Glad right, I come happy to Glad changes.
And I think that comes from the Contracting world.
I came from as they call them happy to Glass, which is like people just change stuff for the sake of changing it and doesn't actually change anything at all.
And so I think most of the times when we Look at our business.
2:49
We look at something that's not working, we see a happy and then say, you know what, it's not working.
Let's do let's switch to glad but the reality is that they weren't even doing the happy process.
They weren't even doing the thing that you told them to do to begin with.
And so when you examine that like and it's mind-blowing so like very here's a very real example, I just found out that are like our team on the Marketing sales side was not falling over the applications, didn't schedule a call.
3:13
So people who filled out applications and just didn't schedule a time to call because they couldn't figure out.
Out.
They weren't following up with that and I'm like how in what?
Like imagine, right?
You're trying to build this this beautiful acquisition system, this beautiful business, right?
3:29
And the basics aren't even being done Hey Mose, an Asian quick break.
Just to let you know.
We've been starting to post on LinkedIn and want to connect with you.
Alright so send me a connection request.
A note letting me know that you listen to the show and I will accept it.
There's anyone you think that would be should be connected with tag them in one of my or laila's posts?
3:49
And I will give you all the love in the world.
All right, so let's get back to the show.
The basics, right?
And so, I feel like over time I've consistently tried to go back.
And when I look at things that are not performing the way they should, like, I don't even look for advanced stuff.
4:07
I'm like, guys, like we writing headlines that have curiosity, is to creatively, use resonate with the customers were looking for is the offer.
We have something that someone would actually want like like the amount of effort that I go into like that.
I approach problems with now compared to what I did two years ago, three years ago is so much.
4:25
But the lens that I look at is like, guys, what are the woods, the objective, what are the basic steps that need to be done?
And I can't tell you, nine times out of 10, there are Basics that are not being done.
And so, within your business, if you're looking at, bottlenecks are looking at things that are consistently breaking, right?
4:43
Most of the time, it's because they're just not doing what they're supposed to be doing, right?
And so that means that we don't need to make something new.
We don't need to make something fancy.
We simply need to remind the team more than we Teach right?
We don't need to come up with new things, we need to remind them yet again that they have to keep doing the things that got them there.
5:01
And so I think at least for me that's something that I have to consistent, remind myself out because as entrepreneurs, we always like to do new things and what business were usually requires, just do the same things again at the same level and that's what can be and that is why being a can be taxing and challenging.
5:17
But anyways, I hope I hope that a little insight into the the real mess ups that we do all the time.
Obviously they are working.
The applications.
Now, if you did by any chance, apply, they will be reaching out to you.
But just to say, like, it happens at all levels.
5:34
And I think that looking like, if you're not growing, it's probably because something that you think is being done is not being done.
And so, just examining those pieces will usually unearth some gold for you.
And you don't need to create anything, sexier, complex, or Advanced, it's just making sure that they're executing, what, you think they actually are.
5:52
All right.
So anyways, lots of everyone hope you have an amazing Tuesday.
It's always.
We need to be reminded more than we need to be taught.
Experts never known to the basics and that's it.
Hope you have an amazing day.
Catch you guys soon and see you on the flip side back.








0:00
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to 50 $100.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or would like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you can play anywhere on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
0:17
What's up, everyone?
Hope you guys have an amazing, amazing, amazing day today.
This is the gym sneakers pockets of my name is Alex just for the late introduction there.
Today, we're gonna be talking about out something that I'm borrowing from Frank parents and you guys don't afraid current.
0:33
He's an OG internet marketer and a man that I respect a lot in his marketing prowess and one of the things that I want to talk about today is a concept of a big promise.
It's something I was incredibly impactful to me and it's something that I want to talk about today because it's come up in a lot of conversations recently and it's worth exploring side.
0:51
Note, if your gym owner and you want to make more money, just go to, I don't hate money.com only.
If you don't hate money and then apply, and then we'll hop on the phone with you.
We're not going to try and sell you anything.
Well, at least.
Not on the first phone call.
And even if we do, you might like it.
So, give it a shot.
Anyways, I'm actually joking.
We don't take anyone in the first call, but let's talk about the big promise.
1:09
So, the big promise right is is basically, we're probably every one of your prospects and this works in any vertical.
Okay, so if you're in the B2B space, most B2B businesses, say, use my widget Services Etc and you will make more money to get more customers and work less, right?
1:29
I mean, there's There's like marketing agencies who marketed Jim's gurus myself.
I have the same problems and I tell people that we're gonna have to make more money or class and get more apps right?
And make a bigger impact.
So that's what we tell them.
So why is it that this is why I'm not as obsessed about selling now.
1:48
Like if you listen to how I spell expensive stuff, like we go really in depth on sales Theory but like I feel like selling is really just painting, a picture of a dream and as soon as you understand that concept that you're just, you're asking someone where they're trying to go and then painting that picture for them.
2:05
More vividly.
And saying, would you like to go there, right?
And so, but like, I don't think that that's that exceptional, the skill.
I think a lot of people can sell stuff like that.
There's plenty of good salesmen out there.
But there are plenty of kajillion airs out there.
And I think the reason for that is because of the big elephant in the room when it comes to business, is fulfillment.
2:25
How good are you, right?
Do I look like listening to Jim say, ah, do we get amazing results?
People don't really care about results?
I mean, they do But it's going to be the experience and the relationship that's also going to matter.
2:40
Probably factoring just as much if not more than the results and whether or not they're staying, there's almost results they could just, you know, drink slow faster to starve themselves in the lose weight, right?
So it's like what else are we offering?
Right?
And so, when you have exceptional fulfillment in, this is why I'm saying, like the big promise, and I promise, I'll come, I'll come full circle on this even acceptable, fulfillment.
3:00
Then you actually do have this business, that's just a pearl Afraid on its own.
You have to start with Firing friends and you have to keep doing it consistently for a long period of time.
And then what happens is there's this inflection point and then all of a sudden everyone starts telling everyone about it and it's awesome.
But that being said, let's get back to the big promise.
3:18
So if every single service provider in your area says you're going to lose weight, feel better, you'll sleep better and have more energy.
Maybe we'll play with the kids, like you're not unique in that, right?
So how is it that?
This guy gets all his services for 10 times as much as this guy can?
3:34
Right.
Same promise, I mean ultimately even like if you buy a MyFitnessPal app or you know, whatever they're in their apps out there that you can buy their fitness apps, it's the same exact promise.
So, what determines the pricing and what determines the really successful ones, right?
3:50
And it's just, it's just stuck with me.
So, profoundly the extent like these to itch.
A business is successful, is the extent to which a prospect.
Has conviction in the ability of the provider to fulfill that promise.
4:11
I'll say it again, the success of the business is determined are predicated upon the prospects conviction and that businesses ability to fill the promise that was made, right?
4:29
So there's a million agencies that are marketing agents out there.
There's plenty of gurus, who never even known, Jim's you tell people that they're going to help them make more money with the gyms, so why is it that we're growing faster than everyone else?
Right?
Bye.
A lot.
How is that?
It's happening because people believe that when I tell you, they were going to help you make more money with your gym, get you more customers and help you do that.
4:52
Killing yourself.
They believe that I can actually do it.
Now, how do we do that?
Now that's this kind of piggybacks on the whole how to sell expensive stuff but it's two pieces our conviction and I think that at a certain level like either you're a horrible person or your conviction is going to be to a certain extent, an indication of How likely you believe that you can help someone get to a certain destination.
5:16
I 100% believe.
That if we sign you up, we know that you will make more money with us in the next eight weeks.
Then you will pass, usually by 45 x straight up.
I can tell you that right now, so how can I say that with such certainty?
5:35
Because we've done it three hundred times, that's how hey, if you're a return listener and you have not rated or reviewed the show, I want you to know that you should feel absolutely terrible about yourself and everything else in the world.
I'm kidding.
But it would mean the absolute world to me.
5:51
If you guys would go ahead and do that, you don't have to pause the show, you keep listening and you can just do with your thumb right now will take you less than 60 seconds.
And like I said, the only way that podcast arose through word of mouth and this is you joining hands with me and helping as many isomers with possibly can because no one is coming to save us, it's just us.
All right, so please go do that now then let's get back to the show.
6:13
Right?
And so you have to ask yourself if you are in the gym space.
Not only how certain are you that you can get some results, which is not like, which is cool.
But everyone kind of producers everyone has before.
And after pictures on there, that doesn't make you special, right?
6:30
How can you make it as easy as pain-free, right?
As engaging as possible?
So, look at this of human needs, right?
You have status, you have connection, you have no problem.
You have status, you got connection, you got variety of routine, give growth your contribution for the 61's, right?
6:49
So how many of these human needs?
Can we fulfill at our facilities while getting people to stay?
Because we're going to get people to come back if they feel like they're plugged into a community.
If they have friends there, if we've given them more status there than they normally get, if you have somebody who's getting voted member, if I see that you're the MVP of the workout for today, How likely is it that you're going to attend your next workout?
7:13
Pretty hot.
Right?
How many feelgood's do you get after that?
Probably a lot.
Now, if you come to the next workout because of the results you're getting from work out a door copy.
No!
You come in the next workout because you love the rush of dopamine.
You got by getting in group status, that's what you can.
7:30
Right.
And so, how many of these experiences can we engineer?
So that people get these hits of dopamine?
You get these hits of Serotonin where they feel good about themselves.
Feel like they are important, right?
And that they have friends in that Community where they get engaged and plugged in.
7:48
And so, at that point, it becomes a lifestyle because they become locked into the group, the community, the status, the role, the, and then, and then Once you can make it a part of their identity, then you win.
8:04
And at that point, you've made a lifestyle change.
Because over time, we know that if someone keeps working out for three years and eating and making healthier decisions, right?
Meal plan or not macros are not pure decision or not, they're going to probably look pretty good in three years, right?
Because the whole point is that we're selling a lifetime solution except we're not trying to actually get someone hooked for life because we're not doing the rest of the things.
8:27
Anyone can starve someone for 12 weeks and tell him Place.
Duh, but if I can change someone's life, I have to make it part of their identity and that is malaria process.
And so if you start approaching your fulfillment in that way, and then you start getting people hooked in that way.
8:49
And then most, or all of your customers or people who are signing up at your facility are achieving that level of results.
What happens your conviction becomes Rock, Solid, right.
And then you're Prices will reflect that conviction that you have.
9:05
And then as a after math and Factor an after-the-fact, right?
My product, the people that you're trying to sell woman, believe you, because you can look at them with clear eyes and tell them.
I'm going to change your life.
Because you're going to be the type of person that everyone hates because you're going to talk about your gym all the time and you're going to actually be happy to look at healthy recipes and start liking them.
9:31
And you're going to come on the nature hikes with us or play putt-putt with us as a group, when we have our events because you're going to become one of us, right?
And so, when someone's like, I just haven't been able to make it stick.
It's like, because you haven't made it a part of your identity once it's a part of their identity, then you have them for life.
9:50
Then that is how you can charge, whatever you want to charge for that service.
Because what you're doing, is you're giving someone truly in your life because you're changing who they are changing their body or changing their mind, which is far more valuable.
So anyways, hope that was useful for you that kind of hopefully circled back to the big promise which is the extent to which that person believes that, you can fulfill that promise that you're making them because ultimately most prospects that walk into a gym have already heard the same pitch.
10:18
We're gonna help you lose weight, feel better.
Kids all blah blah but it's How likely and what systems you have in place to ensure that I actually get there and then it sticks.
And when you, when you can speak with confidence with the backing with what I just talked about, that's when you can start really making an impact and that's when those people start referring their friends, that's in their friends and family.
10:40
See the change in that person say dang I need to start signing up for what she's doing.
Not hey she's really suffering.
I want to go do that.
Like she's We saw and feels like she's starving all the time is that sustainable?
Probably not, right?
And so we have to change the way we see this.
10:56
So hope that was your for you guys a little bit longer than I intended but hopefully still valuable if you're a gym owner and you are struggling to make ends meet or you want to go to the next level and see how some of the guys that we work with hit a six figures or but six-figure.
11:11
Well, I'm at six figures a hundred two hundred thousand a month in Revenue using the systems that we have to separate them from the marketplace.
It's break the price price product, link our competitive link so they are completely D commoditized.
11:27
They are unique in their space and how we systematically do that.
We would love to show you and happy on the for the songs with you and you can download free case study at the most secret Stockholm for such quiz or go to.
I don't hate money.com have an amazing amazing day and I will talk to you guys on the









0:00
Hey guys, real quick.
So Leyland are definitely working on our social media presence.
If you guys haven't noticed and we're just breaking now into LinkedIn.
All right.
It's not as bad as I thought it's actually a pretty awesome so far and you guys have been really cool in there and people are sharing our stuff a lot.
So if we aren't connected on LinkedIn, it go ahead and let's connect and let's rock and roll.
0:17
Even in a local Marketplace, do you know how many businesses are advertising on Facebook for the same seven mile radius?
Welcome to the game, where we talk about how to get more customers, how to make more per customer, and how to keep them longer and the many failures.
And Essence.
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
0:33
What's going on, everyone?
Happy, Wednesday, excited to make this podcast for you because this is probably one of the more mistakes that I think that I made early on in my career that hopefully I can help avoid or how you avoid in yours and I've written about this and I called the size of the pie fallacy.
0:50
And what the fallacy kind of states is that the size of the pie for most people is not just twice as big or five times as big but probably 100 to 1,000 times as big as you actually think it is and where this comes into, you know, Clarity is that so many of us live in these tiny little pods, right?
1:10
We live in these little ponds, a little buckets of people, right?
We live in, you know, two or three Facebook groups and that's honestly what makes up the majority of our news, right?
We only get news from, you know, a handful of sources and that's what curates our context in the world, right?
1:26
And so we think that if someone new is coming to our marketplace, right?
Right.
All of a sudden, everyone knows about that and everyone's trying to, you know, it's going to leave us to go to this other person.
And this happened for me when I was in my gym, says happened for me.
When we started Jim watched it happen from like it's just happened over to get and I've seen it, you know, on the outside with agencies.
1:46
And I've seen it, literally, at all levels.
And what I can tell you is, when I, when I this probably two years ago, there was an actually I'll tell you first.
One is, when I was at my gyms, I had a new guy, you know, show up on the marketplace.
Like, oh my God, like what are we going to do?
2:02
All these people going to try it there and leave me to go to this other person, whatever.
Right.
But the reality was that most people didn't know I existed.
And most people didn't know they existed, right?
Because most people don't care.
And because the size of the pie is so much bigger than just the two groups of people that I know on Facebook, that exist.
2:18
Right.
And what was even more, is that I looked at all the stuff he was doing.
I remember this like and I was like, okay I'm gonna, I'm gonna model everything that he's doing right to try and beat him and after him out and everything one.
But it didn't convert like ours did.
And then two, I found out later and this is like six months plus later that he was making less than we were.
2:37
And so this whole time I built up, this this fictitious thing in my mind, that was eating an occupying, all of my thoughts and a wasn't doing as well.
And be, it wasn't even making as much, but the thing is that what it did?
Hurt me for is all the time and effort it detracted from me.
2:53
Just focusing on the customers.
I had in front of me who were already there, happy to be working with me and paying me and all that stuff, right?
And so, that was when I had my gyms right later on.
In Jim lat, we had a similar thing happened, right?
You know, new Guru pops up like he's got something hot and sexy, right?
3:08
And then, what do you know, 16 weeks later.
He's gone.
Right?
And the thing is that, like, I've seen the cycle happen enough, and I've been reactive to the cycle, and then be like, oh no, we incorporate something like that are thing about Allah.
But what ends up happening is that you end up shifting directions, really quickly being end up being really reactive, your customers, get confused and ultimately the real real is that the marketplace doesn't even know that either.
3:29
You exist, right?
And so we think about this within the context of Jim's.
Here's a, here's a fun one for you.
I just recently found out that there's a company that I have just barely heard of okay and they sell a software product that kind of just like some sort of Fitness stuff for Jim's.
All right.
3:45
I'm not going to say the name of them and they don't run any ads whatsoever and they have a massive outbound sales team, right?
Cold calling cold email, that's it.
And these guys are doing 10 million a month, okay?
I have never heard of them.
4:03
I never heard right?
I haven't seen their ads.
I've been seeing anybody ever talk about them in any of the groups that I live in and yet they are bigger than we are there three times ourselves, right?
And so, it was just a humbling reminder for me, that again, the size of the pie is so much bigger than we can ever fathom right when we were like, well, there's two of us were competing instead, some, like even in a local market place, do you know how many businesses are advertising on Facebook for the same seven-mile radius, right?
4:31
I go into groups and And, you know, in groups of people who teach local businesses, right and their hair stylist, there's insurance agents.
There's there's Realtors there's chips, there's personal trainers, there's storage facilities.
There's like literally everything, you know, everything, you mattress stores Car Sales.
4:49
There's so many people that are marketing to the same thing that you think that one more gym on Facebook is going to somehow cut cut, you're doing in half, right?
And so anyways, I say all this Say you don't need to worry about that stuff.
5:05
It's it's the size of the pie is so much bigger and what you're looking at is also just like Facebook, right?
There's also, there's Yelp there's Google, there's Google Display Network.
So there's organic, there's email marketing, there's Outreach, there's cold calling.
There's so many ways.
There's direct mail so many ways to acquire customers that we just get stuck in this tiny Viewpoint that that somehow just what we're doing.
5:28
And it's this tiny little slice when in reality us and a hundred other Nurses are just splitting this one slice of Facebook and there's all of these other slices that exist and always do is open up our minds to it and not be reactive to it and simply thing, how can I over deliver my customers, and then how can I add channels over time, right?
5:50
Most Nation real quick.
If you are a business owner that has a big old business and wants to get to a much bigger business, going to fifteen hundred dollars.
Plus, we would love to talk to you and if you like that or like to hear more about it, go to acquisition.com, you planning on the page and talk to one of our team and see if we can help you get there.
6:10
And for me, it was just yet another humbling example of hearing that this guy was doing 10 million a month in my space, I even heard of him.
And so it's just this brilliant beautiful reminder of how small we really are.
And to just continue to focus on the game that we're playing and continue to get better at the game that we're playing and not worry about other people.
6:29
Because at the end of the day, all that matters is the value that you brought in the marketplace values of providing the customers and The Mousetrap that you've devised for monetizing providing value.
So anyways, I hope that serves some Buddy, somebody who's been worried about a competitor or somebody's in the area, and they get this, this fear and anxiety.
6:45
And I feel like I've had it happen enough times.
And I've been disproven so many times that my love of reactivity has continued to go down and down, and down over time to now I just kind of shrug a little bit because I've seen so many people take direct shots at us and then disappear with the nine months.
And so now we just continue to focus on our game.
7:02
Continue to do make them owners money, do it better than everyone else can and run a good business and that's entire goal and I think that if we can translate that, Over then we own the things that we can control and that are accountable for.
So, anyways, lots of everyone hope this makes sense and hope you have amazing pump day.
7:19
Happy winds-day and don't think of anybody else.
Don't worry about anyone else.
Don't worry about your trainers are saying, don't worry about the guy across the street, just remember that?
Basically no one knows you exist, even when you think everyone does, no one does and there's another guy who's 20 times bigger than you, who also that you don't even know exist who's missing marketplaces you.
7:37
So sometimes it's just humbling, reminder that there's a million ways, your car crash.
Murmurs and are tiny little fish.
Bowls that we live in are not the officials that are the world.
So anyways, keeping awesome a gesture, but








0:00
Real quick.
Because you guys already know that, I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me spread the word so we can have more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products, and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
And the only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review will take you 10 seconds or one type of the thumb, mean, the absolute world to me.
0:25
And more importantly, it may change the world of someone else.
What could you do?
I add five million dollars to your bottom line without doing anything, right?
What could you do to add 10 million dollars to the business without adding anything.
Any humans?
Any people, welcome to the game, where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons.
0:46
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
Good morning everyone.
Happy Saturday.
I am super pumped for this podcast because I'm going to talk about what I do on 50,000 Arkansas.
Days that I saw when I have higher level business owners like come in and I'll walk you through the biggest mistake that I've made for a business standpoint.
1:07
I think, I think it's the number one biggest mistake that that I made that, you know, set me back, however, long and how you can learn from it.
So, how many I mean, what is it, two years ago?
Three years ago.
Jim launch was doing 28 million dollars, we'd grown from.
1:24
I think 6.8 228 million in a year so we had, you know, tremendous growth And at that point, I made the mistake of thinking I should start another business which was our supplement business.
1:40
I mean, it still is a good business, it's great, but I think that if I had continued to work on the gym launch business I would have been able to grow to 100 million.
And so what I want to walk you through is kind of some of the mistakes that I made.
But also the two fundamental things that I look at when I do these Consulting days, right?
1:59
And so if you Fifty thousand dollars for the Consulting in a nutshell.
That is what I'm going to cover in this podcast.
And so so buckle up number one whenever I'm trying to do some sort of, you know, high-level Consulting day.
The goal is not to increase complexity of their business, but decrease complexity the business.
2:18
And that also means that whatever the intervention that I'm going to try and provide.
I want it to be as simple as humanly possible in an Ideal World.
We want to ask questions like what could you do to add 5 million dollars?
Bottom line without doing anything, right?
What could you do to add 10 million dollars to the business without adding anything?
2:37
Any humans, any people, right?
And so that's where, you know, one of the first things that we'll talk about is like pricing, right?
So, if we can price appropriately, many times, we could add 23 million dollars to the bottom line to a business without actually changing anything at all.
Right?
And so I say that just as an example of what I would consider a very good intervention.
2:58
That's well worth the 50,000.
Others, you know that someone will pay me, you know, for a day, right?
And so, anyhow the two things that I'll break this down into when I'm looking at someone's business, or I'm trying to improve business, my own, or otherwise is growth, right?
3:14
So there's only two elements of growth, all right, so you've heard me talk about three levers, right?
You can get more customers.
You can get them to spend more.
You get them to stay longer, but if you want to go simpler than that, the way to grow a business is you can either get more customers or make the customers were worth more.
3:30
All right, so I'm going to just use a simple example.
Let's say that you your current signup rate of customers is 10 per month, okay?
And let's say, each of these customers is worth a thousand dollars.
That means that if nothing changes in your business, you will never grow past ten thousand dollars per month, right?
3:51
And so this is how I do the back of a napkin math, to extrapolate, if someone's on a growth projection, where they're going to Plateau, because I For example, if someone selling 10 people a month and the lifetime value is two thousand dollars and they're currently making ten thousand dollars a month, that means if they change, nothing, they're going to continually grow until 20 and then stop.
4:11
So they're on a growth curve, but it will slowly slow down as it approaches 20, it's called an asymptote.
So, basically approaches that Infinity straight line and every month that increase becomes less and less, and they pretty much stabilized around point, right?
And so if we're looking at a business, the first thing out of sight, Side is whether we need to focus more on the back end or we need to focus more on the front, right?
4:35
So I made a podcast earlier called good enough for growth and that's where you're really focusing on the back end, right?
And so there's a huge amount of ways that you can increase the lifetime value, right pricing.
Appropriately is the first and obvious.
One second is adding in, you know, back in continuity, or adding different levels of service for customers that want to upgrade adding in retail.
5:00
Affiliate affiliate deals, basically deals where you can refer portions of business to someone else.
Any of that type of stuff, right?
And get, and get kickbacks from them.
All of these things are things that can increase the lifetime value, decreasing churn, all of those things, increased lifetime value.
5:16
And so I'll look at all of those components of what their numbers are.
Now there are certain benchmarks that I'll look for.
You know, whether it's a let's say it's a brick-and-mortar service, right there certain benchmarks that I look for if it's you.
You know, let's say a chiropractor.
I'd be saying, okay, well, what do you currently making per customer, if they, if I find out that the average person comes in for five bat cracks for 50 bucks.
5:39
Each $250 is really, really bad.
LTV right now.
If you were closer to 2,500 to 4,000 that, I know that because in the reason, this is important is because the cost of acquisition and many times is relatively the same.
So, the cost of acquiring a small business owner in most markets will be between 500 and Fifteen hundred dollars, right?
6:01
The cost of acquiring a b2c customer in a local market might be around $100, right?
And so, you can see these things kind of in a factor of the factors of 10, right?
And so, any hook, the reason that like when you get good enough for growth, it means for me, I would like to look at this is my metric, at least a 10 to 1 return from cost of acquisition to lifetime value.
6:27
Now, that doesn't mean up front, all right?
It's really clear.
It doesn't mean up front now.
I mean, perfect world.
I'd like to be 20 or 30 or 40.
The the LTV to CAC ratio.
For Jim launch, for example is 30 3 2 1.
All right?
So we spend for every dollar we spend in marketing, we get $33 back over the lifetime of the customer.
6:49
Now that being said because we knew our metrics I actually lost money or often lose money in the first one, to two months, but I'm okay with that because I Have I just know the longevity of the customers worth and all that kind of stuff, right?
And so many people are coming to me, like, how can I achieve this level of growth said?
7:07
Well, we made our customers worth more to us than to anyone else.
By a very, very wide margin, right?
For the same people who are trying to compete for Jim's.
Most of their LTD was five to six thousand dollars, right?
Which is what the the vast majority of, you know, agencies gurus coaches, whatever that's most typically that's around where their lifetime value is, right.
7:28
And so they're spending Thousand bucks, and they're making six.
And that's, that's where they're at.
And they have trouble scaling from there and usually marketing, you know, represents twenty to thirty percent of their total costs every month.
Whereas, for us, it represents less than 5% of our of our total revenue, right?
And so, that's what I'm looking at the back end.
7:45
Okay?
On the front end, what I'm looking to do is how can we get more customers?
All right?
And so again, one of these things is simply spending more on marketing for many times, will accomplish that, right?
A lot of A very limiting beliefs about how many people you can acquire on a specific Channel.
8:03
All right?
I had a call recently with one of the agencies that we work with on the software side and they're like, I'm really afraid that I've tapped out this market right there in a market that's bigger than Jim's, I'll just put it that way and there's there's hundreds, probably thousands, maybe 1,000 agencies that serve this one particular Avatar, right?
8:23
And this client was selling about 20 of these a month.
All right.
And so for me it's always Ways laughable because Tony clients a month in a Marketplace that has you know a hundred thousand clients is is just like come on like there's another 100 agencies that are also selling five ten people a month.
8:44
So there's no.
So there's a thousand of these of these.
Let's say chiropractors for example that are getting sold every month and you're selling 20 of them and you think that you are now tapping out the marketplace right?
So there's usually a ton more growth that you can have in a specific Channel than you expect, right?
8:59
Right?
So that's the first thing.
They'll look is like, okay, if the LTV on the backside looks right then I'll focus on the front end and where most people get weird, is that they say cool?
Well I've got this machine to make more money.
I'm going to do, I'm going to serve another type of customer.
I'm going to go Downstream going to go Upstream.
9:16
I'm going to, I'm going to.
I'm going to also work with another type of thing, right?
I'm going to go from Fitness the sports performance.
I'm gonna go from FEMA, we lost the male weight loss, I'll go whatever.
Right?
So a different customer because they only have one channel and they don't know how to scale it, right?
And so the the way of scaling adequately, this is why this is one of the biggest mistakes that I made early on a gym launches that I just didn't know how I could scale past the amount of sales that we were coming in.
9:42
So I was like, well the only thing I can really do is is ADD supplements on top and so there's actually a clear strategic meeting where we did the pros and cons of going, Jim launch International.
So that means Jim launch China.
Jim launch southeast Asia.
Jim launch South America right versus starting.
9:59
The supplement company.
And to me starting The Southern Company, honestly, just sounded easier.
And so rather than stick with the core Avatar and simply do more, bring more customers in, by opening up more markets which I could have done, right?
10:18
I ended up adding complexity to business.
Now it probably took me a year to re simplify that business but that was a year of growth that I lost.
Hey guys, real quick.
If you're new to the podcast, I have a book on Amazon called 100 million-dollar offers that over eight thousand five star reviews.
10:35
It has almost a perfect score.
You can get it for 99 cents on Kindle.
The reason I bring it up is that I put over a thousand hours in the writing that book and it's my biggest gift to our community.
So it's my very Shameless way of trying to get you to like me more and ultimately make more dollars to that later on in your business career I guess a partner with you.
10:51
So that's my give go check it out Amazon and back to the show.
Right.
And so there's multiple ways that I could have gone through.
Like if I could go back in time, this is what I would have done.
All right?
Number one, is I Rove looked at other acquisition channels so I would have prioritized getting Channel Partners, all right, which is people who can refer you business on a regular basis.
11:15
Second would be going International so that's another way of scaling here.
I would have the same channel so that might be like Facebook or Instagram right?
But I've been doing it another Marketplace.
All right, so it would be a way of scaling.
I could find channel Partners in the United States who own lists of gym owner.
11:33
So that would be equipment dealers, flooring people, shoot, you know, financing companies, crms that serve Jim's.
All of these are people who serve the same.
Customers me that could have certain that would have been.
It would have been beneficial for them and me for their clients to work with me because they knew that their clients would stay longer.
11:51
They be more profitable and far less likely to go out of business and set it right?
Or don't make more money and then buy more stuff because they'll be grown Right?
So those are examples of just like two ways.
Another way I could have done, it would have been, you know, focusing all in on email outbound or cold calling outbound or cold Messenger, right?
12:09
All of these are different channels that I could have used to scale the front end of acquisition.
Now, we're this gets really interesting is that when I was in the room with the, the guys who are doing, half a million to our have a billionaire, excuse me, you would be astonished at how simple most of their business.
12:27
Are the bigger the business is typically the simpler it has to be because simple as the only thing that scales.
And so basically, once they've created The Mousetrap once they have LTE, that is good enough, right?
Then really, it becomes Skilling acquisition.
Now, many times people have a really fucked-up back end and you have to fix that, right?
12:45
But once once this is good enough, right?
Once we know that, let's say a small business owner that walks through this mousetrap, whether it could, it could be an agency could be Consulting business me information.
Right.
But if the back and let's say is making is twenty thousand dollars on average.
13:02
Just say we'll just use that twenty thousand dollars and we know that the cost of acquisition for a small business owner is going to be around 1,000 bucks around $1500.
Right then we can get to work.
Knowing what that cost of acquisition is and see if we can match that.
13:18
Another Channel typically outbound is actually cheaper than inbound.
Believe or not, it's skills more slowly but in some cases that can be good because Then it just allows you to appropriately.
Scale your back-end.
One of the blessings and curses of inbound Legion is that you can, you know, 4X overnight.
13:35
Whereas, you know, scaling all of the people who fulfill the services for x and that overnight, sometimes you need more difficult, right?
And so, back in this up, if I'm looking at a business owner, who's coming in and says, hey, I'm currently at, I'll give you a realtor example, I had one the other day.
13:51
This wasn't a 50 Consulting, this is for all the agencies that are doing a hundred thousand dollars a month or more using I work with them for 30 minutes to kind of help them with their business.
And so one of the things, this is a real example.
So they were doing 200 thousand a month and they want to get to a million dollars below, right?
14:10
And so, I think they were selling, I'll just use rough math, they were selling 30 people a month.
Okay, so there's some 30 people a month, and their current lifetime value was twelve thousand dollars, okay?
So, if they're selling 30 and their lifetime value is 12, then it means that if nothing changes in the business, they're currently on a growth trajectory because they were doing 200, all right?
14:32
That means and they've been growing since I've been with us, right?
And so that means that if they don't do anything, they'll cap out at 360, right?
Which is just 12 times 30.
That's it with a zero, right?
It's always.
So it means that they're going to cap at 360 per month which is well short of where they want to be.
And so the question is how do we triple the business?
14:50
All right, to get to the million dollars a month which is what they decided was their goal.
And so we look at that like okay well Currently using this one channel, they're using Facebook, all right?
And I said, I think you could reasonably get to 60 on this one channel Without Really breaking a lot of stuff, just increasing your ads.
15:07
Been adding one or two sales people, right?
That seems simple.
Now on the back end, if we can do these two things, we can raise this price by 25% and we can ask people to, you know, open more availability and we can do acting or whatever.
So that the steps that I have for them.
15:23
Right.
I think that reason we get from 12K to 16k.
All right?
Which is not.
A massive increase and you'll notice that when we're doing these things, we're tweaking it's very rare that there's like a huge under hall or overhaul the entire model.
It's usually small adjustments, right?
And so let's let's let's Factor the example in.
15:39
So if we go from 12 K to 16k, when we take the acquisition on the front end from 30 to 60 and they actually had an organic method they had stopped doing that was generating them.
I think it was ten ten or fifteen your customers month.
They stopped doing that to do the inbound agent, right?
15:56
And so we said cool.
We'll work.
The actual plan was we're going to increase your inbound Legion by 50% because you're going to have some your the cost actually ends up going up when you scale just left, why FYI?
But we're also going to restart this outbound method, right?
And so, they're going to get 15 here and go from 30 to 45 and so total deaf 60, new sales per month, reliably, and now in the back end, we're just doing these small things to take us from 12 to 16.
16:22
And so if we go 60 times 16 now we're at 96.
Tea.
And just like that from those two tweaks were able to get them to close to a million dollars a month, right?
And so that was literally like that.
What I'd walk you through, is pretty much what these, you know, massive Consulting things look like.
16:42
And the objective for me is to not give someone a hundred things to do.
But one or two things they're going to have the most leverage right in the definition of Leverage is something that has a smaller input than it does output, right?
And that's why you can have, you know, the biggest lever in the world, you could do you.
You live long enough, you can be the world.
16:58
That's the that's the objective.
When we're going to these things is like, how can I create the most leverage for the person that I'm talking to and looking at how they can skill acquisition and then how we can simplify make the back and more profitable, right?
And so when you're looking at your business or I find this useful when I look at my business is I'm saying okay do we is the back and metrics in terms of what we're making per customer?
17:20
What our turn is?
What our pricing is, you know what percentage of people are taking the upsells, all of those things are.
They write.
Are they good enough?
Yes.
Okay, I'm comfortable at this number.
Let's say it's 15.
It doesn't matter.
You could you can add zeros, remove zeros if it's fifteen hundred dollars is your cost of as your lifetime value or cost of Acquisitions $100.
17:41
Then you're at 12:45 and that's awesome.
Right?
Same thing and so, just looking at the Arbitrage between these two things and in general the greater the Arbitrage, as in the greater, the difference between the cost of acquisition and the lifetime value, then the more money you'll ultimately make the more popular make and Fit is what begets growth, right?
17:59
A lot of people want to get bigger in order to get better, but usually it's getting better.
That allows you to get bigger as and you need to have lots of profit in order to scale rather than say I'm going to put all my profit back and not take it, not have a big margin in my business because I want it to grow and it's backwards.
18:18
You have to have lots of margin in order for the business to grow rather than think.
I don't want to have any margin because I want to make it affordable to everyone so that it Grows and eventually I'll start making money, whatever you scale expanse.
So if you have low margin your just scaling low margin for the most part.
18:35
There's a handful of exceptions but the vast majority of people who are probably listening to this have what I would consider normal businesses that have services and employees that have to scale as the product scales, right?
And an exception to that would be, you know, if you had an app or some sort of software and that's why software gets, you know, has as crazy multiples, but it's also a very hard business, a very competitive.
18:55
So, anyway, Back to the knee point, the numbers that you need to look at.
And the three numbers that I'm looking at are if you're looking if you're curious really want to do this.
Mental example, with your own, your own team is, what's my lifetime value?
What's my cost of acquisition?
And if you're worried about cash, then what's my 30-day LCB?
19:14
What's my what am I?
What am I collecting in the first 30 days of the customer?
And that's if your cash constrain, if you're not cash constrained, then you really just looking at cost of acquisition compared to lifetime value, all right?
And so in looking, Looking at that, it simply becomes a factor factor of how much more can I bring in the front end.
19:33
Once these back metrics are correct rather than adding more businesses, adding more services serving more avatars, which is the mistake that I made.
And this mistake that many people you know who are entrepreneurs will make.
Because I think that if I just said cool we're at X in flow per month, from this channel.
19:51
We're going to add, we're going to take the next three months and folks on Partners.
I'll Focus the next three month on YouTube or hooks the next 3 months.
On building out them, right, whatever it is, right.
I would have been able to continue to add channels and go from and literally triple the business that way rather than trying to add more things on the back.
20:09
Right.
So hopefully, that makes sense.
That is the process that I go through.
Those are the two sides of the coin or the of the equation for growth.
I hope you find that valuable for me, it was very eye-opening.
I wish I could transfer like that.
The Simplicity that I've seen from people have the biggest businesses but basically once You have a product that has a very, it is very well wild very well.
20:32
Oiled machine in the back end, it's it takes a tremendous amount of effort to change your machine, right?
And so, in those instances, once it's good enough, you can always make the tweaks and whatnot, but, like, fundamentally changing or overhauling.
The machine takes a lot of work and takes a lot of time.
20:47
Right?
Also has certain amount of risk.
Whereas, if you can just focus on like take your entrepreneurial add hat and instead of trying to use your add hat on figure, To be product or figuring out a new Avatar or anything like that.
T crunch Milady and learn another acquisition Channel and let that be the focus of your entrepreneurial, you know, distracted, nice and shiny object.
21:11
So I hope that makes sense.
Hope you enjoy the hook for that valuable.
If you did please drop a like or drop a question and I will try to answer all of them as they come in.
So I love stay amazing.
Found this valuable we review and I'll get you guys some clips that have Saturday but

Most Nation real quick.

0:17
It gets kind of sobering when you think about think about it like that.
But the reason that I like to bring it up is because there's two ways you can use that number to quantify what activities you want to engage, welcome to the game, where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to Make more per customer and how to keep them longer in the many failures and lessons.
0:33
We have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe.
What's going on?
Everyone?
Happy Tuesday.
I've got a fun mental activity for us, planned around, hourly rates.
So one of the interesting things about being entrepreneurs that we don't always know what our hourly rate really is right?
0:49
We like to say we make extra or whatever it is right.
But do you really know what your true Ally rate is?
It's not your Revenue right?
It is your profit.
And so a quick back of napkin We Le can get you to your true.
Hourly rate is and so if you ask and I'm going to record this is on, hey how much do you make some of them just respond with Revenue which is funny.
1:08
Others will respond with profit and then they have some sort of caveat of like well I invested a lot back in the business this year, blah blah, blah dry the reasons why she isn't as high as a shoe, right?
But let's just talk about reality not fantasy.
So in your last 12 months, if you look at what you made, right, let's say you made 50,000 dollars in the last 12 months.
1:27
All right?
Now, if you take that number, And divide it by two thousand which is roughly a 40-hour workweek.
Now, here's where it gets interesting.
Is that if you think that you work 80 hours a week, then it actually doubles in you're caught you're making per hour Cuts in half.
And so let's just use that example first with 40 40 hours a week, which 2012 Ruffalo, right, that means you make $25 per hour.
1:50
Now, if you work 60 hours a week, you make something like 17 and a half dollars per hour.
If you work, if you work, if you work 80 hours a week, Then you actually make $12 an hour, it gets kind of sobering when you think about think about it like that.
2:06
But the reason that I like to bring it up is because there's two ways you can use that number to quantify what activities you engage it.
Right.
And so the first is, I see a lot of entrepreneurs is sometimes even earlier on kind of boosting their egos and saying, I'm not going to do that work.
That work is beneath me, right?
2:22
The thing is if you actually look at the numbers it's actually not going to eat them.
It actually it might be higher than what they're currently making and so being fundamentally aware of what you're currently.
Make for our, I think, is a first at least quantifying how much the value of your time is, right?
The next thing is that it also allows you to draw a line in the sand and say over time, I want to decrease the activities that I could replace with someone else doing this for me for less than what I currently make per hour and over time the level of my activities should rise, right?
2:49
Because if you're fundamentally not stopping working anytime soon, right?
Then what you're doing is you're sending up the ladder of skill set, right right now, like the first thing that many people have to Outsource in a East line service is just the actual low-level fulfillment of what they're doing, right?
Right after that.
3:05
The next thing, they all sorts of probably be some sort of administrative activities that are associated with that.
The next level of of that might be financial and billing, and collections, all that kind of stuff.
And then above that, you might have sales, right?
And then above that, you might have marketing and marketing related activities, the prospect right?
3:22
And so, all of these activities that you're doing have a certain quantifiable value that you can ascribe compared to your hourly rate, another One thing about the hourly rate is, you can also start quantifying your purchase it in reverse in terms of time.
And so, I know that when I was starting out, I would think like, I actually remember this specifically.
3:38
I had I worked at Smoothie King and I was making 675 an hour.
Alright, I was 15 or 16 years old.
And I remember that.
All my co-workers would always go right next door to Quiznos.
I choose glucosamine and get lunch and they would drop between, you know, 10, 15 bucks on lunch.
3:54
And the thing is that our shifts were six hours and so we would make Let's say, 40, 40 bucks Top Line, right?
And then, after taxes, we'd make even less than let's say, you know, we, let's see what they took 25% of that, right?
And so, we now are only making $30 for this whole shift, right?
4:13
And half of that.
Every single one of them would use when they go and bought lunch.
And some, like, if I go here and I get lunch every time, I'm here, then I'm literally only making $15 for six hours of my time.
This doesn't feel worth it to me and yet I see entrepreneurs do this all the time.
4:29
I'm and so if you look at your purchases, if you look at your real hourly rate and then you look at the purchases that you make, would you then say I would spend four hours of my time working to get that a lot of times it's sobering, you're like no I actually wouldn't do that.
And it'll help you keep your budget in check for you're looking at spending money.
4:50
Wheel clockwise you guys already know that I don't run any ads on this and I don't sell anything.
And so, the only ask that I can ever have you guys that you help me, spread the words we cannot more entrepreneurs, make more money, feed their families, make better products and have better experiences for their employees and customers.
The only way we do that is if you can rate and review and share this podcast, so the single thing that I have to do is you can just leave review but they can 10 seconds or one type of the thump.
5:14
It means the absolute world to me.
And more importantly, it may change the world for someone else.
The other real interesting piece about this is kind of what I was touching on earlier.
We related to Ego is that a lot?
It's just so many times.
5:30
We don't want to do activities, that we know will generate money, because we have some sort of ego associated with it.
And I think one of the reasons that that we that I, you know, that we've been able to do, well, was not being egotistical about the work that I was going to do, right?
And so when I had my gym tonight, six of them, I still was selling every day because I knew what I mean, For our and I knew that on average per hour.
5:53
I'd make $500 an hour when I was selling.
And so I wanted to maximize as many hours of my time selling because I knew I was making less than that, doing anything else?
And so, I see people right now who don't want to take sales calls way too soon because like, they're not like you, you don't have the bandwidth, you don't have the margin, you don't have the padding to Outsource your sales so soon instead Outsource everything else, that's not revenue-generating So that you can focus all of your time on that thing.
6:22
Until eventually, you acquire the next skill set that you can bring someone else in and you have enough margin, you have enough padding so that you can take a decrease in sales because when someone comes in the most expensive part of sales is that I'm not selling, that's the cost of getting some annuities, the Lost opportunities, the revenue that you should have made that, you would have made if you had been selling.
6:43
And so, I like to putting this in a big bow in terms of number one first.
Quantify how much you actually we make per hour in the real world.
Number two, and you do that first on 2000 hours, but then you can do second on how many hours we actually worked on the board?
Then next reverse quantify, your purchases quantify, your purchase in terms of how much time it would cost you to get that thing.
7:04
And are you still willing to put that much time forward to get that thing?
A lot of times, you're not and the next piece of this is making sure that when you look at all the activities that you're doing and easy.
Way of doing this is doing a Time study, which every time I've done a Time study, I always tell myself I'm gonna do it again every month that I don't, but I do, Doing one like once a quarter or twice a year.
7:22
But what you do is you just have an Excel sheet you printed out, and you have the times of day broken in a 15 minute increments and you just write down what you did for each of those 15 minutes, right?
And you can see what types of activities, you're spending your time doing.
If you think this will take you time, it will save you so much time and productivity, I promise you that the 10 minutes of actual writing that it will cost you will cost.
7:42
You far less than the amount of time that you want to now, get credit for working well and working efficiently.
All right boom.
You do that really want to see what types of activities you do.
And then more readily outsourced, the ones that are lower.
Because ultimately, if you think about the entrepreneurial Journey from a, from a, from a spiritual standpoint from skill, standpoint is that all we're doing is is practicing higher level skills at with more and more leverage, right?
8:04
First.
We're doing the things that we're managing people who do the things, then we're leading people who manage people who do the things, and then we're simply thinking and guiding things strategically.
And at this level what you're really doing is guiding the culture and attracting talent that is going to be able to do the For you at a high level and ideally at a higher level than you could even do them.
8:24
And that is where you can get to the level of like true ownership, chairman of the board shareholder investor, because that is where you're doing the highest skill activities with relation to your time.
And so anyways understanding the magic behind your hourly they is a great place to either sober you up to the reality.
8:40
Instead of always paschim how much money you make.
And simply like, this is what I actually make anything that's below this, I shouldn't do.
But anything that is above this, I should do, right?
And then over time out, Outsourcing the activities from bottom top of what you can replace at market value for an equivalent level of service.
8:57
So anyways, hope that was valid before you.
If you think that was useful, please drop a comment or like, show friends and all that good stuff.
So have an amazing Tuesday because you guys soon lots of love.

What's going on, everybody?
I'm bringing some more books, but I wanted to say that, if you haven't checked out Hunter million-dollar offers, I would definitely suggest that you start there.

So enjoy that and let's start the podcast.
I think The More We As Leaders can consistently practice this trait, the more breakthroughs will be able to help our teammates have and ultimately, the faster, the communication will happen.
0:40
Welcome to the game, where we talk about, how to get more customers, how to make more per customer and how to keep them longer and the many failures and lessons, we have learned along the way.
I hope you enjoy and subscribe, what's going on over on?
Happy Saturday, the third time's the charm, we're trying.
This new podcast set up hopefully to get you guys.
0:57
Some better audio and so we got Fancy ass Mike here which looks nice and fancy.
And so hopefully you guys can hear me in deep rich audio.
And so what I wanted this podcast to be about was was gossip.
And the reason I wanted to talk about gossip is because I actually think it's one of the most powerful forms of communication that humans do especially people who are not good communicators, right?
1:23
And that's why I wanted to talk about it because I think it's one of the ways that you can actually harness and Advance as an individual.
Both in a I'm in management and Leadership if you are a leader you know, in your own company, if you're obviously entrepreneur than you are a leader.
But even if you're listening, this is an employee.
This is like this realization for me has been really big and so we just had our strategic meet up this last week.
1:45
And obviously, when you have lots of people who get into a room, inevitably there's back channels and, and side conversations that end up happening about performance about attitude, about Behavior even about habits, right of other people in the team.
And, you know, we had we have a no gossip policy at our company.
2:05
But what's interesting is that if you I think if you flip how you perceive gossip, you can actually harness it into one of the most powerful forms of authentic communication.
And so, what I mean by that is like if you think about what gossip is that it's very basic route.
It's two people being transparent about someone else when that person is not there and typically it's something that is negative or something that they don't want that.
2:29
Person to know.
They are saying about that, right?
But if you think about what is actually being said, if you were to wash the intention behind it and simply extract, what is being said about this person?
It's like well, you know, John 2, John can't delegate anything.
2:45
Like he just he holds everything and he slows the whole team down, right?
You know, Nancy.
So - right like, she's like she just hopped on and sometimes I'm like, jeez.
Like, you know, be nice for once.
Gosh, like we're on the same team, right?
You sure these side conversations and up.
Nothing like the gossip, but those gossip nuggets are a gift not for the people having the gossip.
3:07
But for the person that the gossip is about, right?
And the reason that this type of communication proliferates, in my opinion, is because people are so starved of real authentic communication, right?
Like most people suck at communicating, most people don't have real relationships with their spouses, most people don't have real relationship with their boyfriends, their girlfriends, most people Don't have actual relationships with anyone, which is why so many people feel.
3:34
So lonely, is because they are so afraid of saying, what they actually think, right?
And so, under the guise of Gossip, where the two people gossiping don't talk to each other, about what they think about one another, they talk to each other, but they think about another person, right?
3:50
But it shows to me that everyone has the capacity for authentic communication.
Everyone has everyone has the thoughts of what they really think.
They're just a Afraid to tell the person because they are afraid of what would happen.
But within the context of a business within the context of a marriage within the context of any relationship in my opinion, if you can, if you can, if you can bring that person who you're gossiping about into the fold, everyone gets stronger, right?
4:18
It doesn't do anyone any good to gossip, which is why we have no gossip policy, but it does everyone a world of good.
If the two people who are gossiping about the third person, bring the third person in and then you have a a dialogue and you say, Nancy, you're really fucking - Holy shit like no - then Nancy either gets to say, I've had such a hard week like my you know, my kids am I just had a newborn kid and it's keeping me up and I'm so sorry.
4:43
I didn't know that you felt that way.
Now I feel horrible, right?
And you have this ability to have a genuine conversation, right?
Are or John?
Dude, your bottlenecking, everyone.
Like you're you're holding on to all these tasks and you're not delegating any of them and John's like oh my God, I didn't I didn't know.
5:01
I thought you guys were so busy.
I didn't want to give anything to you.
Sighs.
So, I just hold on to it for myself because I was trying to be a good teammate and everyone's like, no, dude, you're not being a good teammate.
Like you're slowing the entire company or the entire department down because you won't delegate stuff off your plate.
It's like, I didn't know, right?
