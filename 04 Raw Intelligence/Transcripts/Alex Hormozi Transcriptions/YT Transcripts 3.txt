(00:00) this one equation will make you rich I recently spoke at adworld if you stayed at the very end you'll understand how you can use the equation to sell lots of stuff or lots of money and make yourself unreasonably wealthy keep being awesome and enjoy big picture there's two things that I want to talk about one is how do you create and sell valuable things right you probably hear people say hey like provide more value give value away like it's all about value value but like no one defines what is value what does
(00:22) that even mean right what are the components that create a more or less valuable product or service the second part is one of the four different things that you can do to enhance value all right so once you have a valuable thing you can enhance it by adding scarcity you can enhance it by adding urgency you can enhance it by adding bonuses or you can enhance it by adding guarantees and you can also as a fifth half bonus for you guys you can enhance the value by simply naming it in a way that resonates more with your avatar or the type of
(00:48) person you want to sell to okay and so if those are the five things that can enhance the value of the thing that you're selling if you have all five and you do them well you will sell more than you would if you didn't have them now I won't have time to get in all five I'm just going to talk about one of them which is guaranteed it's a big picture we're gonna talk about how to create and Destroy value in the things that we sell and we'll talk about how to reverse risk through guarantees to make the things that we are selling more compelling to
(01:09) them because now they won't fear that they're not going to get the outcome that we promised cool awesome I spent a very long time trying to figure out what value meant and it's because I we worked with a lot of portfolio companies and we want to think about how we can create new product offerings that are going to be that are going to sell for lots of money with big margins uh and make us all rich right I wanted to come up with an equation that would encapsulate this so that we could basically formulate or formulatically approach the problem so
(01:34) it's like if we check these boxes we're going to get something valuable then we can just do this over and over and over again and I had to do it that way because I can't be the person who's making the products in every one of these companies at this point is I have to create a process around it okay the four variables are as follows so if you're taking notes or you have something on your side screen this is the these are the writer downers number one is the dream outcome is the thing that we are promising something that
(01:54) people actually want all right I'm going to dive into each of these four in a second but I'll just give you the four and then we'll we'll double click all right so that's number one and when you're writing these down write it down like a fraction so draw a line right in the middle of your paper or whatever and you'll have two on the top and two on the bottom so number one is your dream outcome number two is the perceived likelihood of achievement How likely does someone believe that if they purchase your thing they're going to
(02:17) achieve the outcome that we are promising a lot of words hopefully a simple concept number three is the time component in essence how quickly are they going to get the thing after they pay the fourth is the dual-sided coin of effort and sacrifice what does someone have to start doing that they don't want to do as a result of this purchase and then what are the things that they have to stop doing that they would like to keep doing that they cannot no longer do as a result of this purchase all right so those are the four things and what
(02:44) I'd like you to do in thinking through this as we break it down is think about your own products and services that you have and think about how they Stack Up in using this equation all right I'm going to give you a big picture back and forth example and then I'm going to dive into each of them in more detail if we were to think about an ideal outcome all right so let's use weight loss because it's an example that most people can understand all right so why is it that let's say you have some things that you can sell for weight loss like fifty
(03:09) thousand dollar surgeries for liposuction and on the other hand you've got a five dollar ebook that promises a skinny tummy if they make the same promise right which is the dream outcome number one how is these two things are so different in price right well it's the other three variables right because the dream outcome people want to lose weight right and so that's unit number one now the reason that that is number one of the four is that if I were to say hey I can make you a million dollars versus losing weight most people many
(03:39) men especially would probably value making money more than they would value losing weight not always but oftentimes as a category investment things franchise opportunities business opportunities tend to sell for a higher price which is the kind of the component of B2B business to business versus business consumer by and large when you have two different things like that we use the dream outcome to differentiate entire Industries or category worries of products as being more or less expensive now once we have the same dream outcome
(04:07) like weight loss being delivered then we move on to the other three parts of the equation let's go on to perceive likelihood of achievement if I have two people who are selling the same exact thing let's use a doctor in that weight loss example like the liposuction guy and let's say that liposuction guy a doctor has done 10 000 surgeries of liposuction and let's say Dr B has done one same surgery same dream outcome it's going to take the same amount of time same amount of effort for you this guy might even spend more time on you than
(04:35) this guy because he's not his experienced which one are you going to go with probably the 10 000 guy why because of the perceived likelihood of achievement we have lower risk associated with making this purchase because we believe that if we give this money we're going to have the outcome that we desire and so if you think through this in terms of your own products you're like am I doing a good of job before the purchase of increasing someone's perceived likelihood of achievement because in a very real way that confers itself or it
(04:58) translates into higher prices this guy even though it probably sticks it takes him less time to do the surgery you actually can charge more than this guy isn't that wild so we've got the dream outcome is the thing something people actually want what's the perceived likelihood of achievement now if we stop there between making big promises and making people believe that it's actually going to happen for them that is what the majority of young and new entrepreneurs spend their time on most people myself included spent the first
(05:22) half two-thirds of my career trying to beef up the top side I would promise bigger and I would show more testimonials more results promise bigger more testimonials more results right more third party identification more celebrity endorsements Etc right but I believe now now I've done this a little bit that the actual fortunes rely on the bottom side of the equation okay so remember this is the top side that creates value the bottom side of this fraction are the things that destroy value our goal is to increase the top
(05:46) side and decrease the bottom side so with time there's two components of time we have the time delay between when you buy and when you get and then the amount of time to immediately start seeing any kind of outcome so it's like the experience along with so for example if I signed up for a gym membership right using this weight loss example I might know that I'm not going to lose the weight for a year but if I start seeing value from the community I start you know feeling more upbeat et cetera I'm going to start experiencing benefits
(06:13) that might not be my big goal but I'm going to have other things along the way that are going to still deliver value quickly the whole component of time here is how quickly between when I buy and when I get I'll give you a B2B example in a b2c example in a B2B example let's say you own a marketing firm so this is Admiral so I'm sure audit this will resonate with a lot of you guys if you have two agencies that are side by side and they both say hey I'm going to do some marketing for you and I'm going to get your phone to ring one way or
(06:36) another marketing agency a says okay now that we're doing this you're going to have to start you know recording lots of ads for us and we're going to be meeting three times a week an hour each time and you're probably gonna take four hours a week to record these these ads for us and it's going to take us 60 days to get this stuff done at day 60 your phone starts ringing from the ads that they do okay marketing age number two you sign the paper and as soon as you sign the paper and they process your credit card
(07:00) your phone rings and it's a lead within seconds same product time collapse and so one of the easiest things I had a mentor once say this he said one of the easiest ways to figure out what product to sell is look at the products everyone else is selling and deliver the same thing in half the time and so when we think about the products that we sell is there a way that we can condense TTV which is time to value and so one of the key one of the huge ways that we focus on when we bring a portfolio company in acquisition.com is
(07:25) we say how can we look at this this Service delivery and see if we can do it faster now before the people who are in the room who are like well my business is different we have a company that publishes books for God's sake so a very long process but what we were trying to figure out because they're the same situation where it's like it just takes time for someone to like write a book like how can we deliver this value faster and so the thing is is it just like that gym example that I said it's not that you necessarily have to deliver
(07:49) the longest result first but you want to deliver a result first you want to have a tangible outcome that someone can experience literally holding their hands and so one of the things that they did was created a little seven day kind of mini book boot camp and when they did that people at the end of seven days could have an actual mini book published and live now they make it clear this is not the book that's going to make you a millionaire but what it was was to break the belief and to prove the concept that they could
(08:15) really do it and then they got the bind and really built the you know the real book that was going to end up making the money Etc right and so the idea here is that if you are creative and if you are a loser then don't think this way but if you are a winner there's always the question which is how can I make this work for me all right and so you have to think if like if you're a real estate agent you're like well it takes 90 days to sell a house how can you give someone an outcome before that it's like well
(08:34) what else happens they have to clean the house they have to inspect the house they have to they want to know about ways to make more value there's Lawn Care there's fixes there's a million things that have to happen is there other things that I can do along this journey that I can provide more value to this person earlier so they can get better experience in a b2c example let's say uh I'm on the internet and I'm trying to buy something for weight loss right it and I click the button that says six minute abs and then six minutes
(08:54) later I have abs how like literally I look at my shirt like holy how valuable would whatever that thing be if in six minutes I would have abs probably infinitely valuable and so when we can find ways to deliver the outcomes to our customers sooner or faster they will value it a lot more not just a little bit more a lot more speed is one of the best all-time competitive advantages and so the last one is effort and sacrifice so I said it's two sides of the same point because when you take on a new customer you have to have that
(09:24) they have to start doing things that they weren't doing before right that's effort they didn't and they probably don't want to do it because they weren't doing it before which is why they don't want to do it right and on the flip side they've got stuff that they stop doing that they do want to do right and that's why they're two sides at the same point in that market example I just gave with the agency right let's say marketing agency A and B and I said a had you know you have to three three meetings a week
(09:44) and you've got four hours to deliver us copy and creative and whatever right versus the other agency that's like oh we've already tested all the stuff for your industry and we've got videographers and whatnot who can who can already just start running the stuff like you just pass and it's taken care of how much more valuable is the guy who takes none of your effort and sacrifice takes no effort on your part to make this outcome occur so if you're thinking about this within your own business the way that we like to think about these
(10:10) four four variables right when we have the effort and sacrifice the goal just like time is to decrease it and if we're repeating the same activities with every one of our customers how can we streamline that how can we predict what that what is going to happen and how can we how can we make you know three onboarding calls into one and how can we make one onboarding call into a checklist so how can we streamline this process such that it's seamless and effortless and ideally immediate for them to achieve the result all right and
(10:36) so I said there's four four variables in the value equation you've got a big dream outcome that people want to experience they believe that the likely that they're going to experience it is very high the time that they have to wait between when they buy and when they get is as little as possible and then the effort and sacrifice is zero and when you put those four things together you have a very valuable product and so when I said that this the bottom half of the equation is the more valuable thing that as I've learned is
(10:59) that a lot it's very easy to make bigger promises and you know throw testimonials and things like that it's much harder to actually have the operational effectiveness to drive results faster and decrease the amount of effort that a customer has to put forth and so the competitive modes that exist in the big businesses are on the bottom side of the equation Netflix took over Blockbuster because they made consumption of movies and TV shows immediate and your effort and sacrifice if you didn't have to get up in your car drive around the corner
(11:24) 15 minutes walk around grab the thing and then not to mention return it three days later which is zero value add to you right without getting your late fee they just got rid of all of that so you could just take your phone and start watching but the actual dream outcome and perceived likelihood on both of those occasions that people thought they were going to watch a movie or watch a TV show and they're very certain they wanted to do it right so like the top side was the same the bottom side of the equation is where they killed everyone
(11:48) if you look at Amazon they made the purchasing process seamless on two angles if I can click with one button and it comes tomorrow they made the effort sacrifice virtually nothing in terms of the purchasing and then the time delay is virtually nothing in terms of getting the thing and they continue to shrink that time Gap they sell the same products as everyone else literally but what did they do they increase the perceived likely of achievement by adding all the reviews so people believe that when they buy the thing they're
(12:11) going to get the outcome they really want the job they hired the product to solve they believe they have when they have that because of the reviews that Amazon leaves right the time because they get it immediately and it's and they can buy it quickly and the same thing with the effort and sacrifice right and so that's ultimately how Amazon is able to beat because they provide value all right is this making sense this is cool you guys digging this okay I'll give you one cool benefit of that four-part stack and then I'll I'll
(12:33) segue into the guarantees portion all right so I gave you four variables guess what those four variables also equate to they equate to headlines and copy so if I want to promise something to a prospect what am I going to say here's the dream outcome here's a number that is related to the amount of people who've helped achieve this thing here's how long it took them to achieve that thing and then here are stipulations around that claim and if you have data from your customer success Department which hopefully you do right
(13:01) which is percentage of customers who maybe leave a five-star review or percentage of customers to achieve X outcome by X date under this condition now you have claims that you can use that are very compelling in your marketing and your copy these can be headlines and emails they can be headlines and ads they can be on your sales Pages they can be hooks in in your in your videos and creative content and so when you think through these four variables they are the consistent variables of claims in general so when
(13:24) you want to communicate to a chiropractor that you can help market for his facility you're going to say 70 of our chiropractors that we work with achieve over 100 patients in their first 30 days without having to make an ad effort and sacrifice and so when you do something like that you use those four parts of the equation that is also reverse Engineers copy because they should be related because value is what people want to buy and so your ability to persuade and your ability to understand and communicate value
(13:53) should be married when you're thinking about your products and services and you have these four variables you're like okay how do I do this right so the way that we think through this is that we create a big list of problems all right which is I like to think about in sequence which is what is every single mini micro step as chunked down as humanly possible that someone has to go through to experience this result so if you're in the physical products business then you're gonna that's why Amazon spent so much time on the actual
(14:15) purchasing because there's not a ton that they have to do but once the person uh receives the product what's their first impression of the Box the unpackaging the directions that that they get in order to use it what the using it experience looks like the first time the second time Etc how can we streamline that process for them how can we give them different ways that they can use the same thing right in the services side there's probably a lot more micro steps that somebody's going to have to take in order to achieve the
(14:38) outcome right and so the idea is we want to write down every single problem that could possibly encounter throughout their entire Journey with us and then we want to write out what the solution of that would look like now we're just putting we're in we're in fictitious World here we're saying you know blue ocean what would we do to solve every one of these problems right and we get this huge list a lot of guys who go through the book have a hundred plus different little mini micro problems and many micro solutions that they have now
(15:02) once you have this huge thing this is a fun activity to do with your team is how can we make the thing we sell more valuable right once you have that list you then do something I call the trim and stack which is you look at that list you say which of these is the most valuable to them which is the one they suffer the most from that is most valuable them that's category number one then next to those which of these would cost us virtually nothing to to build or Implement after we have a first time experience right so it's like if you
(15:25) have to build out like a grocery calculator it's going to take you time one time but then every time after that it's done right what's the incremental cost of each of these of each of these Solutions and so then you order those in terms of uh you I I just would go low medium high it's very simple and so then for me what we do with the companies we have is we look at the things that are high value and cost us very little to provide on increment and we cut everything else out and then we have something that's extremely valuable and
(15:50) costs us very low and that's how you have a very high value very high margin product or service that you sell that is ultimately how we recreate value in a business and we like to think about is like what are all the capacities of the business us what are all the problems they could potentially solve and then which ones will we choose to solve and then once we're very ruthlessly clear on the problems that we choose to solve we cut out everything else and say that's just not a problem we choose so we know we could solve it but just based on the
(16:12) economics of that solution or that problem we don't want to be the ones to do it and then we say ruthlessly focused on things that we do we do more of it okay now most people think that they're selling against their competition I disagree what you're really selling against is inaction you're selling against doubt you're selling against the biggest obstacle which is risk the comfort of not doing the thing or not buying the product is so high we have to help decrease their action threshold right we have to lower that bar just so
(16:38) they can just step right over it because up here they don't want to take action because it's too comfortable we have to lower it so much so there's so little friction for them to take action with us that they buy I think one of the more compelling things that a business can do is offer guarantees all right guarantees are you assuming a certain percentage of the risk from the buyer whenever there's an exchange between two parties there's a certain amount of risk that both parties incur and so if you have these
(17:00) two parties and there's a certain amount of risk that's shared you can shift the risk in your favor because you have more knowledge about the Fulfillment than the client does why because you've done this a hundred times before and this is their first time and so it would make sense that we shift some of that risk in our favor and we do that in the form of a guarantee rather than like insurance but you can think about guarantees as purchase insurance for the buyer and so there are four ways that I think through
(17:25) guarantees and creating and structuring creative guarantees the four types are unconditional guarantees which means it doesn't matter what you do if you just want your money back I'll give it back to you that is the strongest type of guarantee now depends on the type of business if you can't offer it I think you should because if you do the math on if I reverse the risk and I get 20 more sales because of this unconditional guarantee and I get five percent more refunds and not even five percent more on an increment let's just say you get
(17:50) five you go from one percent refunds to five percent refunds which would be a massive increase in refunds you still added 15 to your sales and it was still worth it mathematically that is why having the guarantee is just a math equation it's not like you can't let your emotions be like well we got our we got more refunds now it's like yeah we also got 20 more sales so you just have to think about it like that just be a business person and not emotional about it number two is a conditional guarantee which is uh we will give you X if if x
(18:16) happens y if this happens this is what we will do right if y the next very simple if you provide us content for our marketing agency Always by noon on Fridays before the ad campaign start for the first eight weeks and if you don't make at least twice what you paid us over that first eight week period we will give you your money back right you can also say we will work with you until you get your money back the third is uh an anti-guarantee which if you don't have a guarantee which there are there are situations where that that makes
(18:44) sense you want to lean into the fact that you don't have a guarantee you don't want to like not talk about it because it's a normal part of the buying process be like what are my assurances like how do I know this is going to happen you're making these promises how should I believe you right and that's where you lean in and you say oh no we don't have guarantees and if you're the type person that really needs a guarantee this is not the program for you because there's too much work that's on your on your part we can guide you
(19:02) but the vast majority of the success is going to be in your hands we will guide you but it's going to be on you and if that doesn't feel good for you then there's 100 other guys or you have some sort of proprietary thing it's like once I give you the super secret sauce you're going to know it forever and so I can't I can't give you a refund because the day after you learn a secret it's not valuable to you right and said for that reason we can't we can't uh do any kind of guarantees the fourth is what I call
(19:24) implied guarantees so anything that's a performance related offer you know we'll increase your Revenue by X and we get 20 of the increase that is that is a an implied guarantee to the buyer rev share is profit shares uh performance bonuses kickers doing things off of a strike pricing going up all of those things are implied guarantees based on performance those are the four different things that you can do in terms of guarantees now the advanced version of this is that you can stack guarantees so I can say I will
(19:51) give you a 30-day unconditional guarantee and I will give you a 90-day conditional guarantee which means that for whatever reason you're like hey I'm not sure then you say listen the only way for you to be for you to be sure is for you to be inside the program because I just want you to make an informed decision you can't make an informed decision until you've actually experienced the product I'm just going to give you a 30 day unconditional guarantee so you can get in there experience the benefits and then make
(20:11) the decision for yourself it makes it a very easy sale because then the sale becomes essentially a trial now you're going to close a lot more deals but you're also going to get more refunds but the netnet is you're going to to make more sales and so you do the unconditional guarantee and you say but on top of that and this is where you get clever is you look at the customers who've made the most money if you're B2B if you're b2c you look at the ones who've gotten the result that you that you promised the best results and then
(20:31) you look at the client Journey that they had what are the things they did who did they talk to what was their experience and so then what we do is we reverse engineer their experience the key Milestones of their experience and we make those part of the guarantee so for example if I were selling internet marketing whatever then I would say as long as you get your domain purchased and you set up a website and you spend at least one dollar in advertising or a hundred dollars in advertising if you don't get an Roi from this program by
(20:54) day 90 I will give you your money back and so we make two or three stipulations that seem very straightforward but the stipulations are the ones that we know are the ones that drive client success in so doing we basically guarantee that they will succeed which is the point of the guarantee and so we say listen if you're trying to lose weight I will give you two times what you paid me by the end of this 90 days if you show up to every one of the workouts and you send me a picture of all your meals that's it it you do that at the end of the 90 days
(21:21) I guarantee that you're going to lose you lose the weight that I promise you're going to lose and so you just look at what are the things in common that the people who are the biggest successes did and you just look at the fewest common variables because the more stipulations you add the weaker the the guarantee is going to be I'll tell you a fun one if you just want to get weird um if if for some reason you have uh any kind of like coaching or any kind of business that's like that the compliance of opening a Google doc and writing what
(21:42) you're going to do that day and at the end of the day just saying what you did over I think it's it's like six weeks uh is like one percent or two percent compliance like people just can't do it it's so simple if you want you could just say hey here's my guarantee if you just say what you're going to do and at the end of the day you say what you did for six weeks and you don't get the results then I'll give you the money back and you automatically know that 99 of people are not going to do that anyways so anyways fun one for you guys one of the
(22:07) things that people suck at with guarantees is that they say they make the guarantee amorphous they say results guaranteed what you don't want to do is say that because it's like Banner blindness everyone's heard that before and it means something different to everybody what we want to do is spell out exactly what our guarantee is and we don't even need to use the word guarantee we can just say if you don't get very specific outcome if you don't lose six inches from your waist by this time period and you asked
(22:33) I will write you a check for the difference between what you gave me and what you think it was worth you want to spell it out in common language so they understand what you're actually saying rather than saying results guaranteed if you enjoyed this stuff I have a book called 100 million dollar offers you can check it out it's 99 Cents I hope you got a good return on your attention and you can immediately use at least one or two of the things to ultimately sell more people at higher prices

(00:00) I've been in business for 13 years and since 2020 three of the companies I started have reached $100 million plus valuation here's nobas advice to help you crush 2025 my first piece of advice is set fewer goals and do less long-term planning hear me out and so this may sound contradictory to some of my content about being patient and I think long-term goals are very important but the obsession over the minutia of how you're going to get there is I believe an act of mental masturbation you try and create these massive projections that are based on hundreds of variables
(00:33) that in reality you just don't know what's going to happen and so over time I've consistantly trimmed and trimmed and trimmed our planning processes such that at this point I pretty much only care what we're going to do in the next 12 weeks and beyond that we might have one target or two Targets by the end of the year but we're not going to dedicate a lot of resources to this and this is somebody who's coming who who's a big fan of preparation but I've just found that it ended up being a huge waste of time mostly because whenever I looked at the plans that I made the year before
(01:02) one year later I was like man half this stuff isn't even relevant anymore because of new changes and conditions and so I will probably continue to lean more in this direction and I think this has become a little bit more popularized by some of the CEOs like Jensen hang who despite having Nvidia over 30 plus years has recently talked about how he basically doesn't do a lot of long-term planning because fundamentally you have things that you can do today and those are the things you begin to allocate now sometimes do what you need to do today is work for something that's going to
(01:31) happen in the future but you can only control what you do today and so I have shifted more and more in terms of what will this change about our Behavior and the rest of it I more or less toss out so let me give you a couple visuals to make this real and so the first thing is that we think that you're going to have this really neat line of how the growth is going to happen right but reality is very messy and so what's likely going to happen is that you will Flatline and then figure something out and then you'll Flatline and then figure something out and Flatline to figure something out this is what it looks like
(02:02) if you were to zoom in on this little area here right if you were to zoom in here it actually looks closer to what this is which is you have the stagnation and then you have these improvements that occur and then increase Revenue now one of the things that's also shifted my perspective on how to plan is let's say that we've got thing a thing B thing C thing D thing e that we need to do well before this I would try and you know divers you know delegate each of these things to person one person two person
(02:33) three person four person five and so on but I would say that that appears to me like I have not done my job because I need to do a better job prioritizing one of these things is the most important and if you can't decide what that is then you are not doing your job and you certainly can't expect your team to make that decision for you and so I've had to look at this and say if I could only pick one of these things and we only accomplish that thing which of these would get us closer to our vision for what the company should
(03:04) be which ones would move us the furthest forward which of these is the biggest domino and so what I've redone is I say Okay a is actually the priority I don't need to order B through C here I don't need to worry about what order these are in and then I will take 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 plus 5 and get all of these resources concentrated on solving a and then what I found is that once you solve a with all those resources because everyone's aligned then all of a sudden B happens faster C happens faster D happens faster than trying to do them all at once so let's say that you ran an agency right
(03:44) so you do meta ads for small businesses like a very typical business so if that was your business you might say okay we need to you know get more leads so that means we're going to increase ads okay that's one of the things we're going to you know increase show rate because our show up rate sucks so we're going to we're going to try and fix that we've got a hire you know a sales manager and whatever else right like you've got you've got you've got your tasks I'll just put dot dot dot dot dot dot now if this was your objective a
(04:13) good strategist says given the resources I currently have what one thing could I do that would make all of these problems disappear the good strategist would would then say well if I had a brand and I invested in my brand well would that would that accomplish my leads thing yep now I wouldn't have ads but it would accomplish my problem with getting leads now would show up rates be higher if I have a warm audience yes would my close rate be okay because everyone is being warmer probably now you might have to still hire the sales manager you can see
(04:45) how the entire Dynamic would change if only this were true and so then it follows okay well what are the resources required to make this happen and if I know what those resources are and I have those resources available then it would follow that I should do this one thing and then in so doing accomplish all of these other things as a consequence and this is why to be clear if you're like wait well they're just going to say build a better product because if you have a good product you're not going to lose people you're going to get word of mouth you're going to have higher LTV or they're just going to say you know Alex
(05:20) is just going to say build a good brand because if you build a good brand then all these other problems go away no [ __ ] that's called Leverage and so you're like no no no I don't want to do the one thing that would solve all my problems I want to try and solve each of my problems individually well that's amazing for you and you should probably get that looked at but the point is is that a good strategist has to look at all available options given the resources they have and say which one of these gets me the most and fundamentally
(05:49) that is leverage next up is the strongest force in all of business and so I believe in this so thoroughly that there are only two concepts that are embedded within the acquisition. comom logo the first is this cross here which is the supply and demand curve that exists in any Market the second part is why is this a triangle the triangle is there to exist as a full crumb for leverage and so fundamentally if you can have a supply demand curve that is dramatically in your favor that alone will dictate this if you are the only person who sells this one thing and the entire world wants it you going to make
(06:29) a lot of money money pretty much no matter what doesn't matter how good you are at Market doesn't matter how good you are at sales doesn't matter how good you are at pricing you're going to make a ton of money and so I try to think what are the fewest things that have to be true in order for me to win and I would rather just get those things right and then everything else can fall away and so think about this in sequence Supply demand is the first and most important thing as long as we have those things then if you had that hypothetical example of the entire world wants something and you're the only one who does it what's the next thing you would
(06:59) need which is Leever you would want to be able to get as much for the effort that you put in because you would get bottlenecked based on maybe your supply chain you'd have other dependencies that would prevent you from capitalizing on the opportunity that the supply and demand curve has put in front of you and so in a perfect world you have all of that and unlimited leverage and that allows you to maximally capitalize on opportunities and that is why I designed the acquisition.
(07:25) comom logo to exhibit those things now the first piece here is understanding whether your business is Supply or demand constrained and so a supply constrained business for example is one that's like cleaning like cleaners often don't have a hard time finding other businesses or other homes to do cleaning for a lot of people just don't want to do it the issue they have is finding staff who can do the cleaning with them or for them so that means that your supply side of how you can deliver to the demand is usually the issue and this
(07:58) happens a lot of times with I would consider nuisance services so services that people might know how to do but just don't want to do a different example of this in the professional setting would be like accounting firms accounting firms a lot of people don't want to hire accountants and for a big period of time in a lot of companies growth in the beginning you don't have in-house accounting and so having an out ofh housee accountant there's plenty of demand for them the issue they have is recruiting really good accountants and so yet again they are a supply
(08:28) constrained business now this works again with legal it works with high-end Consulting like if you're a very good consultant in a niche it's very like easy to get people to want to buy from you very hard to get other people to do what you can do because you're really good at this thing right and so this is very typical in a lot of businesses especially service and so that would be Supply constrainted businesses and if that is the constraint then what do we do to gain leverage over the constraint and so this is where okay is there a way that we can build a community of accountants that we can then recruit
(09:02) from is there a way that we can create some sort of environment that attracts more cleaners can our compensation structure can we have a referral system internally for our team or our employees because I know what a cleaner I know what a legal person I know what another consultant is worth to me to my business in total gross profit per year and why would I not be willing to pay 20% of that to somebody now you might do that math and be like holy cow I make 250,000 a year per new lawyer who joins my firm it' probably be a lot more than that honestly in that case then why would I
(09:34) be unwilling to spend $50,000 to go and not not only that give that $50,000 to someone on my team for bringing another great lawyer in and so this scales all the way up and all the way down based on the revenue that each of these high-end or Supply constrained employees provides the business now those are Supply constraint businesses and if you're in one of those you need to recognize it because the real businesses you're in is attracting hiring training managing and incentivizing these people to perform
(10:06) that's the real business because the demand kind of takes care of itself of course you have to do the basics but the real issue is going to be on the back end not the front end now let's flip the tables there are some businesses that are demand constrainted now demand constrainted businesses will be typically like e-commerce businesses often times software businesses specifically B2B software businesses can be demand constrained typically iCal consumer products weight loss for example is a very demand constrain business now this m sounds wild to you
(10:35) like wait I think so many people want to lose weight yeah there's just even more people who Supply it and so many different methods for doing it now again all of these things can shift right supply and demand is a curve like it can move right this is dynamic and this video exists in time and unfortunately the environments change but anybody who's been in Fitness would understand that getting customers is actually typically the hardest part finding train ERS not that hard there's lots of people that like training and they'll even do it for free same thing with musicians
(11:06) like if you teach music classes right one of the difficulties there is attracting people who want to buy music lessons but there's tons of people who play music and do it for free right and so the idea is which side of this curve are you on and then whatever that side is is asking yourself how can I gain more leverage over this problem so that I can solve it at scale once and for all rather than having to solve it continuously over and over and over again so I'll give you an example I had a a company who came out that we were looking at and they were a little bit on
(11:35) the smaller side but they were a home services company and so the issue they had is they were struggling to attract plumbers and so one of the things that we put in place for the business was well what does a plumber bring in every year and let's call it $400,000 in gross profit okay so if you have a nut of $400,000 that you know you've got the demand for they're turning away business cuz their phones ringing too much and they can't even take it what are you willing to pay one time to unlock $400,000 every year in gross profit well
(12:07) if you were to think about that like an investment right which would be like okay I've got this stock that yields $400,000 in gross profit per year to me what would I be willing to pay for it and that's every year well shoot I'd be at least willing to pay $400,000 if it was a stock right that's 100% return because next year I'm going to make $400,000 too now there is an element of risk that comes into the equation what if the person leaves what if they get fired they're not good all of those things so those are for sure there which
(12:32) means that we would then apply some sort of discount to account for that risk but I think that one of the big misconceptions that business owners have is they're not willing to pay enough for talent that is the constraint of their business like right now if you could get 10 more like if you were in a supply coning business if you could get 10 more of not not star just appropriately competent employees who could service the demand that you have would that double or triple your business if so yes what would you pay in order to double Tri your business probably a lot more than it costs you to attract those
(13:06) people cool then what do we do well the easiest thing is incentivize all the people in your existing Workforce to go do that recruiting for you too many business owners will give like a $1,000 referral bonus on something that makes $400,000 a year in gross profit well that's dumb if if I can give $25,000 away or $50,000 away and I can get it solved in a month then every month because that $400,000 doesn't happen at once it happens over this period of time and so if I can actually solve the problem two months earlier then that
(13:33) means I get get to collect $35,000 for two more months of gross profit okay so there is a Time component of this so maybe you can get the referral and maybe it does take you 6 months instead of three but you missed out on whatever that is $105,000 in gross profit that you could have had had you just been willing to pay a little bit more but still less overall and you still get to keep that person for life so you'll notice that I'm talking a lot about who in these examples and you know it's one of those big obvious TR responses that
(14:04) everyone who is a senior entrepreneur or senior investor or Warren Buffett or Steve Jobs they all say the same thing it's just about the people right bet on the jockey not the horse there's tons of isms in this world and everyone nods along but the problem is that people don't have the context to understand the levels of talent that exist and this is why these mistakes are so hard to Bear because you have to have some sort of pattern recognition of having worked with one terrible people to know how to avoid them and then secondarily what
(14:33) star Talent looks like and sometimes it takes luck in the beginning and then over time you start recognizing what that looks like so that you can do it on purpose rather than on accident and if you think about people as one of the highest leverage things you can do so think about this as hypothetical if your business had people who could do everything that currently exists and you could simply own it that would mean that you could work zero and make almost the same amount that you do now you'd only have to find someone who could do what
(14:56) you do like literally just think about what you currently make think about what you currently do if you could pay someone less than what you currently make in distributions to do 100% of what you currently do you could feasibly retire at your current income level just with that one Higher the idea of getting really good people is still undervalued in the marketplace which is why there's always an opportunity for people who know how to attract and retain the best talent there's a reason that the most expensive companies in the world in the stock market are at War for talent I
(15:27) want to say like 18 months ago one of the headlines of I think like the New York Times or something was the talent War and the whole idea was just that it's an onslaught of signing bonuses and Kumbaya and free lunch and all this stuff to try and attract the top talent because they know that the leverage of having somebody who's a 10x engineer or a 100x marketer for their business is always worth more than what they're going to pay the individual and so they're just doing everything they can to get them and this is me trying to translate that to you in terms of my emphasis over the last year or years
(15:58) that has yielded this outcome if we're thinking about more or less in terms of my focus this is one that I'm doing more of I'm more focused on Talent I'm more focused on better people fewer better people and incentivizing them and incentivizing other people to bring them in there's some semiconductor companies that are offering 3x salaries their current salary to poach people from one company to another because the cost of switching is obviously high and so if they're making more money than you you should look at what they're doing so next point up for me is of the first 100
(16:27) days this year I took zero days off and I bring this up because this is a very taboo topic and I want to be clear do whatever you want I'm just saying that when I see the entrepreneurs who were obsessed with their work they do better than people who aren't and it's basically that their discretionary time that would go to hobbies that would go to other things basically all flows into this one thing and so I'm going to paint a different picture for you if I played video games all day and someone came up
(16:58) to me and said hey why don't you go outside and I say I don't want to go outside I want to keep playing video games the thing is is that that person's making some moral judgment that I should do something that they have projected onto my life now I'm a big believer in personal freedom which is if you want to play video games every hour every day until the day you die that's your prerogative It's not how I would want to live my life but more power to you if you have an outcome that you're optimizing towards which would be Financial wealth which is kind of the point of my channel the people who work
(17:28) the most tend to make the most money and there's a number of reasons for that so number one is you make more money when you work more because you have less time to spend it that sounds obvious but I think it's like kind of silly like if you work you make more if you stop working you not only don't make you also spend so it's a it's a it's a negative to positive swing it's actually disproportionate the next thing is that um a friend of mine messaged Elon about vacations he's like hey you should you should go on vacation or we should go here for vacation and elon's response
(17:57) was I don't do vacation and I was like man I love this guy I bring this up yet again because I feel like the more you get in the game the more addicted to the game you get and I think that addiction is just a term that Society uses for activities that people do that have negative consequences rather than simply things that you do on a regular basis well I'm addicted to food because I do it every day I'm addicted to sleep because I do it every day I'm addicted to talking to Lila because I do it every day and so it's just that addictions is when they decide that the outcome of that thing is somehow negative but if the outcome of
(18:28) what I do helps more businesses grow and is something that I enjoy why is this wrong and so we did two very bad vacations this year one was in July 4th which I ended up basically just traveling and then working the whole time so I don't know if I would consider that a vacation and then the other one we went to truly do a vacation and so this one was going to be 2 days and we got there and it was this beautiful luxury resort and there's only 22 Villas it's like three or four people per Villa like very you know ritzy whatever and I look out on the patio of the Villa that
(19:00) we have over the mountains and I'm like man this is beautiful and I don't care and I think it was this realization that even vacations were something that had been passed on to me from someone earlier in my life that I was something that I should do that I must do this or else I will not gain their approval and I will get judgment from people that I care about but when I think about who do I care about who would care about whether or not I go on vacation there very very few and they certainly don't have the things that I want or have accomplished what I would like to accomplish and so why would I listen to them the big conclusion that I've had
(19:36) from this whole thing was maybe vacations aren't for me or maybe they're not for me right now and that's totally okay who made the rule that vacations must exist humans existed for a very long time before vacations were a thing and so the idea that this is a requirement for humans is very foreign and feels societally programmed also takes into the assumption that you have the money for the vacations it's basically a privileged thing that you then cast a projection onto somebody else saying they should exercise this privilege because that's what you would
(20:07) do in their position but maybe the reason you would do it in their position is why you're not in their position and so one of the other things that we did this year is that we traveled significantly less and so this year in total I think we took somewhere in the neighborhood 12 you know 10 to 12 days off in total and I would Define a day off as not working at all that would be a day off and so I would say workday I would Define as more than C four hours of work as a work day so maybe on the days off I would still consider I worked for a few hours but I'll count that as a day off so big picture The increased
(20:39) focus and decrease in change in variables in my environment allowed me to work more because I had fewer changing variables that I had to accommodate on a regular basis and so Lela and I were looking over our calendars yesterday we did a joint podcast going over each month of the year like what we focused on in that month and what was interesting is that we kept swiping through it it was just just like work work work just like an onslaught of things that we did over and over and over again and I can tell you this is that the periods where I've had tremendous Financial growth across
(21:10) different companies that I founded have almost always had these very long periods where I just have to do reps and this is like I'm in a rocky cut scene of my own right now and I know that it's likely going to take three-ish years and I'm probably about a year in and I probably have two more years to get to the other side and it's just that I've been on this roller coaster before and I know how the song goes it's less like weird for me and also I don't have the anxiety of will this be forever I know it's not going to be forever and I know that it's a season and even if it is
(21:44) forever I have found that it's far more productive for me to work seven days a week 8 to 10 hours a day than it is for me to work five and take two people have different preferences but for me it's kind of like the summer Gap in learning so when kids take 3 months off for the summer they have this whole summer catchup that they have to do which takes like another quarter for them to just get back to where they were and so if you think about the 3 months plus the katchup it's like kids are only like net positive for like 6 months of the year
(22:14) and the other 6 months they're not so they're basically learning at half speed from an entrepreneur perspective we're incentivized to get as much quality work done as possible and so for me I work very well on realistically a 10 to 12 hour a day schedule obviously there's probably two or 3 days a week that I'll work 16 to 18 but I would say my my true average is probably 7 days a week of 12 and i' would say weekends are shorter and I probably have two or three days like I said during the week that are probably 18s and so that gets me somewhere in the 90 hours a week range but for me that's actually fairly doable
(22:45) because my wife's here with me I have a gym downstairs I have all the people that I care about and I I care about them because they support me they take interest in my goals and they want to help me accomplish them they increase the likelihood that those goals occur and so what else could I ask from someone for my life like what I'm I'm very happy with my life and I think that a lot of people take offense to me being happy about my life because they think that I cast judgment on them living differently you can do whatever you want
(23:08) I make this channel because I've been trying to document this since I had nothing all the way to a billion dollars plus and just say what's worked for me my team asked me to clarify this because they're with me a 100 days straight means no weekends so I just worked the first 100 days of the year so that took me into whatever that is April so a lot of you hear 100 days and think oh my God my friends would throw a fit if I worked 100 days straight well if you want better friends then expect to see them less because better friends are busy friends better friends are doing things with their lives and I
(23:40) don't know about you but I would rather see someone less frequently who's actually pursuing great things than someone who's always available to see me all the time and has zero material updates because they are in no way growing or getting better because my biggest fear would that they rub off on me and the friends that I have now I can count on one hand and almost all of them are entrepreneur I say almost they're all entrepreneurs and they're all very high level entrepreneurs and we basically stay in touch via text and none of them live in the same state as
(24:07) me all of my friends treat text like email which is like we text and none of us have an expectation of response it's like oh I can't believe you didn't respond to my text for three days it is super normal for each of my friends to have not responded to me and for me not to respond to them for days at a time and none of us blow up and have a tantrum because we know the other person's busy and they'll get to it when they get to it so with on on the on the on the back end of that uh serious note fun things did happen this year and so I ended up
(24:39) buying aq.com three-letter domain from Yahoo and so they had owned that since 1998 or9 I can't remember it was 90 it was 96 through 98 so they had owned it for like 26 years something like that and I finally was able to wrestle it from there from their grip and so that was really cool for those of you curious it was $480,000 to buy the domain I don't buy a lot of crazy [ __ ] and um I'm allowed to spend my money however I want to spend it and I think aq.com is dope and so on the back end of that part of
(25:10) the reason I did that was because we just uh stood up acq Ventures so really proud of that it's primarily focused on uh SAS and Tech enabled Services the reason that we're doing it is basically because our family office which functions like a private Equity but it's a family office in that we don't have uh outside LPS or limited partners people who give us money so we don't have any people give us money it's all our money which is why it's a family office but in terms of the day-to-day most family offices tend to be passive we are very active in our investments and we take significantly larger positions and so we
(25:38) stood this up because we have a tremendous amount of people who who uh who are entrepreneurs we meet uh through the various things that we do that would like uh investment they would like help but they don't want to necessarily hand over control or hand over have that level of Engagement and so we we stood up acq Ventures because there's just honestly a ton of demand for a different capital structure uh for our investments we just did our first three Deals in acq Ventures I think should finalize in the next week or two so before the end of the year kind of cool and so that will
(26:07) be a much higher volume deal side for acquisition. comom and that Branch will just be on the Venture side well speaking of big things that I did this year I worked a crazy amount on the $100 million scaling road map and it's yours for free and I'll tell you how to get it right now I did it across all eight departments so the departments were sales marketing customer service product it HR recruiting and finance and so what problem exists at every level and I broke it into 10 stages and what you need to do to graduate from that level
(26:37) so you can literally just look at your own business and see what things you're missing what things you're lagging on maybe sometimes what things you're ahead on because it's very neat to put these things into 10 stages but reality is messy and so it's more that you'll be at stage five you'll have some things that you're at stage seven on and some things that you're at stage three on but those stage three things will likely be things that you will need to fix sooner than the things that you're at stage seven on
(26:59) right and so it's very much the constraints concept where you have a weak link and this helps you see where you're the furthest behind so you can kind of uplevel those things faster and so I just dropped the training it's at acquisition. comom trining and so if you want to write down the link this is it it's acquisition.
(27:19) comom trining and just click the $100 million scaling roadmap and you can go there we also have a little button there that you can get a personalized plan made for you so you just answer some questions and we'll tell you what stage uh you are at and we'll give you the one before and the one after so you know what you should be finished and what you have a line of sight to uh it's absolutely free uh you can just go there and uh enjoy it's 14 hours you don't need to watch the whole thing just watch the section that's that's specific to your business right
(27:42) now so big thing right now is growth Trends so I think this might be one of the most valuable sections uh of this video for you guys and historically when I would do my podcast recap of the year was always my most popular episode and so now I'm just doing it on YouTube but these were the things that I would say we learned or that we doubled down on in the portfolio that yielded really good results so number one is we focused a lot on leadership Talent recruiting all right so you call this key player recruiting um and the big thing here is that I kind of switched my perspective
(28:15) on this which is fundamentally if you listen to Steve Jobs you listen to Bezos you listen to Zuckerberg a lot of them take a a hugely active role in bringing in top talent and so my understanding of talent has been probably the single largest shift that I've had this year in terms of my understanding of business and why I think that we're disproportionately growing across the portfolio the companies that are doing the best are the ones that we've been able to to place key players and part of that is being willing as the CEO as the founder to actively show interest in
(28:45) these types of people and they are the type of people that would not respond to traditional recruiter because they are either so good at what they do and they want to know that their investment in the compan is going to be valuable these are not the type of people who feel you're giving them an opportunity to work for you these are the types of people that they are giving you the opportunity of helping build your business bringing their entire Rolodex of people they already know teams that sometimes they can they can bring with them and just a huge stack of skills
(29:14) that ideally should disproportionately benefit the business and fundamentally this is one of the highest leverage things that you can do because at the most basic level what you need to do as a CEO is attract the absolute best people and align incentives ruthlessly for them to work and then get out of their way and so that was probably the the one of the biggest ones number two was was Focus all right now I talk about focus a lot so I'm I'm going to try and say this in a different way than I normally do it's really top down focus and prioritization which is just another
(29:46) word for strategy but just how much more important strategy is for businesses because what happens is when they pursue too many paths they get they look up a year later and they haven't grown much at all and if if you're a small business like you absolutely can double triple quadruple 5x every year for a few years before sometimes that'll slow down now if you have a compounding mechanism it could even keep going and getting faster at the very least like growing at 10% a year again there's nothing wrong with that but if you're at a million bucks a year or five million bucks a year even $10 million a year like you should be
(30:16) able to grow a lot faster than that and typically it's because you lack people and because you lack focus and when I say people it means you lack good enough people the people you have you might have a a high headcount but a low Talent account and focus you might have lots of priorities but they're the wrong ones and so fundamentally if you can't focus on one thing one objective that is most important that makes the rest of your objectives less important then you are not doing your job as the CEO to tell
(30:45) the team how they should be allocating their attention and that and here's the important part is deleting everything that is not this and so a lot of people are like these are our objectives also keep doing everything else it's like you can't do that you can't just add more because now you you've even further diluted what's important now for sure people need to continue transact sales guys still need to sell customer service still needs to service but the discretionary effort that exists in the top talent the leaders of the company who aren't as
(31:13) involved in the day-to-day and are basically all times they have between aligning teams should be dedicated to a single priority that if accomplished would be an order of magnitude Improvement in the business and so this level of focus is what I continue to drill with the founders and the CEOs of the portfolio companies and it has yielded outsize returns and there's a great razor for this which is when I want to fix a system or when I go into a department the first thing I do is eliminate as much as humanly possible and here's the thing is people are
(31:44) afraid of eliminating meetings eliminating communication lines eliminating processes but if you eliminate just about everything you'll find out that the vast majority of that stuff was complete waste and complete distraction and here's the cool thing you can always add it back so there's this sphere of loss people literally have fear of loss around processes and meetings which is ridiculous but that's just how we're wired psychologically which is why companies in general as they grow create bloat there's too many
(32:09) people doing too many things that don't matter or not enough stuff to begin with and all of them together don't know how what they do makes the company money and so one of the easiest tasks that you can do is zoom all the way out and think what is the output of this department what is the output of Finance have you ever thought about like what is the output of Finance the output of Finance is information to make decisions that's it and so if you're getting too much information or you're getting the wrong information or the information that you're getting doesn't change your decisions then the function of Finance
(32:41) is inadequate you're not getting enough of what you need of output from that department if the function of it is to gather store display and analyze information then are you getting the correct data are you able to analyze it are you able to display it and see in real time um and be able to make decisions off it also another information output Department kind of interesting right so many of these departments really exist just to have information to make decisions and so I bring this up because you have to delete until you have the fewest things that
(33:11) matter it's like you want to cut to the Bone you don't want to cut to fat or cup muscle you want to go all the way to the Bone and then add the few things that matter most back in and I think that I'm doing this better now because honestly I think I'm just more ruthless and I think I care less about judgments of other people I think I'm honestly I think it's just like I'm more confident what I'm doing now and so it's like I think I conceptually felt the same way I just was like this feels crazy even though it makes sense to me and so fundamentally first principles thinking operates from
(33:40) this perspective of like okay physics are laws that we have to obey what else do we have to obey the law of the land so we've got government laws that we have to obey besides that tell me a physical law or government law that prevents us from doing this thing in one tenth of the time tell me the law if not then there is a way and here's the thing is that there will simply be resources that are required and so one of the things that I'm trying to get my team to understand is if I ask to do something
(34:05) and they say we can't do it that's saying it's impossible and it's ridiculous and of course they're wrong so it's a terrible position to take it's also very frustrating instead tell me what it would take tell me the resources that would be required that we'd have to take from something else and then we together can decide whether it's worth the trade so for example if my whole media team I said hey I want to make AEM motion picture for example right I'm not saying I want to do that let's say that we decided that was a big a big strategic party if we were to get one
(34:34) big motion picture that was as big as Avatar uh then it would be you know maybe it would do things for the business okay then they might say well we can't do that now implicit in that statement is we can't do that and keep making content at the at the level that we're at so then we'd say okay well if we allocated all the resources and stop making content and we actually were able to get a featurelength film with the existing media team would the benefit of that be worth the the cost and if it is then great we'll do it but a lot of times we get a we get a soft no immediately out the gate rather than a
(35:06) what it would take and this has been one of the biggest shifts that I think has empowered me is asking better questions and so one of the most frequently asked questions that I will probably my question of the year is what would it take and by doing this the reason I think it's such a powerful question it also works for deals it works for sales it works for anything is that it assumes the result occurs it assumes success and so because it assumes success you work backwards from the reality that you want to create rather than forwards trying to figure it out as you go I'll tell you
(35:36) something funny so we had a company that we were looking at and um in the diligence process I said hey you've got this downsell basically no one takes it have you considered just giving it away for free to get more leads and they ended up doing it and they tripled their lead flow the next week and so that downsell was worth maybe 5% of Revenue but what's the value of tripling lead flow tripling revenue and probably disproportionately dropping to the bottom line so tripling really would triple lead flow so it would cut CAC by 2/3 but fundamentally it would it
(36:07) would triple the business and so there are so many of these little things that exist inside of companies and just being focused enough to say no this is our core product this is where we make all of our money anything that's not that distracts us from making this thing better so theme number three was cro and so I'd say this year the companies that made the biggest gains uh had a discipline around conversion rate optimization and so that means that at any given point they're running three to 10 different split tests on the key parts of the pipeline for Revenue
(36:42) generation meaning if you have a landing page where you get a lot of traffic or you have a homepage that you get a lot of traffic or you have a follow-up sequence that a huge percentage of your customers are in actually testing things out there so one of the companies we had had three cro improvements and this was the largest company we have in the portfolio so we got A plus 20% cro test Improvement which is a mass a monster win especially at the level of optimization that this company's in so we're talking eight figures plus a month
(37:08) in Revenue like it's a big company and So 20% lift is huge but on top of that we got a 50% lift and then we got a 28% lift so we had three Mega wins now the question is how many split tests did we have to do for that I mean probably 100 but the thing is is that that was basically one guy and a couple devs split basically running these sprints on a regular basis but how valuable is that to the company tremendously valuable because things that are efficiency uh improvements typically are long lasting what's cool about that is that when you have an efficiency Improvement it means your LTV to CAC ratio expands which
(37:44) allows you to spend more money in advertising more money in Talent acquisition all the way around the business it literally just makes the business stronger and is a competitive mode and so I'll give you a little hack that is worth looking at which is many businesses integrate thirdparty tools into your processes right you've got a 100 different softwares that you probably pay for what none of those softwares typically advertise is what their conversion rate is and so if anything is customer facing that a prospect might interact with I would
(38:14) look at three or four other tools within the exact same use case and see which one has a higher conversion rate on the ux so the user experience I think you will get disproportionate Returns on that it's typically a heavier lift because splitting between multiple tools is a pain in the ass but I've seen monster lifts there so those are the three probably biggest themes which was people focus and then optimization around the things that worked really well across the portfolio uh in 2025 now the next part is okay well what are the detractors right these are the things that grew those businesses but what are some of the things that hurt those
(38:51) businesses and so I actually see this as the personal stuff all right so we had a few entrepreneurs that I think took their foot off the gas they started making more money than they'v been accustomed to and we like this is good enough and so this is where having you know some people call it a big reason why you can have whatever you want as long as you change your behavior I don't really care what it's a big reason why or you just change but either way you have to find something that's going to keep driving you so for me it's the Love
(39:16) of the Game I just enjoy business and so I spend all my time doing business some people don't enjoy business as much and so it either has to be some mission that you have around the problem that you solve like it actually has to light you up otherwise you will make enough money and you'll stop pushing then now again if you accomplish your goals that's amazing that's great again I make my channel for people who just want to consistently grow consistently grow in personal development and using money is just a stick for seeing how how far how
(39:40) far You' you've stacked your skills right also not saying that money is a a is a virtue or having money is a virtue just saying that in general you step you become more skilled and you can measure how skilled you are in the game of Business by the amount of money you make now here's one that's going to be uncomfortable for a lot of people is spouses indoor partners and so one of the big detractors believe it or not and I've seen this and this is a big Focus that Laya and I have across the team is how much support do the key players on your team and or the entrepreneurs have
(40:13) from their spouses and so you basically have the worst type of spouse which is a spouse who actively decreases the likel to your goals so they are constantly reminding you of the negatives that exist they're trying to constantly distract you say hey stop working stop talking about that let's do this instead so not only do they try to get you to stop working they try incentivize You by doing something else and so it's reversing a negative and a positive it's like a double whimmy and the thing is is that I want to be clear I don't think there's malicious intention here but the result of what they do still massively
(40:42) damages the business like if you were to think of an enemy what would an enemy do they would try and get you to not think about the business and then do something else that you get addicted to instead it's almost like going to the to your competitor and be like try some heroin I think you might like it what occurs is more or less the same and again I'm not talking about intention here I'm just talking about what happens and so when we looked back so we did like a retroactive analysis of this of like who were the stars who just crushed and kept
(41:07) growing they were the ones who had absolute spouse support who were like if they need to work late they need to work the weekends I'll pack them with a lunch I'm you know I'm here at home and this happened for husbands and wives both sides the ones who where you had somebody who came in who presented like a star but then eventually fizzled was typically because and this is where it's so nefarious is that they would get into a relationship ship at some point or they they would upgrade the relationship
(41:30) like they'd move in together right something like that and that person would have a disproportionate effect on the entrepreneur and so what's really interesting is that entrepreneurs are typically we're so concerned with our surroundings who we want in our space who's who's good who's helping us out and then for some reason the person who has a 71 correlation with your subjective well-being the person who will probably have the largest influence on your behavior in your life you don't hold to the same standard and I find
(41:55) that crazy but it happens all the time and just just because everyone else does it doesn't mean that it makes sense it's also why most people are mediocre I think that one is that if you're looking to bring a highle person onto the team I would consider talking to their spouse just make just gauge their interest level see if they're supportive like in the middle they're neutral but I think neutral becomes negative over time so you need someone who's active who's who's who when when the employee inevitably has a bad day because
(42:19) everyone does they say hey this is a great job this is great for us as a family like you got this I trust you I believe in you I support you what can I do to help tell me how I can make this easier for you that is the type of support you want whereas if you have somebody who says let's leave work outside it's home now and I I don't want to hear about that let's do all this other stuff instead that sounds innocent the problem is that it decreases the likelihood they win and again I know this will be controversial so you know take it or leave it again my two cense
(42:50) you can tell me to shove it it's up to you let's talk about the next big one so uh in creating that scaling road map that I was talking about earlier I wanted to create like a micro cycle that I felt had to exist within every process right and so I'm going to break down two different processes that are different one is scaling the other is optimization all right so I'm going to walk through both so whenever you have a system you'll typically start as the first step so whatever you're doing you want to start out you have to start Number One S then you have C which is compound all
(43:21) right so you have to do more okay great we're doing more the next is augment so so how do we do better then we have leverage which is how do we make it consistent right how do we automate it and so I'll just I'll I'll make this a little infinite thing and then finally how do we expand again and so this is actually a loop between each of these steps so you start and then you do more and then once you do more you try to get better once you get better and you know what works you try and automate it and make it
(43:55) consistent and have low volatility and then you expand to the next territory you expand to the next Channel you expand to the next type of content you expand to the next product the same process and it's nice because it has this little uh it's got this nice acronym s c a l e and so it actually fit in there um I was super pumped about that and so now when I think about what someone has to do next within an apartment I have think okay where are they at okay they just started this thing so they just need to do more oh they've done a lot okay so maybe there's probably a lot of wayte so now we
(44:25) probably should do better how can we augment how can we streamline how can we optimize once they're doing better it's like okay they're doing really well but there's more demand that's coming in how can we make this consistent how can we automate this or portions of this work and then finally once we have this thing airtight we're like cool how can we do this again and we expand if we're thinking about this within the context of content it's like we start posting on a channel then we say okay well one post a day works can we do three posts a day so we do more then we're like hey some
(44:49) of these posts do better than others how can we make our post better and then we say cool what percentage of these processes can we use AI for what things can we pre-prep we can B basically make better happen more easily and more consistently how can we make it instead of having you know one do 10K views and one have a million views how can we get all of them over 100k how can we get all of them over 250k and then finally we're like okay I think we've maxed out this specific Channel how do we now go to Tik Tok how do we take this process and go
(45:14) to Snapchat or whatever so it works for anything now the second process so that's about scaling this is about optimization and so this is typically when you come in and fix something that already exists and so I got to have a lot of experience with this this year because I took over media and conversion within acquisition.
(45:32) comom and I haven't operated day-to-day probably in like 5 years and so it was actually a ton of fun for me because honestly it's just like I've I've developed a lot of skills since the last time I operated and uh it's been great so anyways the first thing is you question the requirements and I got this framework from Elon and it's freaking awesome so question the requirements why are we doing everything that we're doing please explain to me how does this thing relate to this output and this is why defining what each Department is supposed to create is so valuable you're the content team the goal here is to make as much good
(45:59) content as humanely possible anything that does not facilitate content Creation in terms of volume and quality is waste if you're an engineering team it's like you have code that you must type which then creates software that people can use and we want the quality of that software to be really high and so anything that does not relate to those things are things that are waste so we question why we do everything the second once you kind of get lay of the land after questioning is you delete and you delete because the next few steps are going to be adding resources to the
(46:24) system and so you delete everything that doesn't matter so the first step that I did when I took over the media team was I deleted all meetings now to be clear it doesn't mean that we're never going to have meetings again it just means that I will find out which meetings matter and then we will add those in proportionally and so I said you can have ad hoc discussions about clear things but otherwise I'm canceling the recurring meetings and I replaced all team meetings all one-on ones with just a daily huddle that way basically the
(46:46) entire day and these were also deep workers so everyone who's creating content really just wants to get into flow and anything that prevents flow massively impacts their performance and so it's like the solution of just adding more people and adding more meetings just gets more people to not work it's terrible and most people also hate it most people want to work and so once you delete then you optimize which is saying okay what of the things that we're doing right now get us the most results what is what are these things that get us the
(47:14) least results what are the resourcers required to do them as in like time spent or money spent in order to get it and then we optimize it so we say the things that give us the most for the least we put as the first priority the next thing that gets us you know the most for the most we put as the second priority the things that get us a very little amount that cost a lot we put at the end and we're just basically going to not do those things and so you reoptimize the actual processes once you've deleted everything else then you
(47:37) pull up timelines you say how can we make this happen faster how can we do this in one/ tenth a time and what's crazy is that you honestly can increase the speed of things by 5x 10x it happens it really it's it's mindblowing when you do it CU you're like I can't believe how much waste we've had this whole time all you do is when you ask questions you say how many hours do does that take and so then someone's going to respond with how many hours it take so rather than this is the classic instead of doing end of
(48:03) week deadlines you just make it end of day and so if a team is used to delivering something to a team meeting every Monday and you say cool how many hours does that take great let's have it done by the end of the day you 7x the speed of that team 7x and so some people can't comprehend how one company can grow at so much faster rate than others and it's because of this resource allocation they pull up time good drivers make things happen faster because companies's like if you accomplish a goal in 100 years who cares time is a huge function in business if
(48:32) you don't have a process around pulling up timelines consistently and here's why it's so important because if you have time today like let's say there's more utilization on the team like you can they have bandwidth and you pull stuff up and they're like hey we don't need that for another week like why are you why are you making me do it by the end of today because we don't know what's going to happen next week and we might have a priority next week that we do need to get end of day and then when that happens we still won't have done this other thing and now we have to do
(48:55) the other one so this other thing's now two weeks and so basically you want to use up all available resources that are renewable on a consistent basis to get the highest return so I want to make sure like you understand the argument there because you're going to have to tell it to your team the reason I'm going to drive this outcome even though there's no apparent outside urgency is because it assumes that the future is going to be exactly like today and one of the things I can guarantee is that the future won't be and that there will be things that you
(49:23) didn't expect and when that day comes you will want to have all of the things that you've accomplished behind you supporting you and have as many resources as seemly possible available to you to deploy in that moment because the most adaptable player in the system survives that is what survival of the fittest means within the context of business it's the most adaptable player the most flexible and so the final step here is automate same as before and so this is what you look at when you're trying to fix something or turn something around or make it better all right this is when you're trying to scale something I I could probably come
(49:55) up with something cute around optimized but I many letters all right and so hopefully those two Frameworks give you two different ways to look at departments when you come in you're like okay is this a scale thing so we need to do more we need to do better we need to make it reliable or automated portion of it or do we need to expand or is this everything screwed up why are we doing what we're doing okay delete all that stuff optimize the things that get us the most outcome pull up time requirements then automate having these types of Frameworks to solve problems
(50:19) makes life so much easier which is why I share it with you so the next one is about success and failure and knowing why so Professor bergerman from Stanford has this this uh statement where he says it's better to fail and know why you failed than to succeed and not now notwithstanding the outcome itself but he's talking about you as an individual it's better to know why you want why you lost than not know why you won because you can't learn anything from it essentially it means that the success was purely chance right which means you can't repeat it and so Edison you know
(50:43) had 10,000 ways not to know how to make a light bulb right it's same kind of idea and like if as long as you learn from your failures on a long enough time Horizon and you don't give up you will win period And so an expert you can Define as somebody who's made all the mistakes that you can possibly make in a very narrow field and so fundamentally that's what we want want to be within our businesses and So within that context I have now spoken to a lot of business owners because we started this Workshop division so we could meet more
(51:05) businesses so we could do acq Ventures and obviously within the main portfolio and that you're noticing I'm lining up a lot of sheets here so there are what I call the six Horsemen of of business stagnation and so if you are stuck this is for you so there are six reasons that I've seen that have been continuous rock and hard plac scenars and the reason that business owners get stuck here is because you have to choose between two apparently impossible choices one is pain today the other is pain forever and
(51:33) both of them sting and that's why people just Wade water in pain because hurts a little bit less to keep pain forever than have a lot of short-term pain now so these are the big six so number one is being underpriced this is how it presents a business owner is at close to full capacity so like let's say they they provide some services and they're like I can't I can't work any more than I already have or my team can't work anymore than it already is and and and this is the key point and we're not making money so when that occurs they want to look at all these different things but the problem is you're just
(52:05) mispriced now there's the fear that if I raise my price I will lose my customers and then it will get worse right but the thing is is that I have I have I have shephered so many businesses through price raises that it makes me sick and the process of raising price works like this you get to the price and then you say a higher number and you keep going up until people stop buying that is how you do it in the back of knacken redneck logic way that I prefer most times if you're in that situation you get to pick do you want to have a few people say no and you make more money or do you want
(52:42) to be barely above water and not be able to expand forever because the reason you can't expand the business is because you don't have cash flow you don't have cash flow because your prices are wrong and so we need to fix the price once we fix the price we'll free up cash with the freed up cash we can expand a new location we can hire that key person that you need to bring in number one if you are full capacity and you aren't making money you need to raise your price an easy way to do it is every five plus 20 all right so I actually got this from
(53:11) lifting weights it's the reverse of this which is once you increase volume by 20% bump your intensity up by five meaning add five pounds right or 5% right so bump volume by 20 bump intensity by five and then volume will drop again but now you have higher intensity and so it's this kind of B balanced progression process it's just a very simple one but it actually works the same way for price and so it's like you sell five customers if they all say yes to that price or around the same percentage or you net more money overall you bump the price by 20% and do it again and you just keep
(53:41) doing the five five and 20 keep doing 5 and 20 until eventually not enough people are saying yes that you're netting less money now the problem is if you have small sales numbers it's harder to hear no more often because your brain isn't going to calculate the fact that you made 20% more it's going to be binary in its thinking of like it was a yes or a no and the thing is is that if you sell three people at twice the price it's better than selling five people at half the price but you're going to hear no more often and so it's going to hurt more but it is better for the business for two reasons one you actually make
(54:13) more money secondly and this is the big one people forget you also have fewer people to service so you have less cost and more Revenue which those two things together create a disproportionate increase in profit big thing number one fix your price so the second big problem is overcompensation now what I mean by this is actually paying people not like you're overcompensating for stuff okay this typically happens when you have uh a set of employees especially in service businesses where you accidentally in the beginning give some sort of Revenue
(54:43) share or something like that so it doesn't matter you can't out earn it right like if you grow the business they just grow their revenue like you you you overcompensate them or you mcomp them and maybe you did that in the beginning because the revenue was really low and you never thought you get to where you're at now and then your big fear right each one of these has a rock and hard play scenario the big fear is if I tell them that they're going that I have to change the compensation they're going to leave and the answer is maybe but if
(55:07) you don't you'll never grow so what are you going to do right you have to over you have to go through the short-term pain to get the long-term gain and so the process that I'd recommend doing number one is you Shore up the infrastructure which means that you bring someone else in that can do the same thing as that person and do it at the new price that you want to pay them for then you can have the conversation with them with more leverage and saying hey the market is this I'm paying you this I understand this is what I need to
(55:32) pay you in order for us to accomplish our goals which is what I sold you on is that we want to accomplish this big Vision with the business now I understand that isn't like I'm changing expectations and so go home talk to your wife sleep on it and come back tomorrow if you want to stay here for that compensation I'll give you a delay so this is the key part is you say hey I'll keep paying you this for the next 2 months or 3 months whatever and after that then you'll go to this new kind of comp compens ation philosophy now if they come back and say no I feel underappreciated blah blah blah then
(56:01) that's fine and the good news is you already have somebody who's right there ready to go that's the second big issue the third big problem and this is a big one is this is really common when you're smaller so I'd say sub three million this is you guys all right serve too many I'll just say infinite avatars all right meaning you serve too many customers and what happens is all these different people have different demands and so they are telling you all these different things and you can't get your offer right you can't get your advertising right because you're serving too many people now again what's the Rock and hardplay scenario well if I get
(56:34) narrower on my avatar I'm going to sell fewer customers and I'm getting all these other people well to me number one is if you fix your messaging you will attract more of the right people but you haven't been willing to take that bet the alternative is you can try and be every everything to everyone which you know isn't going to work because it's what you're already doing and you know it's not working and so you have the evidence that your your existing path is going to stagnate you and so again Again
(56:56) The Impossible choice is do you want to keep stagnating forever and maybe you make some money now but it's preventing you from growing or are you willing to and the business is about risk like you have to be comfortable with risk like this is going to all of these are risks but the alternative is you never risk and you stay exactly where you are and so for me that is a much greater risk it's like when you get into investing anything you invest money into can go down so you incur that risk but if you never invest you absolutely will never get wealthy so what are you going to do
(57:22) right you have to take the small risk so that you avoid the much larger long-term risk and each of these is small short-term risk to avoid large long-term risk so here you have to Niche down who you're serving which you do by 8020 so that means you look at all of your customers and you say what are the top 20% who are these people what do they do where are they from and you say how do I make this my message and how do I make an offer that's only for them that they would go nuts for and here's the part people miss and price it accordingly so
(57:55) if you have customer that you provide five times the value to and I'm sure you do have those people well all of a sudden if you were to turn some of these bad ones away then your price could reflect the value that you serve to only that much narrower Avatar and that's okay and that's great so you may yet again and by the way this is the point make more money all of these are counterintuitive which is why people get stuck the next one the next Rock and hardplay scenarios is overextension all right so this one is you know Alex's Alex's favorite this is Alex's greatest
(58:29) hits of mistakes is me trying to take on too many things I have a plate that's this big and I try and I start putting food on the table because I can't fit it on the plate and typically this is where you get ahead of your skis where you open that second location when the first location isn't really operating as much as well as you think it is and as soon as you go there the revenue from the first one drops and you're like uhoh but a lot of that was my profit and so now you've got these fixed costs the revenue's down and then you've got this one but this one's new so it's not doing as well as the first one was was and
(58:57) your star person's there but you're not there and so now you're splitting between two locations and you're like oh man now I'm actually making the same amount as I was with one but now I have two twice the risk and you're like oh you know what the solution should be I'll open a third and then between the three now your profit goes down even more and now you're not making any money but you have three locations and you have TR three times the risk and you're stressed out of your mind so what do you do honestly you have two solutions you either have to hire incredibly
(59:20) impressive people which means that you're going to probably give up your income in order to bring this person on or you have to your losses you have to prune the tree you have to reconcentrate get it right and then scale back out again the right way and so overextension is typically a who problem which is you don't have enough good people that you left behind who can actually run it without you and so this happens a lot of times in like the1 to3 million range it happens at all ranges but a lot there because when you get there you typically
(59:49) suck yourself out of the day today you're not you're not you're not actually selling people you're not doing customer service and you're not doing delivery but the issue is you think that because you're not involved in the acquisition and delivery that you're not required to run the business but the thing is is that you work every hour of the day right now and so if you work every hour of the day but you're not selling and you're not delivering then it means you're doing other stuff and that other stuff you're doing is very much operating the business and so a lot of owners will mistakenly think that CEO
(1:00:19) and owner mean the same thing you happen to be both but they are not the same and so right now is you leave so it's like the CEO leaves the business and all of a sudden the business stops running as well because the CEO is gone so you have to have somebody who's going to operate behind you you have to basically backfill yourself and in my opinion I like a six-month test at the very least do a one-month test which is go away for a month and you hand your phone you show your phone to your operator and you say hey here's the deal you're going to get this override on the business so a
(1:00:48) little profit share whatever or some stock and in doing that I'm doing this in exchange for this not ringing that's the deal and if this rings then that's not the deal and so it's like then you roll play it out so it's like let's say a pipe burst what do you do if it's call you wrong answer CU what do you think I'm going to do I'm going to call a plumber so what are you going to do just call the plumber directly you don't need to call me to call the plumber same idea if it's an emergency call 911 if it's
(1:01:11) not an emergency don't call me either way don't call me and so this is the trade so if you're overextended you either got to dip into your own paycheck to bring someone in or you got to prune the tree reconcentrate and then build it back right and the six-month test I was alluding to is the business has to either maintain or grow for six straight months without your direct involvement now that last point is the big one without your direct involvement now some of you are going to run that test still continue to work in the day-to-day for six months and then say oh I think I did it but you just didn't change what you
(1:01:42) did at all and the business continue to operate with you as CEO which is not the case so you just delay six months and then you open the next location well which should still make you a little bit better in terms of your cash position but not my recommendation so what's what's what's number five so number five is more than one business so this is also an Alex special I have a lot of specials here four and five are are my my personal favorites uh that I've made the most often which is you've got two businesses or you've got three businesses because you don't know how to
(1:02:09) pick and you operate from the fallacy that Zucker bird had a side hustle Zuckerberg was also flipping airbnbs and doing wholesaling on the side right and that's how you build Facebook of course not one of these businesses is the business you should be doing and the thing is is that the opportunity is the problems that you need to solve and aren't it's not in the missed opportunities it's the problems that need to be solved right it's the hairy work that you're not sure what the answer is but you know you need to fix it that is where the opportunity is
(1:02:34) because fundamentally If the product were exceptional and everybody loved it you wouldn't have an issue you'd be going all in on that business and so if that's the case then just do it now you're going to have this sunk cost valy of like I already put all this money into this and I already already got it going I already have a partner there yes short-term risk you lose relationship you lose maybe short-term income from that from that business long-term risk you never grow any of these things to any material size because you're too distracted pick again do whatever you
(1:03:00) want but I'm just saying these are these are the most common ones and then finally we've got no data Daddy all right no data Papa so with no data daddy the issue is you don't even know what your problem is because you don't collect any data and so it'd be like hey what you know what do we need to grow what's our lead cost no idea what's our close rate no idea what's our what's our what's our turn no idea well you can't really do much if you have no idea what's going on on and so this then becomes the constraint of the business which is we need to start collecting
(1:03:30) data now to be clear the first five have what I consider an impossible scenario there's some some cost the cost here is that you give up a business the cost here is that you have to cut you have to prune things or you have to hire someone and hurt your own income here the issu is that you have to say no to customers that you're currently making money from here the issue is that you have to say no to employees you're currently overcompensating here you have to turn down customers at a lower price and have
(1:03:54) and hear no more often those are the short-term cost but the one big risk of all is that is that your business isn't going to grow and you've been stuck for long enough to know it's already not happening and there's not going to be a silver bullet you got to confront this the no data daty issue is just hey silly pants get your data then you'll actually be able to grow now there's no downside to this one the only downside here is that you've got some shiny object that you think is really really sexy and interesting and you don't get to do that because you need to do this so do this
(1:04:19) first and I'll give you a really useful razor for how to think about what data to collect to collect all right so the easiest test for is this data valuable is when it changes so that's a Delta so if it goes up or it goes down does it change that's another Delta Behavior so if we track our views on a social media channel if the views go up does it change what we do if the views go down does it change what we do if the answer is no then we don't need to track it because you can track unlimited variables in the world like you can track the temperature of the room when when people are walking in you could
(1:04:56) track it but will it change your behavior you can also reverse engineer into what are the behaviors we do what data affects it and those are the only pieces of data that you need to track so my biggest personal growth lesson of the year so I give you all the portfolio growth things but my number one was Rush is imaginary now I just gave you that whole speech on urgency but one of the things that is that I've had to learn is my biggest mistakes have been sh object or woman in the red dress and overextension and so I have these arbitrary goals that I set for myself that I never say out loud that I think
(1:05:34) about every day that mean nothing to no one and then I try and force everything to happen on this arbitrary timeline that I made up and then I'm upset when people who don't know my arbitrary timeline fall short of the speed that I wanted to happen even though I made it up to begin with and so Leila gave me this Frame that I alluded to briefly earlier but it's probably been I would say Talent focus and this is a subset of focus but it's missed opportunities is less than problems so what I mean by that is that the opportunities that you're looking for are in the problems that you need to
(1:06:12) solve and me understanding this i' I've repeated it because it's it's really been singed into my brain there are for example if you're starting to get low reviews these are things that threaten the livelihood of the business that is a problem if you're not doing email follow follow up that is a missed opportunity and unless your call it payback rate or your LTV or some sort of conversion mechanism is the risk of the business then that would be a missed opportunity if if the if the number one risk in the
(1:06:37) business right now is that like you can't make money because you aren't converting a higher percentage of leads then that would shift into a problem it's not that like any specific thing is one or the other it's recognizing contextually within your business is this something that would be nice to do or is this something that we must do in order for us to achieve our ultimate goal we might be able to achieve our ultimate goal without doing email followup if our product sucks we will never achieve our ultimate goal and so it's understanding the order of magnitude or the importance of the
(1:07:08) potential tasks that you have the reason that this stressed me out for so long and this is the big one is that problems in your business are actually finite you can list all the number of problems in your business by and large missed opportunities are infinite I would look at the world of all the things that we could do and here's the thing is the better you get at business the more things you know you should be doing that you aren't and you see this huge unlimited potential options of things and you look at these tiny little resources that you have and then it's like we need to do all of these things
(1:07:37) and this is where you stress out your team and you stress out yourself for literally no reason it's been difficult for me and it's been a discipline now to ask myself first when I want something to happen is this a missed opportunity or is this a problem and nine times out a 10 it's a missed opportunity and so I've been doubling down on problems and solving those the thing is is that problems are typically not nearly as fun as missed opportunities because missed opportunities have all the new gloss on them they're they're they're still in the wrapping paper you're like oh my God
(1:08:05) this is going to be amazing but as soon as you get into it you're like ah there's problems here too and then and I've said this before but what ends up happening is when you have this Miss opportunity bug you you start building all of these half-built Bridges right you never actually get all the way across you've got a dollar here but you're standing on this side of the land right and you need to get this dollar across and you start building and then and then you find out that there's problems and then you're like oh no so you know what I'm going to do I'm going to build a second bridge and then you
(1:08:31) find out that there's problems and you're like oh no I hate problems I'm going to go find another one that doesn't have problems that immediately just makes me more money but there's always problems there's always problems and so it's like I have to just use the problems and I've got to stitch this thing together so that I can get the dollar all the way across and then into my very large pocket and so here's the difficult part of this for an entrepreneur is that when you whatever when you quit your job when you started this business you were very reinforced
(1:08:56) for pursuing a missed opportunity you weren't doing this thing you start this business and you get rewarded for doing it and the problem is is that you need to unlearn that behavior because it's a behavior that you only want to do once when you start your business and then every time after that you have to confront you have to endure you have to stick through the problem and see it to its natural end you have to get it all the way there so the dollars can make it across the bridge or you'll just have spent all the resources all the distraction to build and reinforce this
(1:09:25) thing that actually results in nothing and so this has been probably my my single biggest tier of lesson because this is a subset of focus for me specifically but I ask is this a missed opportunity or is this a problem and if it's a problem then I need to solve it and I just need to confront and a lot of the problems are things that you don't know how to solve yet that's why they're still unsolved and so you have to become comfortable in enduring the the failure of working with limited information or incomplete information because the
(1:09:56) reality of businesses is that you will almost always not have enough information to know perfectly whether this is the right call and so you have to be comfortable in ambiguity you have to be comfortable with incomplete data sets and still making the call because when you have a complete data set there's really no stress the answer is obvious because you have the data it's all the times where you're like oh well I wish I had tracked that one thing that I didn't know is going to be important now and I can't go back 6 months to get it that happens all the time and you just got to be able to make the call
(1:10:25) because the thing is is that we have this fear that we're leaving money on the table right we feel like this missed opportunity right here we're like man there's so much money on the table but the real money on the table sits in the problems that you know you should be solving but aren't and so once I realize that the problems are the things that I need to be solving then I can deploy all of the resources that I normally would use to distract myself to reinforce this bridge and reinforce this bridge and reinforce
(1:10:55) this bridge before I've made a dollar go across and then point all of those resources to one this big dollar sign so I can go put it into my pocket and actually solve it and so the compounding that occurs in business happens from Focus it's from doing one or two things exceptionally well not doing many things mediocre and missed opportunities are the gateway drug to mediocrity and how I how I deal with this emotionally is I have a big list of Alex's big money ideas and I've done this at very different times in my life life like when I know what we need to do and we just have to keep doing more of it and
(1:11:29) the thing is is like you probably know this too and yet you have this this this need for novelty right I get it believe me and so what I do is I add this idea to my big money list and then when we do have bandwidth I say what one big thing on this big money list are we going to attack what's crazy is I I'm like I've got a h 100 ideas on this list and then it's a fun problem for you to be like okay which of these things is the biggest thing that will get us the furthest and what's crazy is and if you actually do this I have found so many
(1:12:00) times that I'm in love with an idea and then a month later two months later I look at that idea on the list and I'm like I can't even believe I was so into that right and the thing is is that if you don't have that discipline you don't just write on it you don't let it you don't let it let it marinate for a little bit sometimes you end up deploying all these resources into something that you a month or two later would be like I don't even know why I did that and if you're if this is resonating with you right now then do
(1:12:21) more of this put more of the ideas on a big idea list and then just let it cook and don't tell anybody cuz you have this need to share you have this need to talk the idea out loud I get it I do it just write out as much as you need to there and then it's like you get you get it out of your head so you didn't have to you got all the details and all the craziness out and you're like I can shove it I'll deal with it later it's kind of like Abraham Lincoln he used to write these letters when he's really angry at people he'd write these huge letters just scathing letters to these
(1:12:45) people and then he would seal them and then he'd put them in his desk and he said he'd sleep on it and the next day if he wanted to send it he could and so his desk after years was just filled with all these letters that he never sent but it allowed him to get through the moment so I want to hit on this Rush piece CU I think this is important all right so I'm I'm going to put these over here to the side for a moment and Rush is imaginary so something that I've been thinking about is like where does this
(1:13:09) Rush come from so fundamentally if unless you have a network effect business so you have a winner take all market like you're trying to become the Uber of whatever right there's a network effect that one there's one winner who will win and that's it like if you're you're either going to be apple or going to be Android there's no one else in the market like you've got two spots in the market for phone creators and that's it that's the Monopoly right unless you're in one of those settings which 99% of
(1:13:34) businesses are not in that situation I have realized that for me Rush is actually linked to one thing which is my competition reference point which is fundamentally who I choose to compare myself to and so my Rush is entirely arbitrary because I just pick who I'm comparing myself to now here's what's kind of crazy do you compare yourself to a 5-year-old do you look at a five-year and be like what a loser they don't have a business as big as me no of course not right but the thing is is that why wouldn't you compare yourself to a 5-year-old well because they haven't had any time and because they are not
(1:14:07) developed yet but the thing is is that they're another human just like you and they will eventually now like let's fast forward 20 years now they're 25 and let's say they're crushing it do you now compare yourself to them why do you compare themselves at 25 and not at 5 no real reason because we think it's acceptable to compete uh against that particular ular person and so for me the realization that Rush is entirely linked to who I choose to compare myself to meant that it's entirely made up in my mind so I can just change who I compare
(1:14:36) myself to or I could try to compare myself less much more difficult and so in thinking about this it's more how does this comparison change what I do every day and if it changes my actions that decreases the likelihood that I achieve my long-term goals then these comparisons hurt me and so the question that follows from the comparisons is how does this serve me and if it doesn't then why do it like do you feel guilty in middle school that you aren't the richest person in the world well then why do you feel guilty at 30 I'm not saying that's my my goal in life it's
(1:15:05) not but like fundamentally you don't like you don't like flipping roles when you're in Middle School do you feel like a loser because you're not making money maybe a couple people right but y'all are weird right but most people in middle school you're like oh my God I have you know I'm getting chest hair or whatever the hell right you're like I'm navigating life right now like I'm a child look at my limbs they're longer right and so the thing is is that we just choose to enter this comparison game but we're all
(1:15:31) going to die and all of our stuff's going to go right back into the middle and other people are going to play with our chips so who cares and if this Rush is is impacting your business then you need to find a way to quell it which is either stop comparing change your compare yourself to now a third door is to compare yourself to Your Heroes at that stage in their lives right which is where was Warren Buffett at age 35 okay am I on track with him but again you're not going to be Warren Buffett because Warren Buffett lived through the greatest growth in in American history and was B born at the perfect time right
(1:16:03) and he also bought his first stock when he was seven did you buy your first stock when you were seven no there goes there goes my 5-year-old analogy so if you didn't buy your first stock when you were seven you're not wor buff it now you can model his behavior to have outcomes that will be probably proportionately smaller than his but that's okay it's only a problem if you think it's a problem so the next big category of kind of growth Trends or Focus for the year of 2025 my big lessons was was branding so I talk about
(1:16:26) branding a lot and that's because it's really important but I I had a one day where I spent with uh Ben Francis so he came out to Vegas for the Olympia and then we spent the day together came a day early which is great and we just hung out and NL Mack who's his head of uh brand was there with him and we got to spend a wonderful time talking about Brandon General and they told me this story that has really stuck with me I got to actually connect through them with the CMO of New Balance and so this is the story new balance is CMO they're both had plateaued after a number of
(1:16:57) years and so they were kind of stagnant and they needed to shake things up so he became the CMO of everything and he went to the CEO and said hey can I just swing really big and the CEO said sure and so then he said I want to take our spend which right now is 70% bottom of funnel and 30% top of funnel and I want to flip these two things I want to make 30% bottom and 70% top and you like what does that mean this is is brand awareness storytelling associations that you make with different athletes that is all top of funnel like wow new balance
(1:17:37) is cool right the bottom of funnel stuff is buy shoes right and so after doing this what was crazy is that for the first 18 months they made less money and so the company's return on their advertising budget went down for 18 months but on month 19 it went like this Boop it started going up and then it went up even more and then it went up even more and so they've had this massive rebirth from this shift and strategy and so when I heard that story it was really compelling for a number of reasons for me and it changed my behavior so number one was this is a
(1:18:18) good ratio to think about in terms of investing in an audience versus kind of withdrawing from the audience and the reason the 7030 I found interesting is that in the $100 million leads book I talk about this at length but there's been a there's been a a 3:1 ratio that's been studied by television it's been studied by radio which is content right to ads so if you're on your Facebook Newsfeed and you scroll every three posts the fourth post will be an ad all right if you're on YouTube it might be number of minutes now they have ai and all this stuff but for the the typical one it's a 3:1 ratio now
(1:18:54) this ratio is what is required to basically keep a brand keep a Channel people keep coming back now if they change this to two to1 all of a sudden people stop watching that channel they stop watch they switch to something else right and so that ratio being reflected here I see as a human thing and so I think to myself okay I need to make sure that I always keep my ratio at least 3 to one in terms of value driven and now you can think about this in terms of views like Impressions per person cuz that's what would really matter or you can think about this in dollar spend if you want to think about it from a budgeting perspective but for me I think
(1:19:29) about this at the individual level I want to make sure that someone's getting at least three or four positives from any kind before they have any kind of ask for me to do something now the netn net world is that if your product is exceptional the ask is not an ask because they're excited to buy something else from you and so this is why brand and product longterm are interwoven together your reputation with somebody will be reinforced or diminished by the quality of the product because you make a promise with your advertisement and
(1:20:01) you deliver on that promise or overd deliver on their promise with the product and if it's worse now you got to put more in the bucket here to kind of like get them to be willing to take another shot with you again or if you have a really good product the amount that you have to put back in here is actually less you could sell something else even faster so if Apple came out with the next iPod right people would be really excited about it and if the next day they said hey we also have this other amazing thing that doesn't necessarily compete with the iPod as long as you had the money which is a
(1:20:33) different question as long as you had the money or financing available you'd be excited to buy the next thing too provided the first thing was awesome and so this is the idea is that products can reinforce brand and should be the thing that reinforc brand over the long term which is why I want everybody to read my books first because the books have been the the pieces of content that I put more single time in than anything else I put 2,000 plus hours in each of those books like no joke 2,000 plus hours and
(1:20:57) so they are the single best pieces of content that I will likely ever make and they will outlive me these videos will go away like podcasts will disappear but the books will remain that is why I want everyone to read them which is why I've made them free like you can listen to them on my podcast for free and if you like hard versions you go on my site or you go on Amazon you can grab them all right uh they have you know 26,000 five stars there's a million copies that have been sold and it's because they're good right it's and and and it's because I put so much time into them and so this
(1:21:24) lesson first off was important for me because the ratio and it corroborated what we what I kind of already think about in terms of content in giving to asking the other piece that I thought was really interesting was the time delay which is that he made this shift and then he had to wait a year and a half and that's given the size budget New Balance has which means that if you want to build a brand you've got to expect you got to measure in years you're not going to build a brand in months it's just not
(1:21:46) going to happen people see my brand now but like my first YouTube videos also started at zero my first Facebook page started at zero like everyone not my first Instagram started like at zero like everybody else and so it just takes time like my first YouTube videos I think was 2019 right and so like don't expect to have a 10-year outcome in 12 months one of the questions that I ask myself is like okay for Branding for cpg companies so for companies that sell to Consumers dirting consumer The Branding
(1:22:10) Playbook is very well tested right you go find uh influencers in that world or brands that are similar you do collaborations with them you basically cross over on values their values become similar to yours you kind of rub off on one another you go find Champions and athletes that are top of their field you make the associations people then want to buy your product because of that associate and the history of positive reinforc they had with that particular athlete okay now I was like how do I do this in a B2B setting right and so I have split this up into basically two major categories if I want to build a
(1:22:44) brand in a B2B setting right you typically want to educate your audience because you want to be positioned as an authority so if you're an accountant you're a lawyer whatever it is you want to be known as somebody who knows what they're doing right and so category one is you help them accomplish their goals for free very simple so a lot of this is going to be content right like this is why we brand with content is that if you like what's the most positive Association someone can have they have a goal you help them achieve it okay so they will link their goal achievement to
(1:23:14) your help great the next thing is that you help someone like them so it's an approximation which is okay I am a lawyer and I help someone negotiate some deal and that person and I and I have to advertise it I have to let people know about it but me seeing that as a plumber and this lawyer only helps plumbers negotiate these deals I say oh someone just like me got exactly what I want so this is a degree removed the next one is that you do the aspirational outcome yourself now both of these can be aspirational to be clear
(1:23:44) and this was actually something that Ben and I talked about a lot Ben Francis which was often times brands are built on the aspirational because it's almost like an extreme version that I translate into decreasing risk of purchase so let me explain so Northface can help people get to Everest and so if it's really cold at the top of Everest if I buy that jacket it will likely keep me warm on the way to work from my car to the door if Range Rover makes an ultimate outdoor vehicle and that they're the off ultimate off-roader then it'll probably help me if I have to get over a curb
(1:24:21) right it's these extreme versions that get regressed down to well if it can do that then it'll probably help me with my thing right seum is the best fitness influencer right now in this generation and so if he wears this stuff to compete at the Olympia and train for the Olympia then for me to just trying to be the strongest guy at my gym it'll probably work for me and so the question is what is that aspirational outcome like Red Bull if I could iy could drink the Red Bull and jump out of space then it'll
(1:24:49) probably get me a little bit motivated when I have 5 hours of sleep right like you notice the theme here like all of these brands have these big aspirational outcomes there's a reason that my brand grew when I had a $46 million exit because it was an aspirational outcome now what I'm trying to do now and I've been public about that is cross a billion dollars like that's the goal and when that occurs my brand will be reinforced it'll be strengthened because it'll be an aspirational goal for more people now the good news is a $50 million exit or $46 million exit is a
(1:25:18) good enough occurrence for many people now a different aspirational thing might be our portfolio performance now we're worth significantly more than when we had that exit but it's less validated it's less thirdparty signed off and when we have that sign off it'll become validated I'll give you a fun story on this the amount of people that gave me kudos for selling gym launch was significantly more than the people who gave me kudos for owning gym launch but the owning of gym launch I was richer the day before I sold the company than the day after because the equity in the
(1:25:49) business compounded taxfree and the moment I sold it I had to pay taxes on what I gained and so by definition I had less money after the transaction than before but everyone perceived it because there was the third party edification that occurred because the third party at arms length made the transaction happen and so it was real but as long as you don't live in the minds of other people's perceptions which to be fair in branding you kind of do you don't want your selfworth to be tied in their perception but your brand ultimately will be and so the idea is the question to answer if you're a B2B business and
(1:26:20) you're trying which is over half of businesses are B2B fun dead I didn't know I was looking this up for school actually is that these are basically your buckets is how do I help them do what they want how do I help people like them and how can I accomplish something aspirational in their mind or help other people like them accomplish that aspirational thing and this is where like you can help them accomplish their goals or the aspirational goal it's either of those things but the aspirational one I find incredibly interesting because some people saw the
(1:26:45) book launch last year uh for the $100 million leads we had a gazillion people there live it was awesome and they were like I would like to do something like that and so that in of itself was a brand reinforcing event and so big picture this is what I see as the process for building AB Tob brand because it's not like you're going to like think about like this if you're the if you're an attorney you're not going to sign the top attorney you know O.
(1:27:09) J Simpson's attorney I can't remember it's the Kardashians X I can't remember what Jenner anyways no that's Bruce Jenner forget about it you get the idea is that like if you a business person then it's like elon's not going to endorse you right it's not going to happen and so it's like you have to do the other things that Cano proximate your proficiency with proof and so the final T tldr of this is you have resources this is what your brand must accomplish this is the timeline that it has to go off of this is the ratio you need to follow and this is how you spend your
(1:27:40) money in time to make these things happen for the audience and that's how you do it and so this has been my focus uh one of the big kind of like crystallizations of knowledge maybe deepened uh my understanding of branding and how it translates back into forth between D Toc and B2B shiron Sasa good friend of Leila n currently the the CEO of real also has sillo Capital which is his his uh investment firm he gave me this little quip that I really like and he said Talent only gets better in the future and that has been I mean you'll notice a common theme around people in this and that's because when I look at the things
(1:28:16) that we did really well with this year is bring good people in get bad people out and the companies that did the best Mor folio like that that strategy rank fruit like the the the the the highest performing company the portfolio we put in probably like six great leaders and it's just crushing and that that's not an accident right so that's thing number one in terms of talent the second thing is work with the people who move towards you and so I have spent too much time in my life trying to sell people on why they should do things my way or with my
(1:28:48) values or with my kind of rules which I Define culture as rules of reinforcement in a business so like these are the rules of the game as I would like to play it and I noticed that if I kind of have this like kind of recurring conflict with a handful of people I was like I don't need to do this like there's another person who is stoked to be here will agree with the path and it'll be so much more efficient because they'll want to talk to me I want to talk to them we agree to the rules of the game the way we both want to play it
(1:29:19) and so we'll just play that much better that much longer and so this is more of like a warning shot because I think what happens is you habituate especially if you're an entrepreneur you have a high pain tolerance like you're used to like you're used to suffering suffering is just the the current state and so sometimes someone comes in things are okay sometimes they change sometimes you change whatever but fundamentally conflict emerges and if you cannot resolve the conflict then over time your communication cycle lessens and lessons you start talking less and less frequently and if this person is close
(1:29:49) to you or close to your function it becomes very difficult to basically for them to do their job and for you you to get what you need out of the role and so um my my single line of advice is work with the people who move towards you and so a a correlat second point of that that's a different frame to Think Through is if your team doesn't admire some aspects of you you either have to change them or you have to change you like this is a tough one though because you want like this is my opinion if your team doesn't admire certain things about
(1:30:18) you then the likely that you have strong influence over their behavior outside of basically punishment is low and it's much better in my opinion to have a team who admire different traits of yours now they don't have to say everything you do is amazing but like there are there skills you have there are behaviors you do that they're like man it'd be really cool if I had that or it's really cool that he has that or she has that and that creates this element of respect in the relationship that I think is really
(1:30:43) required for high performance and you have two choices there like either you change or they change or you get someone else so you change the whole thing right I think making sure that you've established rules of the game and just subtly noticing like is there someone who just like disrespects you on a regular basis or they tried or they're the first one to disagree I want to be clear here I'm not saying that you shouldn't have healthy tension and disagreement at the top it's actually very common like everybody who has like
(1:31:09) different perspectives to yield the best outcome like that's how you get truth so that's that's good but if you're consistently being blocked on what you consider to be like par for course behaviors that can grade on you and I think that I tolerated that for too long um and I have done that for for in different occasions and I I want to shorten the time that I tolerate those kind of Dynamics so next up is sawdust my favorite businesses in the world are businesses that are started off of waste from someone else so let me explain so I
(1:31:42) love the Airbnb and I love Uber the way that like people have excess capacity or sawdust they have something that they're not using that would be valuable for someone else an easy example in a brick and mortar scenario is like I don't use my gym my gym was closed after 8:30 and it was no one used it until 4:30 in the morning and so I'm paying for this rent and I have this space and there's probably some people who would like to have that space but can't right and I didn't have you know weekend hours ended afternoon right and so there many of us
(1:32:13) and Airbnb did this on the residential side obviously like you have a spare bedroom you can let someone crash there and you can make money for it but the thing is is that within businesses you also have excess capacity you have sawdust and so the sawdust analogy comes from Lumber Mills when they would they would strip the Trees of bark they would turn them into planks and then you know they Shi the planks out but a smart Foreman of the factory looked on the ground one day and they had to just keep sweeping up all this dust from the saw and then finally one guy said hey could
(1:32:41) we just mix this with glue and make Plywood And then of all of a sudden a whole new kind of industry was born from that where you could take the scraps and then turn into something else and in the fur business that I did when I was 16 17 18 in there the owner would have to make these jackets and he would cut off these Snippets from the Snippets he was able to make earm muffs and then he was able to sell his ear muffs or give the ear muffs away as bonuses and so he was able to make something from nothing and so there are sawdust things that exist in
(1:33:13) your business and I'll tell you one of the big ones that came from acquisition. comom so our primary business is obviously the portfolio and that's where the majority of our resources are allocated towards and we tried to figure out a way where we could meet more potential portfolio companies so I tried a few different things to come out well the barrier was too low we got mixy matchy and I was like that's not good so we tried that one and we didn't meet good people and I was like all right that's not good so the next thing I did was like okay what if we raise the
(1:33:38) qualifications really high and then we like kind of have these dinners so we did we did like four or five dinners where people would fly out we'd meet them the whole idea for me was like I have to eat either way so I might as well eat with people like again like sawdust like what do I have to I also have to make content so if I go to dinner I make content and I meet people this is all good this helps us generate deals and the reason that I was trying to figure this out was because the best port portfolio companies we have are number one number two number four best
(1:34:02) performing company were companies that we had worked with for 6 to 12 months prior so we had an existing relationship we had helped them grow and then we were like okay I think their portfolio ready now then we made our investment and we and we grew them from there and our best performers were like that so I was like how can I how can I have this happen on purpose rather than by accident so I was I was really struggling with this mind you I was also like running the portfolio too so it it's like I wasn't
(1:34:21) putting full attention towards it and then in January I was like okay well we have this building and we have there's an open open floor space there were a bunch of desks there but I was like weren't using those desks everybody had offices and because we do a lot of like confidential calls and whatnot we're more of an office closed door setup and so we cleared the desks and we're like okay well let's see if some businesses would want to fly out to our headquarters and have us spend like two days kind of going over how we create value because then that way it's like it will provide value to them and the people who are like oh this is really
(1:34:51) cool I would love to potentially like follow up with them over the alol they become they kind of enter a longer term nurture process and we can potentially do deals with those people Etc that's also why we spun up acq Ventures Etc and so that whole division of workshops came out of we have extra space and the portfolio team isn't fully allocated like they work on the portfolio obviously but like they can step down for a day or two uh during the month to meet other companies uh network with them share how they are turning around
(1:35:19) different companies in our portfolio specific divisions or departments and that'll be very additive like we can add value to everyone and adds value to us add to them and I get content from it and so that was a big W and the reason I bring this up is there are some things in your business that check more than one box and so it's like I don't want a single box check I want like four boxes checked and so this generates deal flow this generates cash flow this generates content this generates Talent flow and
(1:35:52) so all of these things and utiliz as a resource that I already have paid for I already I have to pay I pay this building every month right like this cost exists I pay my team every month no matter what either way and so it used an existing cost basis to create a new opportunity for content and deal flow and so from that it's like if you can just look at the pieces you have on the board and this is actually what I do I I try and write down with as much detail what are all the things we do on a regular basis like what are the calls we take what are the conferences we attend what are the like every single thing we
(1:36:21) do and I'm like is there a way I can recombine these things things into something that would be valuable at no cost to me and that's where I've had these really disproportionate gains in profitable divisions or products in our company obviously and then within the portfolio so for example you probably have Sops and checklists within your business right of how you do whatever you do well if you can take that and then turn those into lead magnets then not only are they valuable for you they also generate demand and so that's just a very micro example of like take something you're already doing and find
(1:36:52) another use for it that requires no extra work the next one's really big and so this is a little bit looking forward into 2025 and Beyond and so I believe this so this is a bet so ought be clear this is H this is me making a bet and calling a shot so I believe that IRL and AI exist on polar opposite sze of a Continuum and I think that doubling down on both of these is a good decision and So within our portfolio we are pushing heavily on both sides and so postco I still feel like there's unmet demand for people who want to connect I mean obviously this is why I invested in school like I believe Community is really good and I think
(1:37:33) it's lacking right now so I think there's huge demand for it and we've never we've we've never been more connected and also feel so apart and so it's it's almost like we have a lot of false Solutions it's like we're eating fake food that keeps you full but doesn't satisfy you it's kind of like porn to sex like it's not the real thing right and so the idea is like this is the real thing this is efficiency and so it's like how can I how can I get as much efficiency as possible so that I can do as many of the unscalable things that are the real thing and this IRL
(1:38:04) push that I'm doing I'm doing across all the portfolio companies because the interesting thing about IRL is customers who have in-person experiences have tremendously different brand Affinity they're more loyal they refer more they rate higher they buy more often and if you have a strong culture within your marketing or your branding you will attract ACT like-minded people and so that allows you to provide them value at no extra cost so think about like this if I assemble a party I'm the host of the party everybody who meets at the party feels like the the party was awesome if everyone else at the party
(1:38:40) was great I could not talk to any of the guests and have them think Alex's party was awesome and I will get a disproportionate amount of the reward from the associations and the time they had but that Network allows people who assemble to provide value to each other which is almost like s like you're not you you just organize it and you let them provide the value and so IRL and AI I'm I'm heavily pushing on this this year Sam Alman said that this year is the year AGI will come out 2025 so artificial general intelligence which basically AI is better than everyone at
(1:39:10) everything which is frightening but we'll figure it out in the meantime though it'd be great if it could take some sales calls and uh set some appointments uh pretty accurately so uh and maybe help with some content and things like that uh but in the meantime we're staying really AB breasted on this and we're actively kind of like I'm not trying to be the AI company I want to be a company that uses AI well just to be clear about my position on this IRL though is something that I feel like AI will not disrupt and I think that the demand for inperson experiences uh will continue to rise and I think that it is
(1:39:41) a good bet to make and so this is what I'm betting on next year and I will mention this because a lot of people don't like IRL because they say it's unscalable right but I care so much more about is it valuable and if it's valuable enough it's worth scaling and so the thing is is that just because it's harder doesn't mean it's not worth doing and the benefit of scaling something that is harder to scale but also valuable means that once you scale a little bit more you'll have more resources to continue scaling it and so
(1:40:10) if we can build cities in the middle of the desert or the middle of the ocean we can absolutely scale an in-person experience next fun one is school so what's crazy about this is that this was this year uh which feels like you know an eternity ago but we uh we negotiated the deal in 2023 and then in January we came out publicly with it so this was the first brand deal that I did this year uh or sorry the first brand I've ever done and the main reason behind doing it was that I believed in the product and I believed in the team and I
(1:40:40) thought it was the best one and I think it's going to win and so that is why I was willing to make that bet and to be very clear opportunity always looks like Risk today and this this bet has proven out very well the platform continues to grow like crazy we have millions and millions of users which is awesome and that was kind of the goal and the reason that I I ended up betting on this versus like any other potential thing I could do was it felt very uniquely fit for me so I'll explain what I mean so there's a make money component to school there's a
(1:41:13) education component to school there's a community component to school which I just see as like Plus for for social right and then all of these together aren't an opportunity vehicle that is high leverage and so for those reasons I was like I feel like I am uniquely qualified for Education media would be another one here there's definitely a huge media component with the business so it's like education media business societal good operational leverage this was it was like if you could make a business that hit a lot of the things that I'm about and for me it also help people who are going Z to one
(1:41:50) and I have a huge percentage of the audience that want to start start a business don't have one and didn't know where to go and so I wanted to have something that I could say if you aren't a business owner yet this is a very easy business to get started it's very low risk there's not many moving Parts you can do it without any employees you don't have to have inventory you literally just need to learn the basic skills and so this is a great vehicle for doing it and so I was super pumped uh when we found out that the average Community made
(1:42:20) $1,360 per month that's paid communities and I think that's really cool because it's like no this isn't you're not going to be a gazillionaire by doing this but it can help get you started and that I see this as a great Gateway for getting a notch ownership as a side note for existing businesses I think every existing business should have like every gym owner should have a school Community every every realtor should have a community for their for their customers every HOA should have a community uh a school Community for for their for the the people in the neighborhood like
(1:42:48) whatever business you have like if you have an e-commerce business there's a ton of e-commerce businesses joining school right now that realize that the email deliverability like if you can reach 100% of people who bought your product the feedback that you can get on the product the reviews the likely they buy the next thing goes way up and so it's like sure add them to the email list but also add them to a live community and so I see that as again the IRL versus AI like how do we how do we bring people together and so we're also doubling down on that with school because we are not we don't see ourselves I mean obviously it's a
(1:43:17) technology business but like it's a community business and so we're also doubling down on how can we facilitate in inperson connections between people of similar interests so I'll I'll give you some specific lessons that I've learned from uh growing School tremendously over the last year so number one is uh cro usually decreases hold on usually your split test will fail and so basically the more optimized something is the more likely a change from optimal results in a decrease and so our first launch of the school games page did so well that we've done like 14 sorry 16
(1:43:55) major split tests and only two of them have won and so like anything from the like so basically the control is really really dialed and it typically like if you have monstrous amounts of traffic when you incur the cost of change like it is it is a real cost the second kind of thing that I that I would say that like I've learned uh or rather been reinforced from school is kind of customers above everything which is just always a great reminder Paul Graham has this statement that I probably feel like I've said a whole bunch of times this year which is you can solve almost every problem in a business business by
(1:44:23) talking to your customers more like if your marketing isn't working talk to your customers if your sales isn't working talk to your customers if your product isn't working talk to your customers right you you are never too big to not talk to your customers and so that that was a big emphasis the I would say the next one is the the the value of offers it was just you know the school games itself was a really cool offer that we came up with and then we added in um you can win a cybertruck if you if you win which which made it even crazier and so the the uplift that a business
(1:44:53) can get from having a superior offer we got to see that you know it's just it's nice to see things proven out so that was a really good one the next big lesson I'll put this one this is really big is the value of deletion and simplicity so I'll explain what I mean here so we have tried to make it as easy as humanly possible for people to win on the platform and we get better and better every day but a big part of it is is the number one reason people cancel things is overwhelm and so overwhelm translates into zero value because they stop so what happens is people hear overwhelm and then add more stuff and so
(1:45:25) it's it's rare that addition improves things rather than simply making things better or taking something out and make and replacing it with something better or eliminating it all together like you want it to be as simple as possible but no simpler right like if you if you take away all the friction that occurs from using a phone what's left is an iPhone right the only next version of that would be you just talk in the air and then like you get connected with people like that would be the next version of that but what Steve Jobs did was inorder of magnitude Improvement off of the
(1:45:54) existing phones and he just looked at all the things that suck about a phone removed all of them and what was left was the iPhone and so thinking about product and value this way right so the value equation you've got the outcome you've got the risk right you've got speed and then you've got uh you've got you've got uh effort right so the idea is how do we make it faster and easier faster and easier faster and easier over and over and over again on this value equation and a lot of times what makes things faster and easier is removing things and so I have grown more and more Affinity towards looking at what's there
(1:46:29) and saying okay we need to maximize value per second not seconds of value and so this comes from the media side uh in terms of making content but on the product side like every customer will ask you for different things and they will and if you give them every single thing they ask for they will cause their own demise and then leave and so then you get these Frankenstein products that have a gazillion gizmos that no one knows how to use because to fit it all in it's like there's a 100 specific use cases that don't apply to everyone and so product discipline around keeping
(1:47:00) Simplicity and speed and and ease as the primary goal is an incredibly difficult thing to focus on and making those strategic bets and so that has been a great Focus uh and kind of uh relearning I would say uh of this year with school and I would say finally having like knowing what your what Your Loop is all right so it's like what's your flywheel so Jim Collins has a short book on this called the flywheel I think or flywheel effect and it's basically like can you draw a circle within your business which is first we do this which then if we do
(1:47:33) this this is what must occur when this happens this next thing must occur if this occurs this next must occur right and so I I'll show you what what what I'm talking about so if we make a lot of media right for businesses so we make a lot of Business Media if we do that then we will get business owners who Interest Who who interested in our stuff right and if we get business interested business owners who are interested in our stuff right they will then do deals if we do deals with them we'll have stuff to make media about and so this is
(1:48:07) a basic wheel of acquisition. comom we talk about business stuff that gets businesses interested we do deals with those businesses those businesses get outcomes which then we talk about in the media and so round and around we go we want a wheel that feeds itself and so the only thing that's required is to get the wheel moving and So within school we have multiple different Loops that we have that generate the growth that compounds within the business and these Loops are so important because when you
(1:48:31) have a linear input output equation in terms of how business grows then it means that you just have to keep adding more on the front end what you want is something that you spark once the engine runs and then all of a sudden it spins spins and goes out of control and it just keeps growing right and so that is the ultimate goal is having multiple of these flywheels so a simple example is like Amazon they create a Marketplace that has the cheap cheapest products that are the that have the highest Fidelity in terms of um the risk that someone has to make when they purchase
(1:49:00) because they have the reviews so if they do that then they will get more customers if they have more customers then they will be able to get more suppliers if they have more suppliers they able to get more competition in selection for customers which then brings in more customers right and so round and around we go and so it's businesses often have multiple flywheels like this that exists that self- reinforce and the quality of that flywheel what you want to figure out is what are the what are the friction points that prevent this wheel from
(1:49:23) spinning and then smooth it out so it just runs so this is probably I would say uh number five in terms of the things that I I've gotten away from school this year and school is probably one of the best investments I've ever made so this year and somewhat last year we uh we got this great office right and uh part of the reason we did this is because I wanted to have a massive gym I'm being really honest with you like I wanted to have a really big gym which I have and I wanted to have a place that I could record that wasn't like out of my house or out of a closet as much as it
(1:49:49) is great to have my team in and out of my personal space um I prefer it in a studio and so uh that was the reason for building this to begin with then we started having a lot of teammates just started like spending more time here and they're like may maybe I'll move here and so then we started to become more and more in person as a business and so I will remind anyone I started in person exclusively with gyms then we went to gym launch which was entirely a remote business and we were entirely remote
(1:50:13) before it was cool like we were entirely remote when people were like you can't be a remote business it's not legit for real like we like we would struggle to get like some banking relationship cuz they're like we need to I remember there was some software that we needed that were like we need to see a picture of your filing cabinet and I was like what year is it but it's like it was Antiquated until Co and then became the norm and so I want to talk about pros and cons to this because some of you guys are business owners and you're
(1:50:37) trying to make this decision and so number one I think is understanding which roles are remote and which roles are in person so for us because we know how to manage I think remote teaches you how to manage better than in person does because there's so many ancillary small Communications that occur in person that don't get documented remotely that still have a material impact on the business and so if you're only remote you have to be very structured with communication if you're in person you can get away with a
(1:50:59) lot less now four roles like fundamentally we say like why does this person need to be here we would only want people to be here who should be here if you know if Finance doesn't really need to be in the office and so that allows us to recruit from a wider net so we can recruit from all over the United States rather than requiring people to move uh or only picking from call it Las Vegas right and so for us the pros have been training is much better in person culture is much stronger uh I think you have an eye to efficiency which to be fair is somewhat offset with the additional cost of the building I think that you're able to see
(1:51:33) people in deep work and correct meeting cadences things like that like if you're walking around everyone's on meetings all days you're like who's working right uh and so this allows you to you get faster feedback loops which I think is important the cons of in person is that harder attract talent because they have to move that's a big one it's probably the biggest one but it's easier to attract other people though so for us what we did to accommodate this is we for some roles depending on the level of the role we will also uh include signing
(1:51:57) bonuses and things like that so if you're in that position including more incentive for them to move or move their families to your place of business is a is is a good way to do it I also recommend having them come out for like 30 days and stay at a hotel just so that they don't like you know deant their whole family if for some reason it doesn't work out kind of in the first month you'll know and so um that's that's like a little in between that I think is worth doing that has worked well for us to be to be clear for me I think 30% of our portfolio is in person 70% of remote so I don't have I I don't
(1:52:27) care at all about how someone chooses to have you know structure their employee teams I think you should just whatever way it is I just want there to be sound reasoning behind it and so for us obviously we have a lot of media and so having the entire media team here makes sense because I film here I'm here and so they should be here too whereas like I said Finance it doesn't really make sense and so it's just making sure that like you're not being a stickler in either direction for the sake of it and
(1:52:50) instead just saying like what problem are we solving and which path increases the likelihood that it gets solved so this year I actually made a lot of personal improvements in terms of my environment and I'll share some of those with you right now and so as I was saying earlier you know I worked a lot more days this year a lot more hours per day than I probably worked in recent history and I needed to optimize more things it's kind of like when a car is driving at 60 miles an hour it's like it moves a little bit when you're at 200 miles an hour tiny movement makes a huge change was kind of the same thing in terms of me and so with the increase in
(1:53:20) hours the increase in days I was like I need to get everything else dialed and so one massive one which is going to sound so silly is the big three of sleep so number one is Pitch Black and when I say pitch black I mean pitch black so tape the little lights on all the electronics in the room get blackout curtains I'm telling you just do it I took way too long to do it just do it just do it please do it number one number two is it's got to be cold like it has to be super cold and if you are in a different temperature than the person you sleep with then get one of those mattress pads that has the temperature control thing it will change
(1:53:56) your life and it will certainly change your sleep which could very much change your life just do it like it's it's I think they're they're like two grand and you spend more time in bed than anywhere else like it's the Wellspring of Youth it's everything like worth doing and the third one and this is the most recent one is that I actually added in earplugs so I now sleep with earplugs which you just the simple foam ones like nothing crazy and sleeping with earplugs had a four beats per minute drop to my resting heart rate at the bottom of my sleep and
(1:54:31) so I bring this up because like it had a material difference in basically how deeply I rest and my deep sleep is basically very chunky and front loaded rather than like intermittent throughout the evening so it's like basically as soon as I get to bed I have like deep sleep because I hear no it's like I'm in this black float tank essentially this cold dark tank where I can't see anything or hear anything and so you you'll know when it's dark enough if when you open your eyes and when you close your eyes it's the same that's where you want to be and so those are
(1:55:03) some those are some significant ones the next big one for me was making sure that my work environment was basically just as tailored and so I've usually been better about this but I always black out my windows because I get distracted with good weather I just want to go outside and so I black all that stuff out I had two desks that I set up one for standing one for sitting because I realized that having a desk that moved I ended up just not moving it cuz I didn't want to like mess the wires up and like all the other stuff so I just set up two desks and so that was uh helpful the biggest pain
(1:55:32) relief thing that I did this year because I spent a lot of time on my desk is I got a kneeling chair all right which sounds ridiculous and they look goofy but if you sit in one position all day like I was getting really bad uh neck pain uh like it was very tough for me um and so by switching the kneeling chair originally I thought I was going to do my day in one chair half my day in the other chair but then I realized that when I was in the kneeling chair I actually have like six different sitting positions that I do in that chair and so by constantly varying my sitting
(1:56:04) position because as soon as I get a little bit uncomfortable I just I just change it up I was able to basically decrease the resting stress on like my muscles being in this one Frozen position for an extended period and that eliminated my shoulder pain like gone and so I like really really helped me out a lot and so I don't I don't know what you're doing but like it was probably like a 100 bucks and like such high Roi for me and then the last piece is actually around my fitness so because I was in this very heavy season I
(1:56:33) decrease my workouts to two a week which is pretty light for me but I just made those the absolutes so I basically did Saturday Sunday as my two workout days and I just go really hard on those days and that's actually kind in a weird way it's been more fun for me than trying to do shorter more frequent workouts and so it's actually kind of brought some like more life back into my training even though though I'm doing it less frequently I'm like looking forward to it and I realized that for me I love
(1:56:58) training on one condition that I'm not in a rush like I hate having to like do a workout in 45 minutes because I have a call like it takes all the fun out of it for me and so I do it on Saturdays and Sundays because I can just wake up I will work out as long as I feel like and then I'll start working and that's been like really really good for me but part of this has also been my transition U at 35 I told myself you know when I was 15 I get 35 I will I will transition to longevity and so I have made that transition now and so I'm like I'm
(1:57:30) probably the lightest I've been in a long time I'm like 203 is right now which is very light for me for context my heaviest I was 250 so I was very it's all all steak um and so now I'm I'm 203 and um basically chihuahua live longer than Great Danes uh which is small dogs live longer and so I want to put it you know less less uh stress on my heart and so I'm so for those who are like Alex looks smaller that's true cuz I am I have lost weight I've lost about 10 or 15 pounds and so I'll probably stay around here maybe I'll get in the high
(1:58:00) 190s but I'll probably I I maintain here pretty easily and so that's my update on that that part and I do think that it's okay to have seasons like I'm not saying I'm only going to work out twice a week forever I'm saying I'm work out twice a week now like I I worked out three times this week and so it's not like I have these rules it's just that I absolutely committed to Saturdays and Sundays and being a weekend warrior and that has worked well for me to not work basically give myself permission to do that so that I could keep working hard on the
(1:58:22) stuff that needed to get moved forward so next one is culture so I Define culture as the rules that govern reinforcement in a business and so that means like the rules of behavior what is what is what is good what is neutral what is bad and typically people have some sort of values that they create that are supposed to embody that culture those values typically are you know either phrases or they're one or two words and you have you know three to 10 of them right and so for us I've always believed in three because I don't think anyone beli like remembers more than three and if they can't remember them there's no point in having them but those three typically are very bucketed
(1:58:57) terms that then need to have hundreds of behaviors underneath them that kind of roll into that culture it's not like you only have three rules of Behaving you have three concepts that have many applications across different conditions and so a big one that we've been focusing on Lea and I together has been kind not nice and so I think that in the wake of wokeism if you will there's been a lot of accommodation that has been accepted tolerated within businesses which is like everybody needs to have these like you know safety zones and everyone everyone everyone has to feel
(1:59:29) hugged and fluffy and like all this stuff and I believe that this is a pendulum right and I think that the pendulum swung here and I think a lot of Brands Walmart just came out recently rolling back some of its initiatives I know uh Victoria Secret did last year like a lot of them are starting to swing back now I do think that we're going to swing too far the other way to be clear because that's how we do that's how us humans do things right but I think it's going in the right direction right now which is going back towards the middle
(1:59:53) and so uh within acquisition. comom we have this big belief that we're very good at training like we're very good at training skills because it's something that Lea and I pride ourselves on and we're in this inperson environment we're good at fast feedback loops we're very good at breaking skills down uh into smaller chunks to make them manageable for somebody who's new the problem is that sometimes that goes into no man left behind and we are not a government program instead it should be if you can't keep up you can't come and so I think this is a departure from the traditional like all accepting let's all
(2:00:22) all arms open like if someone you know has like you know they don't like working late it's like well then this isn't for them and they can find another job that's that that will accommodate that but I do not because we were trying to accomplish great things and great things require great sacrifice and it doesn't feel like a sacrifice to the person who also wants the great thing it only feels like a sacrifice for someone who doesn't and so that price diminishes for someone who's aligned and so kind not nice also brings into into light like being able to have these sincerely canderous conversations of saying like
(2:00:51) you are not where you need to be and I'm going to give you a really good nug on this is that right now you can pause this video and I need you to show it to your team because what they don't understand is the difference between an insult and you might not understand it either and this this like changed my life insult and criticism so do you know the difference well I'll explain it so an insult is where basically you slander the other person you assign a word that has a negative connotation so I say
(2:01:16) something like you are lazy you are uh a piece of [ __ ] you're a dick you whatever whatever insert insert the insult you want a criticism is the gap between desired and actual this is a commentary which is factual which is the expectation is that you show up every day by 9:00 a.m.
(2:01:44) you've shown up every day at 9:05 therefore there's discrepancy here in order for you to continue maintaining your employment you need to be here before night so this is a criticism it's simply observing reality and if you can do this this will allow you to help people without having the emotional charge now if I say you're 5 minutes late and you're that makes you lazy or that makes you uncommitted or that makes you insert whatever insult it then turns this into an emotionally charged conversation and so what happens is and this is why I think it's important is that you need to explain to your team criticism is not negative it's an
(2:02:14) observation of reality an insult is where we attach judgment to that discrepancy like your content sucks that's tough and the the secondary of that is you suck because your content sucks which is even harsher but instead it says our Channel average is 100,000 the content that you make is 75,000 in order for you to keep your employment here you need to be above 100,000 and now let's break down what do we need to do behaviorally that will increase the likelihood that you meet desired or exceed it and so then this is where you get to teach this is where you get to train if someone's always late to meetings they might not be lazy they
(2:02:55) just might not have the skill of showing up on time which is a skill and so you then say okay do you set alarms how do you estimate your time of driving do you do it on the fastest time you've ever driven somewhere or the slowest time you've ever driven somewhere right do you do it on the fastest time you've ever gotten dressed or the slowest time you've ever gotten dressed and so typically when people estimate time they usually just skew to one of these two things there's the people who are always way too early it's because they do worst
(2:03:18) case on everything and then you've got the people who are they do best case on everything and they're always late right so it's like how do you estimate time and how do you set reminders for yourself to get places by the time you need to and so literally breaking down that skill which seems obvious and yet there's many young people and to be fair sometimes old people who don't know how to show up on time and so understanding this and saying if we don't share this criticism we are being nice not kind we are not we are seeking we are seeking
(2:03:48) contentment we are seeking approval from everyone we are seeking consent we're not seeking truth and so we need to be truth seeking as a business and so we must always State the facts and tell the truth and if someone is not up to Snuff we need to communicate that as fast as possible and give them the steps in order to remedy the situation and so this is the part I think both of these things get missed bosses will say he's a dick he's lazy he's whatever and sometimes we'll say to the person sometimes we say behind their back both of those are bad instead I would
(2:04:17) encourage you to go criticism and then steps so the way to do this is you say tell them what to do instead so don't just say don't do this say do this instead of this that way you give them directions because no one can operate on a negative give them what to do and this has dramatically improved my skill as an operator with within the business and hopefully the kind not nice is something that you can give to your team and that you can say is like we are here to be kind I want to help you win but I'm not
(2:04:47) here to be your friend and I think Reed Hastings has a really wonderful frame around this which is like we are professional sport team trying to win the World Championships we are not a family cuz you're not going to fire your kids you're not going to fire your spouse you're not going to fire your mother but if you're on a professional sports team it's like we are all here to win and if you don't want to win this is not the team for you there's Triple A there's other teams there's other teams that are Pros that don't want to win and that's fine but that's not what we have
(2:05:10) here and so the kindest thing that I can do for someone is give them clear feedback and opportunity to improve and if they don't improve give them the opportunity to work at a place where they will better fit in now that it's been 5 years and I'm back into operating day-to-day on the media and conversion team that we have at acquisition.
(2:05:29) comom it's been fun to turn things around now I already went through the optimization framework and that's what I executed but the output of that was number one I removed all meetings number two I said you can have ad hoc uh stand-ups between each other when you want to solve a specific problem so I don't want to I don't want to stop communication I just want to stop regular wasted time blocks that don't increase your output the next thing and to be fair when I did all my one-on-ones uh with every single person in the department to understand and what they were struggling with one of the biggest things that came back was we're in meetings all day we hate being in
(2:05:56) meetings I just want to work and I was like great let me make it easier for you to work the next thing was uh and this was feedback that I got from some of the managers when they saw me running this was they saw a framework that I like a lot which is what who when so think about when you have a meeting and you're like hey we got to do this thing right that's the what all right then a lot of times that's it that's the meeting everyone just goes about their step way this the next level of that is okay this is what it is and this is who needs to
(2:06:24) do it so who's going to own this who's going to own this one right who's the the chest to chest to poke the throat to choke all right who's the one who's responsible now if you have what and who that's already a better stop but where it gets really nasty is when you put in when and so the question that I like to ask here is how many hours will this take I don't ask how many days I don't ask what day you're going to get it done by I say how many hours will this take and then that person will say it'll probably take because then you get to hear it so it's like if someone says
(2:06:49) like 20 hours I'm like 20 hours right but if if you ask them what day they might be like ah today's Tuesday I can get to you by Friday I'm like why is it going to take 3 days right so when you ask hours it's like this will probably take I don't know 90 minutes I'm like Okay cool so you can get this done in the next 90 now they will then say well I have them other things to do I'm like okay what are those things and then you get to dive in and this is fundamentally I think the job of the boss is to prioritize this is strategy and they're like oh well I have this other thing that's for this massive project and I have to get that done I'm like well how
(2:07:19) long does that take and they'll say okay this many hours and say okay do that first and then this one you can start on tomorrow morning you'll have it done by lunch so hit me up at noon tomorrow when you have it done now people get scared about this because they're like why are you driving all these deadlines the more deadlines you have the more opportunities you have to say nice job I would rather tell someone you did a great job seven times in a week than once a week and so I also have found that the best performers want to work and they hate not working and they hate things that get in the way work they hate office politics they hate meetings
(2:07:48) they hate gossip they just want to work and so I want to create an environment for those people people and if there are a bunch of people who want to gossip and want to have lots of meetings and want to idate all day amazing just not here with the who when framework this also gets stacked and recapped all right so think about how a meeting runs right so okay first thing we got to do is this okay what is it who's got it when are you going to get done by how long is that going to take can I pull it up can I pull it up can I pull it up yep that's fine all right great next one what's the
(2:08:16) next thing great who's going to own it how long's it going to take great you'll do it by this time and then so what we do is is I will recap every one of them every time and so by the time I've done my fourth one they've heard one four times two three times the third one two times and so there's this repetition that's gets built in and then obviously the thing at the very end is also be the freshest so it's like I can repeat the least the thing that's the most fresh and the thing that I started with which is like way out of their mind at this
(2:08:42) point has been repeated like seven times and so it makes it more likely that they will actually do it now if you want to go the 2011 version which I had to do for a little bit was repeat it it back to me so I would say okay got it that's what you're going to do say it back to me and I kid you not if you ask him to say it back this is crazy like one out of three times they'll just completely get get it wrong it's because they weren't listening they weren't paying attention whatever and so I'm like oh my God I can't believe that I was about to
(2:09:07) leave this meeting and they still they didn't understand what they needed to do and so you can stack the who what win you recap it all the way through and then if you have a team that's not doing as well ask them have them explain it back to you so they know what needs to happen now once you have this Loop in place what do we do we lubricate it we add money we add incentives so how can we align what they do with the outcome of the business and so back into Ops I looked at everything eliminated all the meetings and then I said okay in this
(2:09:35) department everything is based on quality and so we just need to make better stuff and so I said if you make better stuff I will pay you more I'd rather have one guy who makes three times the money than three mediocre guys in a very real way it's easy easier for me to manage one person there's way less communication there's way less overhead way less waste and we'll get better outcomes and so if you're like okay I understand how you did all this but how did you communicate with them if they had no meetings so I just switched to a
(2:10:05) daily standup which is every day same time uh we all hop on and I run departments like sales teams all right and I think that you can do this with any business and the reason that I like modeling sales teams for two reasons one I have a lot of experience with them two I believe that the way sales teams are structured and operated have already been optimize for performance because the feedback loops are so tight if you're not managing your sales team well you find out very quickly and as soon as you fix how you operate it you find out very quickly and so I think that sales teams overall are run typically very
(2:10:33) well now what are the things about sales teams so for new people when they come in what do they do they listen to a lot of gam tape this works for customer service this works for media this works for sales they watch a lot of the right way to do things then what happens there's a lot of role playing in sales so it's if you could roleplay in customer service you could role playay around what would you look at with this piece of content what would be the moments that you would clip out how would you structure it and you ask them to explain the work that they would do
(2:11:02) that's when someone new is coming in and then we say okay we're going to give you a half calendar if you're a sales guy I'm going to give you a half calendar for your customer service I'm going to give you a half calendar for media to make sure you're not posting tons of crap you're just get one post a day and then if you do a good job you meet kpis then you get a full calendar then I can give you an UNCA calendar right so we have these progressions as long as they mean maintain their quality metrics and so like sales we have a similar
(2:11:25) onboarding process the Huddle process itself is let's look at the good stuff and let's tear about apart the bad stuff so we' review a call that went well great and the far more valuable let's look at a call that wasn't that didn't go the way it should have and we let the person who did the call correct themselves so it's really tough if you go jump in and like jump down everyone's throat and tell them why they sucked it's much easier for them to say these are the things that I messed up and then the team gets to say here's all the things you did well that that way they get some praise from everybody else but they still get to have that feedback and
(2:11:55) then you can prioritize okay this is the thing that's the most important but that still works for customer service it works for product it works for media which is okay why did this clip suck and let's look at it and if you notice a common theme for when Clips suck then you just repeating it and reinforcing it keeps it top of mind we have switched to that process and it has been very good I also got people off the bus who weren't aligned with it and so if you have a change that you want to do and you foresee that people will not be aligned
(2:12:22) with that change then I think that you owe it to the high performers to to create an environment that is only other high performance you want to get it to the point where it's so self-managed and self- policed that if someone comes in and isn't holding pulling their weight they just get removed simple as that and the whole team comes to you like dude I don't think this is the guy right it shouldn't come from you it should come from the culture of the team and that's why you can't have a culture of acceptance where it's no man Left Behind like oh they're not as good as we thought but we're just going to keep
(2:12:50) training them we're keep deploying these resources is not to say that you can't train someone the question is is it worth it so the next big theme along operations so I'll break this into another chunk is technical versus management all right and so this is very common in tech companies right you have a an engineer who's exceptionally talented and you want to give them a way to move up in the company but they don't want to manage people and in most companies the only way to move up is to increase the headcount that's underneath of you and so when I saw saw this within
(2:13:22) our company I was like this feels dumb we should find a way for the best sales guys to keep making more and more money we should find ways for the best media guys to make more more money the best customer service UPS making more and more money especially in the roles that have high leverage so basically the best content creator has more leverage than the best sales guy best sales guy is closer to the reward though to be fair and so the likelihood that what they do generates revenue is much closer whereas
(2:13:45) marketing or content could be significantly further away so there's a discount that's applied there right but big picture is is is there a track for both types of people because there are the people who are experts at something you just want to let them cook and so when I realized that the the the orgs that I basically the divisions that I took over the only way that someone would win was by moving up and when you have a the only reward structure is people underneath of you then what does that incentivize it incentivizes you keeping against to yourself because if
(2:14:13) someone gets better than you then they move ahead of you in the in the line number one number two is it incentivizes the managers and the whole team to always ask to hire more people because if you hire more people then it means they by default move up in the organization the third thing is that whoever is in charge of the promotions and the titles becomes Chief person whose ass we must kiss and that means that if you it basically becomes entirely subjective as to who gets promoted so then the next incentive that
(2:14:44) comes up that's perverse is you want to show how much you're working rather than do work which are different and so this is where people are like if I said what did you do yesterday and I was like you need to give me a th000 bullets you could probably come up with a th000 bullets you're like I tied my shoes and then I stood up straight and then I put one pan my right pan leg on and I put my left pan leg on and so people make it seem like they're just doing all of this work but they don't tie that work to the output of the division and when that happens is when you have misaligned incentives so every
(2:15:15) one of these incentive is perverse in that it doesn't fuel the business but it does fuel costs with this and with the alignance incentives the team post change has more than doubled output more than and so I think the lesson here and I think that we'll probably get to Triple or quadruple like for real maybe I'll do an update later but this has been a recent takeover for me the thing is is that people typically have significantly more output potential if you can tap into what we call discretionary effort which is what is
(2:15:44) that effort above and beyond the minimum required to keep their job so everything above you not getting fired is discretional discretionary effort and in most companies there's a massive amount of effort above not getting fired that is unlockable if the incentives are aligned and so many people can in a very real way triple how much they're doing quadruple how much they're doing only if they're incentivized to and so when you have a political hierarchy it just means elbowing no one teaching each other anything saying we always need to hire
(2:16:16) more people decreasing your output to lowest potential possible as long as you don't get fired and this when coupled with a management style of never firing is a great way to create waste so in order to facilitate this there typically has to be a change in compensation so I've talked about incentives a couple time through here and so my goal is to try and have everything be pay for performance to the highest degree possible now here's where your operations and your Finance team will push back they'll say This is
(2:16:44) complicated why can't we just do it the way everybody else does it because just because it's hard doesn't mean it's worth it so there's a price but there's also a return and so all they are talking about is the price of this thing not what we're going to get from it if I could then go back to that Finance person and say hey and to be fair this isn't me saying anything about my finance I'm saying you might have to deal with this hey if we were able to quadruple our output by creating a more complex incentive structure that might require someone full-time just to manage is the cost of that one person full-time
(2:17:16) managing it worth the increased output of 4X across the entire company duh of course it is but it's more complicated and it's also worth it and so I I bring this up because you will probably get push back if you try and incentivize people on performance it takes more math it takes more tracking but I will I will say one key part which is that if people are going to be paid on performance my recommendation is two things one if you make the transition allow them to keep their existing salaries and then add the
(2:17:45) performance on top and then for new people bring them in and then just have their performance but this allows complete adoption of the new way rapid reinforcement Loop that that they're like this is way better and then ultimately if you make the jumps in comp proportional to the output that you seek to get then you will still make more than the cost so it's like going it's going to the store buying 3x output at twice the price of your 1X it's still a better deal even though it costs more around this pay for performance it will also very clearly demonstrate who is really good and who isn't and I haven't
(2:18:18) really talked about like letting people go who are low performers I'll just only say this one word about it which is bloat is like cancer in a business or it's like weeds in a garden is that bloat naturally occurs people hire more people because the simplest solution is throw money in bodies at stuff and it's often not the right one you have to keep your garden healthy by pruning it by deweeding it you keep a tree healthy by cutting off the Stray branches that are growing in the wrong direction because it's detracting from the growth of the overall trunk and so this is the part
(2:18:53) that that is that is probably contrarian for most of you fire when things are good not when they are bad so when things are good is when you have the most bloat and so it is far better to let people go at that point for low performance because it doesn't feel like the company's losing feels like we're being disciplined if you let people go only when the company performance drops it feels way worse having done both I strongly recommend the other so for example we were very fortunate but during covid prior to co we had been very militant about making sure that we
(2:19:25) were making sure that everyone was efficient and that the that the headcount made sense based on the demand and so when Co hit we had very minimal amounts that we had to change internally in the business and so because of that um I think it was able to maintain morale relatively well during a time when my industry was getting destroyed and there's a number of ways you can do pay for performance and you don't need to have as much performance as you might think in order to incentivize action and so if you're like I don't have budget for that that's okay just just make a
(2:19:56) couple tiers or performance and then you can have flat bonuses by hitting some tiers like you can I mean literally it doesn't have you don't have to think in percentages it can just be flat amounts based on based on tiers and I think it's a very good structure and a good way to test this out is once you figure out your your compensation thing that you want to do back test it so just look at what it would have been the month before and then see what it is and if that makes sense then it's like cool well I'm going to assume the performance is going
(2:20:19) to go up if I pay for that added performance and am I okay with this increase and if so which if you align it with the incentives of the business it should more than pay for itself the structures that I'm talking about with the sales team management functions best in my opinion when you have teams of similar function what that means is like an executive team is going to be very is has many people with very different functions and expertise a customer service team has many people with the same function and expertise and so this
(2:20:44) style of management of you know reviews uh onboarding huddles what did we what could we do better here those are great when everyone does the same thing if everyone does different things you will have a different structure of it's far more round table where everyone's more or less updating and then coming with the discussion topics that affect everybody else and problem solving together more than upskilling together so that's really probably the main difference between those is one is like we're really solving problems together for the majority of time not that you don't do it the other way but the
(2:21:18) majority of time we're solving big problems with disparate teams or different teams diverse teams and then with similar teams homogeneous teams is typically upskilling together and aligning priorities so oh man this is a big one problems and solutions have delays all right so hear me out on this right now you are living with problems that you created 6 months ago and when you begin to implement Your solution the problem will not immediately go away and so there will be this period of time where you're executing a solution on a
(2:21:49) problem that you cost 6 months ago and you will still continue to live with the problem because the solution has not borne fruit yet it hasn't latched in yet it hasn't come to fruition and so you have to give Solutions the amount of time they deserve to work before appraising whether or not they worked to begin with which I recommend doing prior to implementing the solution so basically when you're about to do something to fix some problem say how long do I think this should take before I can say if it worked or not and then stick to that because in the moment you will only incur even more cost which is
(2:22:22) why it's so painful it's like you have this problem and now you're incurring more cost to try and solving it and and you're still suffering the problem and the cost of solving it without the benefit and so this is kind of the endurance part of Entrepreneurship is that you have to keep working without seeing the result of your work you don't need to change anything you need to learn to endure because just because it's not working doesn't mean you're not on the right path and so the easiest way to think about this is like if you were to go to the gym and you start working out and you start eating better you're
(2:22:52) 50 lbs overweight that problem was created years in the past you now incurring the solution is incurring the problem you're still overweight and the cost of the solution which is now you go to the gym now you're not eating the foods you like whatever but you're still overweight and so after 7 days you might think okay well I should stop doing this because it's obviously not working you have to give time time for the solution proportional to the size problem it's solving and if you don't approach it this way and you ignore your problems
(2:23:24) when you scale you scale your problems with you which means that this is why I'm such a believer in solving the problems in order to scale rather than scaling despite my problems because then it just makes my problems bigger hairier and nastier and so if you're living in good times right now you can't rest on The Laurels because it's not from the work you're doing today it's from the work that you did 6 or 12 months ago and this has been a constant reminder for Laya and I when we go through things when things are good we're like what did we do 6 months ago that is causing this
(2:23:55) and if things are bad we ask what did we stop doing or what did we add in in the past that created this too often we look at today and think that our bad days is because of what we did yesterday and it often isn't and so properly attributing where the cause of the solution or problem came from can give you the outside return that you're probably looking for and I'll give you this very tactical tip if you see a a decline and performance in a division or a function of the business you'll it'll typically look like this so let's say let's say that you know you've got this div let's say it's lead flow whatever and then it
(2:24:29) starts flatten out and then it starts going down right so you notice right so what happens is people wake up here and say we don't have enough leads right and so they say okay well show me the ads this week show me the ads last week so the question is what ha like where do you go do you go here or do you go here go here why did we stop growing not why did we start shrinking and so you have to look at where the Delta first occurred and then what happened in this what happened leading up to here what did we change often times it's a who and
(2:25:05) here's a fun one a lot of people think oh we must have lost someone key most of the times you added someone you added someone terrible I'm dead serious we had uh we had an issue where our uh our Ascension rates all of a sudden sudden like I know I was like why are Ascension you know we started looking at all these different we looked at did all the functions we looked at messaging all this stuff and finally I was like and Lila brought it up she's like let's just look at the month when they stopped going up we
(2:25:29) looked at that month and we looked at what had happened the only change that had happened was that we had hired a new head we added someone to do the job and by adding this bad person they destroyed the function and like sometimes it's a house sometime sometimes you change your process and sometimes that's the culprit but a lot of times you added someone who actively is destroying your business so another big lesson of this year was around content and so I made this video called back to business I don't think it was called that was basically we did this experiment for 16 weeks where we made
(2:26:03) very very wide content so like you know meals and workouts and Vlogs and things like that where we wanted to see okay well if we get more views then maybe a percentage of those people will be business owners and so we our relative amount will go down that are business owners but our absolute amount will go up and so that's all I care about is the absolute amount and so it turns out that that hypothesis was wrong at least for us and so when we made wider content we had fewer absolute amount of business
(2:26:31) owners who were opting in who were who were buying the books and so for me Book Sales is actually a very leading indicator for the people who we want coming towards acquisition. comom and so uh and email options on the site that's a big one by the way if you're not subscribed to mosy uh mosy money minute it's one of the best things that I put out there it takes a minute and I deliver two every week that are extremely tactical things that you can immediately use to make more money like very tactical what of the best things I put out there so I think you go to acis.com
(2:27:01) newsletter and it's there so you can opt in grab that I I think you will like it it's very good I put a lot of time into it okay back to business so in finding that out we shifted our content indeed back to business and lo and behold we got more business owners crazy but I think this is important because a lot of us fall into this wide views vanity trap and so being clear about why you're why you're making content to begin with is important if you're a business owner and you're making content because you want to make more money then you need to stay
(2:27:34) on point serve the Avatar you serve and that has served us very well especially in the longest forms content I think the shorter stuff you can get away with what I would consider adjacent if you're a salon lady and you sell haircuts I know I'm butchering this but you get the idea then if you talk about beauty in general you will probably attract the type of Avatar who spends money on these types of things and so I see that as okay but if you're going to do a long video probably don't do it on makeup tutorials if you sell haircuts get the drift so
(2:28:04) another big part of this is that the structure of the content for entertainment is not the same as uh as education and so with education a lot of the effort is in the pre-production with ENT entainment a lot of the effort goes into post- production there's obviously pre as well but the post production there's just God like think about making the Transformers movie how much post-production is there in that movie a ton right whereas some of the top education videos on the internet are just a dude with a whiteboard which just goes down to the
(2:28:38) quality and the Simplicity of the content itself and so you can make something significantly more compelling by making the language more readily accessible to your avatar now two compon to this one is the examples that you use you want it to be as relevant to the Avatar as possible if I'm talking to uh you know a bunch of mechanics then I'll probably make a car analogy if I want to talk to a bunch of ladies I might use a cooking analogy right and that's with traditional gender roles and stereotypes deal with it all right and so the idea
(2:29:09) here is I will try and speak in a way that I think has the highest likelihood of being language that will be comprehended by the widest slice of my target audience now if you have an even broader audience then you would limit the amount of analogies to things that everyone understands so probably be human things so I might be talking about just eating in general sleeping in general brushing your teeth in general would be the analogies that I would use and the grade language of my speech would be as low as humanly possible so I looked at this politics thing this was before this election but they had shown
(2:29:43) that the politician that spoke at the lowest grade level won every election now I don't know if that's held true since then but I thought it was relatively telling with all of these different marketing strategies the one that mattered most was actually being understood which leads into one of the biggest next things that we did which was I'll put pre versus post here uh which for us because we're education we are focusing more on pre-production this video right now we prepared for hours like what are all the lessons I have
(2:30:12) what are the examples I want to talk about like this isn't me just turning on the camera and saying like what's up I actually put a lot into this and because I it was a whole year it was also helpful for me CU I like to crystallize my own knowledge but prsus post and then another one is is clear packaging right is just be very clear about what it is your content is about and what they're going to get from it and so from that we came up with the three PS which is proof promise plan and so every introduction of every video has to have these three
(2:30:43) things now it doesn't have to but we found that when we included those things those videos did better and so you notice every video since this back to business theme we have proof promise plant within the first call it 30 seconds and so it's what are you going to get from the video why should you believe me and this is how we're going to do it and so in this video I started with we have these three companies uh you know three of our companies are over 100 million we sked a lot this year we went from you know 50 million in eida to just under 100 you will learn the
(2:31:06) lessons from this so you can apply to your business and the plan that we're going to do it is I'm going to walk through them step by step all right there we go right very straightforward and the last piece which was a small one which I actually got pushed back from my team on which is why I'm sharing it with you is introduce yourself right so a lot of people are like oh we don't want to introduce like my audience knows who we are well good thing you're not just making it for them you're making it for people who don't know who you are yet right and so what we did is that we've actually now Consolidated
(2:31:31) this to lower third and so at the beginning of this video you should see you know Alex rosi manage your partner acquisition. comom so we actually able to cut that out of me saying it because we wanted to keep the intros really tight but if no one knows who you are I also have taken out the uh hey if you don't know who I am just say I'm Alex I'm the managing partner of ais.
(2:31:56) com this is what we do or put it lower third and then just skip forward right you you want to keep it as tight as humanely possible and when we look back at the videos that did exceptionally well these were the things that these were our common themes we put more in Pre we introduced ourselves we made it very clear packaging we had a prooved promise plan that was laid out we had examples that were clear and relevant to our Avatar which is business owners and so we made content about business and lo and behold it has been good and on a personal note I prefer making business content to not business content I like resented I'll be really real with you I I was so H I was afraid of the results
(2:32:25) that were going to come in cuz I was like if I'm going to have to make Meal videos I'm going to kill myself I just like I like like then we'll do our workouts next I'm like no I'll just I'll just be dead it won't matter like it doesn't matter I'll just die and so and so like I'm sure from like the thing is is that I have a relatively High pain Toler so like if it was the way to win I would like if you were like hey if you hit your hand with this Hammer your business will keep growing like my hand my hand would be a pancake right I would
(2:32:48) just keep going at it but I I would prefer not to do it that way and I'm very grateful that you guys like business concept better because that's what I like making too so the next one is around platforms and I think this was really interesting so I looked really deeply at the platforms from this last year and so I made a whole tier list video about this so I'm not going to go in super depth on this but I would say that the uh MVP of the year was email or maybe most improved if you want to call it that way I have not traditionally spent a long time on email which seems
(2:33:18) ridiculous cuz written word is my best format duh and so I started writing emails and they started doing well duh like maybe I should hate money less I don't know anyways so email was kind of the MVP of the year for me probably the the like the most improved like didn't expect it the feedback I've gotten has been exceptional and I made also a separate video on how I just write my emails and so you can watch that I'm sure it'll be I'm sure you can find it all right beyond that though Facebook was a uh in terms of like book sales per
(2:33:47) follower count and per view count was kind of like the highest leverage like we actually got a lot from that so we're investing more in Facebook right now The Perennial Champs were IG and YouTube uh in terms of percentage of traffic that came to acquisition.
(2:34:06) comom YouTube Instagram were by far the biggest ones the unbeknownst one was books this is one that no one talks about but Amazon is actually responsible for like 15% of my traffic uh which is kind of cool meaning basically the amount of people who buy books and then read the books and then go to the site a huge percentage of my traffic indirectly comes from Amazon because they because my books do really well and have a lot of reviews and and Amazon wants to have people buy products that they like on Amazon because then they associate the good things from that product with Amazon ha right it's like they have a
(2:34:30) strategy and I also said in my tier list video that Tik Tok was something that I uh was deprioritizing and I thought more about that since that video so it's been like seven months I think since I made that video I think that it's not that Tik Tok is not a good platform for business I think that we had a skill Gap around Tik Tok and so I'm actively trying to remedy that right now and bringing in some amazing people I'm from the Tik Tok side it's a platform I don't know very well and so we are going to
(2:34:54) just bring in great people and in line their incentives and see what happens but fundamentally I know there are business owners on Tik Tok I just haven't been able to package my content in a way that did well on that platform but if you're curious since we made the incentive change our Tik Tok is up 300% this week so you know incentives work and speaking of those platforms I would recommend checking out my email I did say it earlier uh MIM moneyy minute I put a lot of time into them I think they're really good uh if you like my books you love the emails it's like like
(2:35:25) super super distilled down that really proud of them it just it's just worked out really well and so I think um I think you will like them uh it's acis.com newletter and by the way if you haven't read the books for the love of God it's the best stuff I have so like if you like my videos you will like the books more straight up you'll like them more they're better and I feel like I can say that objectively like I work on both of them and I think that and it's just fundamentally it's because I haven't spent 2,000 hours on a video I have SP $2,000 on a book so $100 million offers $100 million reads check them out
(2:35:54) if this was valuable for you it would mean the world to me if you shared it with another entrepreneur or people inside of your team it's the only thing that encourages me to keep doing this as I shout into the dark abyss share it on your stories text it to friends it it it would mean a lot I don't have sponsors for this thing and so that is my only ask otherwise stay awesome

(00:00) what's going on everyone today i want to talk about what it's like to live as the ultra wealthy and so hi my name is alex uh owner of allen prestige labs jim launch a number of other portfolio companies who did 120 plus million in the last uh four years and growing and i've learned a lot of lessons and i want to share some of those with you and so one of the things is kind of understanding how the ultra wealthy live and i want to talk about some stuff that no one no one i feel like no one talks about and it's something my dad used to tell
(00:27) me when i was growing up he said never be impressed by money and he used to say that so many times when i was growing up and i like i didn't really get it as much but he was so big on it i was like hey look at that guy he's so rich and he was just like don't be impressed by money and it's it's really kind of stuck with me and so what i want to do is kind of show you some transparent things so that you can hopefully not be impressed by money so it's really easy to look ultra wealthy all right so i'm going to show you some
(00:54) of the things that you see on instagram um and some of the things that you know you see around and i'm going to break it down for you money-wise so that hopefully it stops impressing you all right so we're going to talk about private jets we're going to talk about you know what i'll do and at the end i'll tell you which one i think is worth it all right so yeah private jets let's say you've got an exotic car okay let's say uh what else you probably want a penthouse right want a penthouse what what else do we have on our
(01:22) on our dreams list all right we got penthouse let's say you want really nice clothes right you want like really expensive you know expensive clothes all right and then let's say fancy restaurants all right sweet let's let's walk through it so this comes down to like if you're like man i really you know my dream lifestyle and i think this is a useful exercise for anyone to go through if you haven't already to find this stuff but let's say that you travel six times a year so every two months all right you go somewhere there and back average
(01:56) travel at least in the us is gonna be two hours so if you two hour flight six times a year all right it's there and back with just four hours four hours of flying six times a year total just 24 hours all right that's 24 hours the reason i'm defining this by hours is because private jets uh get price per hour and if you're curious how much it costs if you go through a service you can usually get it for about four thousand dollars an hour okay so people don't know this that's how much it costs all right so that's about a hundred thousand dollars
(02:24) a year wait flying private 100 000 a year i thought it was you had to be a super duper millionaire no not really um it's 100 grand a year now do i think that's really expensive for flights when the alternative to that is for for for six flights could be uh you know maybe you know if you did first class you'd be maybe spending six grand you know at worst if you did it last minute you'd spend like 10 grand so 10 times the price for an alternative well that's the alternative price all right consider it the next one
(02:56) exotic cars all right so i'll give you a range here but you can pretty much get a really nice car for a thousand dollars a month like a very very very nice car if you want like a rolls-royce you know one of the most expensive cars anywhere and you're releasing it you would spend you know 4 500 months you know 4 500 bucks a month all right so that's 4 000 a month which is about 50 000 a year right all right next one penthouse so if you this kind of depends on like unless you're in a major city but if you're not in a major city which
(03:29) is what most of the the ig influencers will try and influence you with um you can get a really nice place for five thousand dollars a month in just about every market that's not new york you know la you know it's like maybe miami and sometimes even the nice place my name is like 10 grand a month right but you know what let's let's level up let's let's live a little bit so we'll say 10 000 a month all right really really really nice place all right so that's 120k a year all right and then finally expensive clothes
(04:00) believe it or not are some of the cheapest things that are out there because i mean you buy your gucci belt which is 500 bucks you buy your your gucci shoes which are another 600 bucks and then you know you want to buy a handful 100 t-shirts okay so i mean you're spending what like 3 000 a year you know on clothes which is not nearly as much as you'd think right and then fancy restaurants let's say you go out to date night once a week and you drop 400 on a really nice dinner really really nice dinner i'm trying we're living it
(04:33) up here right so it's 600 bucks a month times 12. i don't want to do the math there let's say it's 20k all right so this lifestyle and this is the this is the i mean we're talking the ultra ultra ultra wealthy lifestyle this isn't just like um i'm a millionaire this is like i'm a super duper wealthy person right i mean look at all this stuff we've got we've got lamborghinis pen houses we're only wearing uh you know designer clothes we've we travel with private jets we go to fancy restaurants we do all of that stuff how much does it actually cost
(05:03) right it costs 100 grand 150 270 about 300 grand a year all right 300 grand a year so that's that's it that's the dream number and i have so many people were like i need to make a zillion dollars right well after taxes you need to make 300 grand so you're looking at 500 ish 1000 a year 550 is what you need to make and that is a top that's top one percent but this is so stupid um as someone who literally has done all of these things uh let me let me give you some insight into some of the stuff that i've discovered
(05:50) one flying private is actually really nice but it's it's wildly expensive and i still feel guilty for it exotic car definitely not worth it i have two and like i they're so not worth it at all like seriously not worth it at all the incremental enjoyment that i get compared to driving like a an old prius or a pickup truck is is inconsequential if anything you get used to it within like a week or two and honestly the only reason i got this is because i was on a podcast with brad lee if you guys know him and he was like dude you're so cheap
(06:25) he's like just go you know like just get the car because my wife and i split a car until not that long ago and he was like dude you make so much money just go get the darn car so i was like all right i won't be a cheap ass and so i got the car and now i totally regret it but you know it is what it is so hopefully you can learn from that mistake that being said what i'm gonna do is also i'll walk through percentage of income like for perspective if i can do this all of this stuff off of one week's income it what do you do the next week right
(06:55) and so that's why increasing your income is so important because all of this stuff's actually really easy to achieve um and so that's why i don't think you should be like taking huge advice from people because get you know getting a business to do you know 80 000 a month and you know taking home 40 pretty much just affords you this lifestyle that's it like now mind you knock out private jet flying and you know make a reasonable penthouse instead of a ten thousand dollar a month penthouse which is is a really nice place right then just
(07:23) like that we took out half the cost of this lifestyle so now we're down to 150 000 right it's like okay well then i could still look like a super and i still have my exotic car still have expensive clothes still eat at fancy restaurants and that's on 150 grand a year right and so my my biggest takeaways here are or that i that i hope people take away is like the people who have the most money honestly all of this stuff is a very very small percentage of their income and so don't let this be the reason that you listen to someone because
(07:55) there are people who live like this and that's 100 of their income and those are people you should not listen to for advice on money right like in my opinion the only reason you should ever get to this part is is when you're you know it's you're living this is this is less than 10 of what you make that's my that's my opinion less than ten percent of what you make you save ninety percent all right and so overall the that that's my that's my big message is that i have i have done all of these things i am not currently wearing fancy clothes
(08:24) i'm wearing jean shorts and a t-shirt that my aunt gave me for christmas fancy restaurants this is something that i do with layla and i actually feel like i get a good return on our date night but not on the fact that it's a fancy restaurant i enjoy applebee's cheesy factory bj's and chili's and chipotle honestly just as much as i enjoy the fancy restaurant i think the value of the fancy restaurant is that you dress up more so than the actual food and experience and i've had the 500 steaks and all that stuff and honestly like a
(08:57) really good double meat chipotle bowl hard to beat fajitas and chips at chili's hard to beat cheesecake factory cheesecake hard to beat pizookia bjs no one has anything on their desserts right and so what's interesting is that having now done these exotic things especially like cars and experiences you'd be surprised that a lot of times i think the best quality having now tasted all of these things the best quality comes from the stuff that tends to be the biggest mass market because they do the most product testing
(09:26) and so recently i rented a i think i rented a chevy suburban we were traveling somewhere and the interface was so much easier to deal with than my bentley's interface it was so simple i plugged my phone in it worked automatically it was just like it was such a dream compared to this thing that's a 350 000 car because they only make you know a handful of them so they don't have nearly the product testing and they put all these gizmos in it that are impossible to figure out how to use and so don't don't be don't be persuaded
(09:56) by this stuff all right try this is just my two cents you can take whatever you want from it but this has just been my experience with all of these things restaurants i like that the the cheaper ones better expensive clothes i clothes i get nothing from so personally i think i have some shirts that are awesome but the mass majority of them are less than 30 the penthouse thing i don't think you should spend a lot of money on where you live personally i think if you look at your primary residence as an investment if
(10:23) you can and live in something that would be an investment income uh type property then i think it makes sense like the places that really make sense is like if you can live in a duplex and run out the other spot you live for free and you're gonna pre you're appreciating the assets you have that stuff makes a lot of sense to me and you have to pick figure out what your trade-offs are but if this is the absolute ultra wealthy you know uh a lifestyle do you know what ultra ultra wealthy is because i'll tell you what it is right
(10:49) now it's 30 million or more 30 million to a billion in investable assets well if you have 30 million dollars in investable assets that's the bottom range of alternate high net worth then if you're gaining even 10 a year you're making 3 million a year right on your money just your money making money and so just your passive income is 10 times greater than what it costs to live this way and so in that instance it kind of makes sense right or it's like if you want to do it do it but i'll tell you this of the people
(11:19) that i know were ultra wealthy not kind of wealthy not high net worth which is 5 to 30 or just um or millionaire right which is one to five the people who have that stuff uh who are the highest that i know almost all of them i've had these conversations with them have come to the same conclusion which is almost none of this stuff is worth it and so you get there you try the fruit and you realize this is just not worth it so if i can hopefully save somebody a couple hundred grand who does get there then try and avoid
(11:46) this stuff that's that's my two cents so that's what that's what i have for you if you've if you never experienced this stuff or don't know how much it cost this is how much this stuff costs in the real world i do think you should spend less than if you can uh less than 10 of what you make because if you can spend less than 10 what you make then it means that honestly within two to five years you can live completely free of anything because your wealth is a ratio between your expenses and your income it is not a
(12:15) number that's the thing everyone messes up it's an expense it's a ratio of income to expenses that is what wealth is and so if your income to expense ratio is ten to one you are very wealthy so whether you live on thirty thousand dollars a year and you make three hundred thousand a year that is a very wealthy person they're extremely extremely well set up they have no stress because they have so much more than they need and so that's what i think the key comes down to is having so much more than you need and the happiness equation if you guys don't
(12:43) know what it actually is it's not uh when i get x i will be happy that's uh that's not the right one the right one is haves over once and if you can get your wants to zero then it doesn't matter what you have on top equals infinity and so as much as everyone likes to chase the the top number to compensate for the fact that they want these things if you can simply decrease the desire you will increase the abundance in your life and by extension your your income to expense ratio which is what will build your wealth and give you the freedom you
(13:20) want so anyways this has been a little experience of mine that i hope you find valuable and hopefully you don't have to make some of these lovely mistakes that i have keeping awesome lots of love i'll catch you guys soon bye

Transcript:
(00:00) I started and sold a software company started and sold a gym licensing business started and sold a suban company and six other businesses over the last 13 years the vast majority of businesses that I talk to the entrepreneurs think they're in one business but they're actually in another by only being able to solve one set of problems they continue to jump from business to business to business rather than realize that there's one big problem the business they're actually in that unlocks all the Enterprise Value
(00:24) that gets into the next level but if you want to make a big business you want to build an asset that to make you generationally wealthy this is for you I have made the mistake in almost every business that I've been in in thinking I was getting into one business when in reality I was getting into a very different business and discovering the real business that you're actually in is what will unlock the amount of growth and money-making that you really want to get into It's usually the second and third level of Entrepreneurship within
(00:50) whatever opportunity vehicle you're pursuing so let me give you example to kind of make this real when I got into the gym business I liked Fitness and so I thought that the business was going to be about like macros and results and workouts and all of that that's what I thought the business was going to be about uh but once I got into the business I realized it was actually just about marketing and sales that specific business is about marketing and sales overall now when I make these generalizations all businesses are like
(01:19) cars like if you don't have wheels the car is not going to move if you don't gas the car is not going to move if you don't have an engine the car is not going to move but the question is what is the biggest limit or what's the biggest thing that gives you the most return in that specific vehicle or that specific business and so I'm going to walk you through four or five different businesses that I've been what I thought it was versus what it really was and then I'll turn it back to you and thinking about how you can apply that
(01:41) same methodology and I'll bet you many of you and I get this because I have a lot of conversations with business owners today they don't know what business they're really in all right so I thought it was about Fitness but it was actually about sales and marketing if you look at the biggest Fitness companies in the world like especially in the gym space they acquisition machines that's what they are very very good at the actual fitness component of it is actually pretty minor right and I mean I'll tell you this from talking to
(02:07) the franchisors who in many many many locations or privately owned ones have thousand plus locations that the fitness stuff is almost an afterthought they're like yeah yeah yeah get people to sweat move around whatever because the reality is that within Fitness for example the biggest problem is that people don't show up because of other reasons and so you have to always go get more customers the good news is is that everyone's trying to lose weight three times a year and so there are plenty of people so that was the first business that I
(02:32) misunderstood what business I was really in now thankfully quickly I learned that and then that became the skill set that I you know doubled down on now with that I then was like okay well I'm going to start a sub company which which with Prestige Labs now again I thought that business was going to be all about the product I thought it was all going to be about the stuff that's inside of it and so I got Dr cashy my good friend who's bi he's a PhD biochemist one of the smartest human beings on Earth and I said hey man can you make the best
(02:58) products I said make a sandwich you would actually eat because he he made all these o things for Olympians and he would put together these trash bags full of like specific ingredients and specific compounds and he's like dude these are going to be way too expensive like it's not going to be commercially viable based on the quality of the ingredients and I was like dude just make the best product I'll figure out how to sell it and so um that's that was the focus that I had in Prestige lives but guess what once I got into that
(03:22) business I realized that it actually had very little to do with what was in the bottle because basically anything anything that's in a bottle that you don't taste the inside the vast majority of products that are out there benefit off of plus sibo and no sibo effect basically people taking something and then they feel better because they take something and I want to be I want to be clear Placebo effects a real effect so like I'm about the effect whatever works for you works for you and that's not really the point of this talk but more
(03:47) so that I got into the business thinking that what was inside the bottle was the thing that mattered but the reality was what was on the outside of thing the bottle and the thing that the bottle was next to meaning it became what I realized almost too late was that it's it's a business that's based on on brand it's based on branding and it's based on media in terms of having tons and tons of traffic and so I thought I was building a product based company that was going to be based on what's inside the bottle when everything that was
(04:12) limiting the business what was on the outside of the bottle and I saw the guys who are the biggest in the space and this is the little Telltale sign by the way if you want to hack this is you look at the people who are the biggest in your space so take your model take it to its natural extreme and look and I think there's a lot of wisdom that can be found from that and trying to reverse engineer like what are the things that make this different now you might be like and here's this is what I used to do all right so like don't make this
(04:32) mistake when I was in the gym industry I would look like when I started I was like oh my God I can make way better workouts than those guys that's because those guys don't give a [ __ ] about their workouts because that's not the main thing in the business I got into the sub business like oh my God I like these guys are making hundreds of millions of dollars on this product that's just mediocre like the thing is is that most of the customers that are buying it don't even know the difference anyways which means that your differentiator
(04:54) isn't actually making you different you're the only one who knows your differentiator which is not good your customer has realize what the differentiator is and so the thing is is that for most supplements the differentiator is LeBron takes it or so and so takes it or I think this is cool or my friend Sally likes it right or and I'll be clear on a consumables perspective if it has a flavor then the flavor becomes very important in the long run in terms of how good it tastes because most people take ag1 because
(05:20) they think it tastes good and because they feel good about it not because what's inside of it all right so just to be clear I got into the gym business and I thought it was about Fitness but is really about marketing and sales I got in in into Prestige Labs of sub business and I thought it was about the stuff inside the bottom when really about brand and building a big media traffic machine and then I was like okay I think I'm getting the hang of this of just making mistakes over and over again so then I got into the software business
(05:41) and I was like okay I get it everything is about marketing and sales I'll be able to sell the [ __ ] out of this and guess what we sure as hell could because I knew how to Market and sell and so then I got into the software software business and I realized by the way side note software tends to sell itself you know why because if you can have technology and say hey there's that thing that you're doing that this will do automat atically not a very hard pitch but the problem with software is actually delivering on the promise and
(06:06) so it actually is a very product driven business because anyone can sell it the constraint like software is not that difficult to sell at least this is my experience with this all right so take that with my big Himalayan size gra of salt for me that's when I realized that product was the main thing and guess what I don't when I started out I outsourced the product I had an Outsource Dev team make the product for me which I then realized was the core part of the business it's like starting a s company then try to have an agency
(06:31) build your sub company for you if you're in the sub business or you're in the consumer product goods business Outsourcing acquisition Outsourcing brand Outsourcing media is like it's it's that's the business like that's the business you're in it's not the stuff inside the bottle all right so I'll give you another one so I had a gym owner uh friend of mine from many many years ago he was in he was in he he became a Gard he was a ly awesome guy and he started um he had a couple locations and his wife started a
(07:02) cleaning business because they got into airbnbs because you started making money in the gym so you started investing and he realized he actually liked real estate better than you lik the gyms which is awesome great um and so they started a cleaning company to uh clean houses for the airbnbs but then they realized they got in the Airbnb community and they also got in just like that area and they're like you know what we could probably just sell cleaning to other people and so this was interesting I had dinner with him and he was saying
(07:24) I was like so what's your LTV to CAC he's like oh dude cac's like $25 and I was like what he's like oh getting customers in cleaning not a problem and this is and he was like this is so different from the gym business because the gym business getting the customers getting have to arm wrestle suie for an hour to get her to say yeah she's going to stop eating crap and start coming to the gym three times a week but if you just say hey I'm going to clean your stuff and you don't have to do anything not a very hard sale and so he said the
(07:49) real problem that I'm having right now is actually getting people to do the cleaning right is actually getting hot you know people who speak English who don't steal who show up on time and do all that and like do a good job consistently he the problem that's actually the problem of the business and so I had this it was this great moment for me because I love seeing finding found finding out what is the real business behind the business and so if you're in the cleaning business you're not in the cleaning business you're in
(08:14) the recruiting and training business you have to learn how to get low skill labor in high volume to show up for you consistently which is a cultural thing it's a training thing and part of that has to do with brand but a lot of it is just having the incentive system structured such that that type of person can still succeed and he had a cool little thing that he did he did he had a setup where they got paid not by hour but by clean and so they were actually incentivized and so basically and this by the way big Pro tip on business is
(08:45) you want to have paired incentives so it's like having quality and speed and so it's like if you have a customer support team you want to measure them not just on like percentage of tickets that are absolutely resolved you also want to have speed of completion if you only have one then you have lots of people responding as quickly as possible but not getting it done and on the flip side if you just do on rather the ticket is completely resolved people won't move fast enough and so it's having paired metrics um Andy gr talks about this in
(09:11) high output management really good book If you ever like want to learn more about Ops pretty high level though just to be really honest with you but it's a great book any and so the paired meure for him was you get you can clean as many houses as you can in a day and I pay you per clean and so that drove up his productivity per employee and so the paired metric was that if you don't do a good job you have to go back and do it again at no cost and so that was the deal and that was also part of his offer for the cleaning thing and it worked
(09:38) really great and so like if you don't think we do a good job we'll come back and clean your whole house again and we'll do it for free and so that was the paired metric again so he thought he was getting the acquisition business he's like dude I can get customers all day long in this business and he it's because he came from the gym world and expected it to be the same and so I've noticed this is this continued thing is that what I think I'm getting into is actually not the real constraint of the business and I'm going to I want to Leap
(10:00) Frog ahead here but like this is a little bit of foreshadowing for the woman in the red dress all right so I'll just I'll just leave that there all right so I'll give you one for the anybody who's in like the Consulting space or Professional Services space if you sell to businesses you sell how to Market how to I mean even accounting you sell lawyer stuff you do Consulting in general any of that stuff you think that you're in the marketing and sales business because that's what people will tell you right but if you really want to
(10:23) play this game at a high level now again it's a car if you have no Marketing sales you're not going to have a business right duh but which is these things is the thing that unlocks the biggest level of growth is actually again look at the biggest companies in the space you look at ey eron young you look at KPMG you look at you look at uh McKenzie you look at Bane you look at BCG these big public massive firms multi-billion dollar hundred billion dollar companies what is what is the thing what is the business they're
(10:49) really in they're in the recruiting business as well and specifically the talent management business because different than the cleaning business now structurally it's recruiting for sure but it's at a completely different level they're trying to skim the cream of the crop because how do you scale expertise their Intelligence on demand if you go to the bet you go to pulson you go to some big big Law Firm right in Manhattan right some big law firm with a Manhattan address they have to attract the absolute best and brightest people
(11:19) otherwise the brand will degrade over time but how do you attract the best and brightest people well that's why a lot of these Professional Services businesses are based on Partnerships they're limited Partnerships they're llps all right and so it's because anybody they have a track for eventually becoming an owner in the business and most service-based businesses that rely on expertise have tracks for people to have small slices of ownership and they're willing to have a small slice of a $200 billion pie rather than start out on
(11:44) their own and they also have sub Specialties underneath of that you're a IP lawyer you're a you're a you know defense lawyer whatever they' have all these different you know subtracks underneath of that and so again you get into the Consulting business and people say hey it's about marketing and sales but really if you want to scale and and again this is the thing if you want to scale if you just want to make money then sure just market and sell and and you can make a buck right that's not the problem but if you want to get big you
(12:08) want to build an asset the business you get in there is on talent and how do you retain talent and how do you improve the value of that talent and make them look because otherwise what do you do what what happens if you do a great job with talent in that business but you don't retain them they take up they take your customers and they leave they start their own shop they hang their own shindle up that's that's the game there right so the G the the figure what you have to figure fure out this is the big billion dollar problem is what you have
(12:32) to do all right now um I I I'll leave it at that because I think I made the point now here here's why this is important is that if you know the business that you're really in you actually can get paid to solve the right problem all right now the way that I like to think about this is that like as entrepreneurs we get paid to solve problems and the bigger the problem the bigger the payoff and so I like to imagine it like I've got I've got this big massive wall in front of me and the thing is is I see the wall but I don't know how thick it
(12:58) is but I but I have an idea that it's pretty thick right cuz I'm like shoot I don't know I'm going to get through this wall but I like to mentally envision myself that there's this big pile of money on the other side and I remember having this conversation with a portfolio company we're like hey we think that we need to build software into this business and actually transform this business from a media company into a software company and it's like this is a big strategic bet like lot of resources a lot of time basically
(13:21) a lot of like lost growth like instead of us gassing it on this side we're actually going to basically maintain here and then deploy a lot of resources into growing software Ware and so I was talking to the founder he was like this is really hard this is going to be really really hard for us to do and I was like yeah yeah it's going to be really hard I said but um if we solve it we get an extra $250 million so does that feel worth it and he was like well when you say it like that and I was like right so for 250 million bucks would I
(13:53) solve it yeah it feels it feels a lot more uh approachable or at least it feels worth it and so I'd encourage you to think like what is the ultimate price tag of me solving this problem worth and then all of a sudden you're like okay then you can actually appropriately allocate your personal resources to solving the problem because it really will make you a lot of money now um a lot of times we need to frame the problem for what we get by solving it otherwise we avoid solving it um and so knowing the business that you're really
(14:23) in isn't really what you think it is it's often the second or third order effect and that's the big wall and so you come in like my friend did he starts acquiring customers he's like I'm going to make so much money here and he's like oh shoot I got to hire in staff people boom he sees this big wall and he's like oh I'm not equipped to solve this problem and this here it is this is the meat this is the part that I've been waiting to get you and Hammer you guys on is hey and if you'd like to get personalized advice on how to scale your
(14:52) business and unlock the Enterprise Value kind of like the stuff that we're talking about here today acquisition. comom just started its new workshop division uh where we we host one or two days a month uh at our headquarters here in Vegas for businesses that we're not necessarily invested in nor do you have to become a portfolio company but it's a way for us to meet more companies for you to meet us for us to help you solve some problems unlock some big value if that sounds a little interesting go to acquisition. comom hit the scaling
(15:15) button and our team will see if you qualify hope to see you soon the woman in the red dress appears now as soon as you realize the business you're really in and you also realize that you're not equipped to solve it because you don't know what the hell you're doing and you don't know what you got into to begin with that is when the woman in the red dress appears now if you don't know if you're not familiar with my stuff the woman of the red dress is any shiny object it's the distraction and the interesting thing about the woman of the
(15:42) red dress is that the better you get at business the hotter she is and so like you think you can you learn to say no to a two out of 10 yeah because you've got some crackhead lady on the side of the street it's like okay she's like hey let's go home and you're like I'm good I'd rather just not get chlamydia whatever you've got right um and so all businesses have [ __ ] they all have [ __ ] they all have a big brick wall that you have to come in contact with and guess what that's why you get paid to solve the [ __ ] problem that's why you make
(16:09) outsized returns is because you have to be willing to confront with the sledgehammer in hand not knowing how thick the wall is going to be and start hammering away at it with the hope that when you get to the other side it will have been worth it and often it is now I want to I want to drive this point home so if you have a roofing business if you have a restaurant business if you have a dry clean cleaning business all you have to do is look at the world and see is there any version of this business that is a billion dollar company or even a
(16:36) hundred million dollar company whatever your goals are and most times you'll find that there is that but you'll also find that it just takes time to get there because the ount times I have let's let's say small business own this actually happens a lot right is hey I've got a I've got a a roofing contracting business okay cool and they say hey should I jump into a different opportunity vehicle I'm like okay what are you doing they're like I'm doing 4 million Top Line I'm doing a million bucks in bottom line okay okay okay well
(17:00) why why don't you just 10x the size of your company ah and then they say well I've got this big concrete wall in front of me right what they describe next is the real problem of that business the business that they're really in that they didn't know they were getting into and I want to be clear this only happens at scale all right so once like all businesses like if you're if you're if if you're new to entrepreneurship you got to figure out the basics of everything you got to figure out that a wheel is round you got to make sure that
(17:27) gasoline is combustible you got to make sure that there's some sort of engine it might be a sewing machine in the beginning that's that's powering your car it might be a remote control car that that can only go you know 10 miles an hour but like there's got to be some engine otherwise you're not going to get any movement right but when you start really wanting to achieve scale there's going to be a big hairy problem there's going to be a big concrete wall in front of you that you don't know how thick it is and that is the work that is where the
(17:51) Enterprise Value is unlocked and the vast majority of the time when we're investing in a company or we take over a company we are just comfortable with the fact that there's a concrete wall and we're just going to chip away at it and so a lot of the work that I do is actually expectation management with the team is saying yeah this is going to take two years yeah this will take three years and they're like wait three years I'm like yeah well I'm in this F like I mean let me put it this way if in five years we had $100 million Enterprise to
(18:17) this business is it worth it they're like well yeah I'm like do you think we can solve it in five years I'm like well yeah but then guess what they don't do be willing to wait 5 years and so the thing is is that sometimes it takes somebody from the outside say like dude let's Zoom all the way out if you solve this for 10000 million bucks is it worth it yeah okay well it's going to take that long oh huh and then things start to settle and then you get this you get less frenetic energy the amount of wasted effort for entrepreneurs that
(18:43) goes into this ideation of what else they could be doing with their time or with their skill sets honestly it's it's like oh great analogy it's like it's like being single versus being married all right hear me out is that when you're single at least for me when I was guy I would say 30% of my time was or I'm being generous maybe 40% of my time might have been higher anyways I'm not going to into it was allocated to like the idea of chasing tail so it was like man what if what if that worked out what if that worked out and I'm I'm I'm I'm
(19:12) spinning multiple plates I'm I'm doing lead nurture right I'm working the pipeline I'm planting seeds I'm I'm making a a quippy comment I'm responding to a story whatever and so I'm working leads and so as I was doing this right all my attention was going to possibility was to potential was to what if right as soon as I got married the thing the biggest gift that marriage got me was it got me 30 to 40% of my time back was I didn't have to think about this like this part of my life was not done but like solved as in like I'm
(19:43) goingon to be with Ila cool great now all the extra tension that used to go to like possibility in terms of what who of who else could be goes back into the main thing which for me was business now within the business it works the same way is that I think most of you guys are dating your business but you need to get married to your business you guys are trying to have friends with benefits with your business trying to go on dates maybe date a couple other business on the side have some side chicks and then you're wondering why your relationship
(20:10) with your business isn't that healthy if you go all in on the business the business will go all in on you and I promise you it's just that the guy who's beating you right now he's just committed he's just married he's just married to the business he's like I'm I mean if it takes me 5 years it takes me 5 years but like where am I going like I'm in this I'm in it for the long and he sees what the value of a 30-year marriage would be or a 50-year marriage would be with his business and so if you know the business you're really in which
(20:40) you usually find out a couple years into the business which is once you solve the basics of business you realize oh this is the big hairy problem and then you don't know how long it will last but I promise you that someone else has solved it and I promise you that they weren't super Geniuses they just were willing to commit they were willing to to swing the hammer at the wall for a very long period of time and willing to zoom out and say I can think in fiveyear in commence and do I think that if I put everything I have and not get distracted
(21:06) with the woman in the red dress not have the side chick not have these these other businesses I'm flirting with that I'm keeping warm on the side these networking lunches for this guy I might do a partnership with even though it has nothing to do with this business because he says hey you're good at this I'm good at this we could do this thing together none of that and just being like no I'm just I'm just going to keep slamming at this wall because if if I just get this one thing right if I just break through
(21:30) this wall I will unlock all of the wealth that I've ever wanted but there is a big thick massive gray boring wall between there and where you want to go and it's just who's willing to keep swinging the hammer for a long period of time without getting distracted and without thinking they're smarter than they are keep being awesome [ __ ] slay love you all bye

Transcript:
(00:00) the holidays are upon us and most businesses make more money in the last month of the year than they do any other month if you own a business or you work for a business this is your opportunity to capitalize and every one of these presents I'm going to open up and give you one holiday money making tactic that you can take to the bank starting with this one so let's open this guy up what do we have inside we've got diapers and we've got baby bottles now what do these have to do with making money inside of diapers and the baby
(00:32) bottles is actually one of the strongest concepts for Holiday marketing which is something called a loss leader so what is a loss leader a loss leader is basically where you sell a very well understood product and you sell it for less than the market understands the prices for so you sell it at a loss now why would it be called a loss leader the leader part of it is that it brings people in the door most people know that if you have a baby you got to buy diapers the highest percentage of the population you have babies buy diapers
(00:58) they all need diapers sell the thing that most of of them understand what the price is for that almost all customers will buy so that you can bring them in the door because if you have the cheapest diapers they're going to come buy diapers from you now what they might not know the prices for are all the ancillary purchases they might make once they come into your store whether that's a digital store or a physical brick and mortar store like these non-rip bottles might have insane margins in markup compared to the diapers and so trying to
(01:23) make quarter or two quarters more on the diapers compared to making dollars on the baby bottles is where you can make up what you lost here but you make it up in significantly more profit and total unit sold how do you use this for a Black Friday or a holiday promotion what you want to do is you want to look at your product stack there you go this is why I use an iPad so if I have my services and so there's different components to my services like for example and I use Fitness a lot you have access to a facility that's a component
(01:51) you also have accountability which is another component the actual workouts or service with a trainer you could also have nutrition meal prepping eating out guides alcohol guide for the holidays so there's lots of components to whatever it is that you sell whether it's services or products many people sell something like this as a bundle and there's nothing wrong with that makes it harder for other people to compete with you on price but if you take out one of these pieces let's say this one's accountability I guess and then I say
(02:17) hey I'm going to make this 90% off people going be like holy cow that's a great deal and so what happens is you can promote this 90% off thing which is what a Black Friday or huge holiday promo big bash would be like and you're like well you don't just want accountability right you probably also want some help with your food you probably want some workouts you probably want access to the facility you probably want these other things people like you know what you're right I do kind of need that stuff but the reason they came in
(02:42) doesn't necessarily need to be the way you make money and so that's the big Theory or strategy behind loss lead and I'm pretty sure diapers.com I think was what it was called this was the strategy they actually used to take over the baby Market was they sold them cheaper than everyone else did but they made all the profit up on the other ancillary upsells and so this works for product products it works for services and it even works for technology look at what you have put it into an itemized list of all the
(03:05) things you could potentially Market or advertise and then you peel off one of them I call it splintering your offer and then you make an insane discount around one of those pieces now ideally even if you lose a little bit of money on this you will make it up in the total amount of leads and the reason it's so important in general to have a promotion going on during the holidays is the thing I said at the very beginning most businesses make more money in the last month of the year and that's for two reasons one because they advertise more
(03:29) and two because people want want to spend more so if people are buying during that month then that's when you want to be selling even more all right so that's it with our loss leaders now we have gift number two gift cards what do gift cards have to do with Black Friday and holiday promotions first off gift cards are one of the most lucrative things that you can sell in general did you know that Best Buy has an insanely low Redemption rate so when grandma gets all the kids Best Buy gift cards the percentage of
(03:57) people who actually spend the money is very low but essentially is is a loan that a customer gives to a business and the business just keeps the cash on their balance sheet can earn interest on it while they wait to redeem for it and after a certain point of expiration they can just keep all of the money without even providing Goods unbelievably profitable thing people literally give you money for nothing not a bad idea but how do we use this besides the way Best Buy did to generate leads and I'll show you how so I call this the gift card
(04:22) strategy and this is one that I used all the time my brick and Mort locations you offer $200 gift cards to your services one purchase worth of services so if you give out massages or you have a membership to a facility or you do cleanings it doesn't really matter what it is but one unit's worth you do that dollar amount as a gift card that's number one one full unit in in dollar amounts that's step one the next step is that you Market to your existing customer and you say hey I'm selling this gift cards it's limit
(04:55) two per person step three is you say this is a $200 gift card but I'm selling it for 90% off or 80% off whatever you want I'm going to say 90 cuz I'm going I'm going big here so your $200 gift card is actually 20 bucks which is 90% off remember we're trying to get attention everyone else is doing Black Friday promos and we need to break through the noise and this is a crazy good promotion but here's the catch only as gifts for friends and family so this is the ultimate stocking stuffer you tell your entire client base they
(05:29) can buy two these gifts for other people and they get the credit for it being $200 because it's a gift card so imagine you open put a gift and says $200 on it you're stoked the fact that Grandma went to Alex's gym and she only paid 20 for it you don't know that nor do you really care but this is the genius part of this strategy number one this is an insane promotion so you're going to get a lot of attention and a lot of people are going to want to buy it number two is that you're actually going to get paid money for selling these gift cards but
(05:55) here's the secret all of this is new customers and so what this basically means is that you're going to get paid to get new customers and you would probably give the services away for free anyways to get a customer but rather than marketing and spending money to get someone in the door to try your stuff out you're going to get paid to do it but not only that these are the highest quality customers cuz they're referrals and referrals Buy in higher rates stay in higher rates and because they're coming from somebody else they can
(06:21) usually help assist them in kind of onboarding and figuring out the app if you need to check in for a facility or whatever it is that you sell you get the assist from the friends you can double a client base cuz you can get every single person to bring not one but two and the reason we limited two per customer is cuz it increases the perceived value you could sell two units and make it 70% off two units would be $400 and you give 70% off which would be 60 bucks doesn't matter you're getting paid to get new customers and the highest quality source
(06:45) and so one of the important details to do with this is that when you make the sale ask them who they're going to give it to and get the contact information so not only that you're actually going to get these as lead so if for whatever reason that person doesn't redeem it you can follow up with the lead to bring them in and because you'll have their contact information you can do a three-way intro with the customer who bought it and the prospect but what else can you do with this the gift card was for $200 right well what if everybody
(07:09) who comes in you have a sales console with and you try and sell them all $1,000 thing well now you take that $200 you mark it off and you can turn these into $800 sales and that's the last step of this so big picture one full unit $200 $400 whatever one unit or whatever it is you sell is limit it in some way two three people per person make it 90% off 80% off so you get paid for it limit it to referrals of friends so they're not going to use it on themselves so they bring you more customers get the threeway introduction
(07:37) so you get the leads and then when you bring them in actually sit down them for a sale and this is one of those great things that you can use to immediately attract tons of new customers at a profit during the holidays when it's hard to break through so that's enough with that all right now we're going to talk about ooh nice and heavy what's inside of here I wonder what's in the Wonder Ball I wonder what's inside it what Wonders It may hold I wonder wonder wonder what's in Wonder B ah it's tickets so this strategy is about high
(08:03) ticket so let me explain how this works you look at what your services are and think what would the ultimate version of this be like 10 times or 50 times as expensive as what I I normally charge like a complete transformation this works especially well with Services which is what I'm focusing on you could probably think of a version of this for physical product if my normal client load let's say at my business is I have 100 clients I can't manage more than that then you say okay I'm going to limit this promotion to 5% of my
(08:26) customer base if you're a hair salon person and you have this many customers or your uh car productor of this many customers it doesn't really matter but you say this is how many I have and I'm limiting it to this you say hey I'm doing this personal program that you're going to get more service this is the 10x to 50 or 100x of your normal price with a massive scarcity so you limit it to 5 to 10% of your customers I'd recommend five if it's your first time cuz you want to sell out that's the point and then next year you can bump it
(08:52) to 6% 7% let's say that you sell normally a $200 thing well then you would sell something that's between $22,000 and $20,000 which sounds like a huge price Gap and it is but the thing is is that most customers are fractal and so what that means is that it's 8020 20% of customers will spend five times more than 80% and so when you do 5% it's actually 8020 twice so you have the remaining 20 that are the five time Spenders and you do another 80/20 on that that's the magic between 5% because those customers are two standard
(09:16) deviations Above the Rest of the group and we capitalize on that by making a product or a service package that people like that want to buy because it's scarce let's say you had 100 customers and you sell five of them a $55,000 package you make $25,000 and if you're used to making $10,000 a month or $20,000 a month from your remaining customer base you can literally double your Revenue that month only by selling 5% of your customers a much more expensive thing the key to making this work you build lots of hype around it
(09:42) before the holidays you advertise the crap out of how scarce it is and you talk about the minute it's going to go live and you prepare people you say hey have your credit cards ready be ready for it because I'm going to drop it and they're going to sell out immediately and then when you do the moment you get your first sale let everyone know four left three left two left one left sold out every time you do that you'll drive even more fomo and more scarcity and more purchases so that's the high ticket High scarcity strategy let's open up our
(10:07) next gift so much fun we've got shirts not only is there one shirt there's two shirts in this package now how are we going to do one shirt to get someone to buy two shirts I'll tell you so this strategy is called free with prepay buy X get Y3 we're talking holiday season we're talking Black Friday we're talking special OCC the key to this is how insane you make the free thing if you're giving away your core service then what you can do is think about what's the highest margin service I have and package that in a way that you can have
(10:40) people prepaid to get x amount free if it's services or buy X and get y free and I'll tell you the first place I learned this so there's a place in Nashville I saw and I came back 10 years later and it was still there and it had expanded so I was like oh they must be doing well and their entire window pane said buy one get two free and it was pairs of boots and I was like that's wild so I went inside the store and I was like huh I wonder how this works and the boots were all 600 bucks now if you're familiar with cowboy boots cowboy
(11:06) boots probably run about $200 normally so all they did was they tripled the price for one pair and said buy one get two free and they capitalized on the fact that for them specifically there was bachelorette parties and all the girls come in it's like well I'll buy one and then my friends will get two free or whatever and ideally if you really want this thing to crush you actually give more away free than you charge for so it's buy one get two free it's not even just buy one t-shirt get a second t-shirt free it's buy one t-shirt
(11:35) get three t-shirts free but the thing is is that for most products and services you can increase the price of the one and so if you want to have a level of service that you haven't offered before that you want to do specific for the holidays or a product you want to come out with this is the perfect time to do it because no one has any comparison for the pricing let's say normally I would sell these shirts for five bucks a pot I might say buy one shirt for $10 and get two free free now what ended up happening is that I got $10 and I sold
(12:02) three shirts which is really just like a 30% discount not a huge deal but the perception of how much more compelling get one to get more free than what you paid for is the thing that drives the buying Behavior so I just gave you two different physical products examples but this is actually super deadly with services but it can be abused and then some people can become dependent on this there are businesses that I have looked at in order to invest and decided not to invest because they were too dependent on this because it's such a strong
(12:27) strategy and the reason it's so strong is because there's all the cash is front loaded so normally if let's say you have a recurring membership of some kind that's $100 per month that means it's going to take you a year to get $1,200 but if you say hey I'll give you the year for $600 one time that's a crazy discount here's the key if you're really expensive for whatever it is that you sell they have to prepay it they can't lock in the price and then say can I make a payment plan on your discounted services like no it doesn't work that
(12:55) way that's the normal price if that's what you want with any of these things if you want to make sure sure that you limit downside if you are worried about too many people quote taking advantage of it you can drive even more scarcity by limiting quantity for most holiday promotions I'd recommend doing anyways because one you can just get your immediate shot you don't risk the business and you can take some cash off the table that you can buy your own Christmas Rees with this one I've even seen work really effectively as a grand
(13:18) opening strategy even though we're talking about holidays but if you wanted to cash flow the opening of a facility so that you could cover all the costs of the place without even having to take Capital out of your pocket you just say hey for the first 50 people who sign up as patients at my chiropractor clinic or my first 50 patients at my dental clinic or my first 50 whatevers you just say cool if you buy Six I'll give you six and they're like holy cow what a deal now again you control the price and you can control the service and this is a
(13:45) key part let's say we want to have this $100 a month as our standard service so what we'll do is we can bump this price let's say to $200 a month for this promotion pause don't think I'm doing something ethical let me explain you then add in one to two things you wouldn't normally do with the main service that don't cost you a lot but is enough to differentiate the offers so that if someone else later comes in is paying $100 a month this person doesn't get upset because you can clearly say well that person doesn't get these
(14:11) things that you get and they're like oh that's the reason why and so if you're going to use this promotion if you're already in business come up with a service level that you already have add one to two things you can increase the price and then do buy Six get six or buy four get eight and you can drive an insane amount of cash and purchases in a short window and then you can limit it by saying no more than x can buy and it's one of the strongest promotions that you can run any time of the year but specifically during the holidays it
(14:37) crushes so that's our buy X get y free now let's talk about the final thing which is the wrapping paper itself so we gave four strategies on how you can maximize how much dollars you make or in the holidays let's see what present number five has so we've got a magic hat and a magic wand now why is this relevant it's actually more about the wrapping paper itself because every one of the strategies that I outlined is basically a gift that you can deliver to your customers and you can actually use them year round but they're especially
(15:07) powerful during the holidays but the key is how you want to wrap it because let's be real you're not going to change your entire business for the holidays to make something sound different but you can make it look different based on how you present it and that's where the magic wrapping paper comes in I call it magic because it's an acronym m is a magnetic reason why all right this is key the reason why we already have saw for us because it's the holay all right the big reason why is it's Black Friday and everyone expects that but the rest of
(15:34) the year you can still use the same concept the second is the Avatar is that you actually want to say who you're targeting you don't want to just say this is available for everyone you want to say it's available for a local market or for somebody of a certain age group or someone has a certain interest any of those things you want to call out so they're like oh this is for me and then they pay attention G is for goal is what's the ultimate outcome you want the person to experience what is the dream that they Envision in their minds that
(15:56) you want to say that you can help them deliver through the gift that we're wrapping with this wrapping paper the I is for a time interval which basically just says when is this person going to get this goal or when are they going to experience it and then C is something that I call the container word I don't have a fancy word for this I just know that it has worked and it continues to so this is when you say blueprint accelerator program intensive whatever right Launchpad like there's a million different words that you can use to
(16:23) bucket in all of the things that you're trying to sell in one bundle if I wanted to do something around stress right I might say Avatar busy moms so we got our Avatar check goal is relaxation holidays is my reason why interval 30 days and then this would be getaway so just like that we can create our busy mom's 30-day relaxation getaway for the holidays boom and so if we're a spa we put this together in the call out for our promotion this becomes the naming convention that we use around the first four so this could be our reason
(17:03) why we're doing a loss leader for the diapers or that we are giving the gift card or making it available is because we want them to bring their other busy mom friends or if we have a high ticket thing then we say this is only for this specific type of person which is why only 5% of our audience can buy it because it's the high scarcity High ticket program or the reason we're saying you can buy one and get two free is because of these things and so this magic wrapper allows you to give the wrapping paper that we're going to put
(17:31) on any of the first promotions to get even more people to want to buy yours compared to everyone else's and that's all the money-making magic you need during the holidays

3 Simple Steps To Close Any Sale - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CojS0DwflXc

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on everyone i want to make a quick video for you guys about the only three things to say when closing or selling and the reason this came up was uh recently i was on uh i was coaching our sales team uh on just just going over game tape footage which is like hey how's you know let's let's watch the sale from yesterday you know what we could what was done well what was great what was bad what could have been improved etc and one of the the habits that some of our team gets in because our our sales team is really
(00:27) knowledgeable we call them business consultants because they really are i mean they really are business consultants you know what i mean and that's why sometimes it's harder to find good sales people because they have to have um a really high level of understanding if you're going to like the higher the level of the business that you're going to be selling the higher level of expertise the person talking them must have if they have no context that's why like low level transactional sales like if you're doing b2c
(00:49) you know supplement sales over the phone you really don't need to have an exquisitely you know knowledgeable uh a rep it's more about a very transactional process that's going to be very highly scripted minimum variability right whereas if you're talking about a complex business deal right um then you need to have a very good understanding of their business where there's potential opportunities et cetera right and so sometimes it can be difficult because you may want to switch and this is especially true when it's uh
(01:18) if you're the owner of the business or you're you know integrally involved in just a couple of sales people you may get into the mode of trying to teach which is one of the biggest um a mistakes but b um one of the biggest hard things to not do there's some good words um as a salesperson right because if you're trying to close a deal you want to educate the person but the reality is that's not they're not going to listen to you until they buy and so there's no actual point in quote teaching but you do want to coach and that's
(01:48) something that i was talking about with my team yesterday is the difference between teaching and coaching and so fundamentally there's only three types of statements that should come out of your mouth when you are selling number one and most likely to be coming out is questions all right so if you don't know what types of questions um like for us i i prefer question-based frameworks for more complex sales um and the reason for that is these are the types of questions that we would need to know the answer to in
(02:14) order to work with someone it's also the only way you can get someone to change their beliefs about something because ultimately the person especially the more complex the higher level the sale the the more the person has to come to the conclusion on their own that they should work with you and less feel forced or suggested hopefully that makes sense and so we should ask leading questions that lead them to the conclusion that they should work with you can solve their problems the second uh type of thing is a restatement which
(02:42) means uh after they say something you say it back to them which means that you understand and you are listening all right so it's like so what i'm hearing is this is the primary issue that you've been trying to solve this is what you've done so far and this is why it hasn't worked does that sound about right so that would be an example of restatement notice none of these things are our declarative statements of fact i'm not teaching them anything all right which is the same reason that people get in trouble when they do
(03:09) presentations to try and pitch they try and teach the thing is is person has to have their beliefs broken in order to take action and you're not providing value in a real way because the reality is they're not going to execute on anything you teach them they will only execute if they have their beliefs broken and believe you can help them and then that they can trust what you are saying this is like this was so hard for me to learn because in the very beginning when i started gym lunch i just wanted to go in and get on the phone and jim's oh no
(03:33) no your pricing is all wrong you got to do this you got to do this guy do this and they were just like take lots of notes and then end up getting off the call not buying and then be like well uh i don't even know who this guy is i'm just going to ignore it and so i didn't actually help them i thought i was helping them but i was not actually helping them and i actually heard this from talking more a good friend of mine he said everyone gets benefits from breaking beliefs only 10 of people get benefits from tactics
(03:58) and so you actually are providing more value on the call by questioning their beliefs because you're actually servicing a hundred percent of the people providing value compared to trying to give tactical advice that only one out of ten people may or may not use and likely the people who will use it are not buying from you so either way you're you're not benefiting your business and you're also not benefiting there's that was a huge thing that i had to break with my own beliefs and so then you might be wondering well if i'm only
(04:22) asking questions and restating things how do i close the deal great great question glad you asked all right and so what i like are short stories and so the reason we do this is that so we'd ask a question ask a serious question hey why are you here what are you struggling with where you at right now where you trying to go what have you tried so far how's that working for you um why is this important does it matter like within the bigger context of of your life and what you're trying to do okay great this is what i'm hearing i
(04:50) think this is why uh you haven't been successful would you agree with that does that make sense fantastic do you want to hear how our program works right so at that point you'd enter quote the pitch right which is where you're gonna explain how the services work this is where most guys and gals will just blab right they'll just talk and talk and talk and talk and talk and try and teach and about how they have this secret system in the and really uh i think russell brunson calls it technobabble it's like you talk about your periodization you
(05:14) talk about your plan or you talk about your programs you're talking about the softwares or whatever right the route is they don't care and so all we have to do realistically is tell a story that illustrates what they're going to experience as a result all right and so um if i were trying to sell uh you know i'll just use gym launch as a simple example so if i'm like listen fundamentally until you learn how to market your business you're never going to be free and earlier you said that the goal when we asked for context is that you want to
(05:45) you want to be free you want this business to be able to run on its own um does that sound about right yes okay cool well then then do you see a world in which you're going to be able to outsource the most important part of your business which is acquisition lead generation lead nursery and sales do you feel like there's a world where you can just offload that responsibility and then somehow have a reliable business because what if that business goes out of business which is likely happens all the time then what right you're never actually
(06:08) going to be free until you learn this which means you have to confront this either today tomorrow or 10 years from now but you're going to have to do it does that sound fair does that make sense right and so here what i'm doing is i'm trying to i'm telling i'm telling a story to break a belief i'm not saying let me show you how we're going to teach you how to market instead i'm saying we have to at least come to an agreement that you need to learn this skill does that sound fair yes and then the next kind of mini story and if i if they
(06:35) didn't understand it then it would be like well this is the difference between giving a fish and teaching a man to fish right now you need to learn how to fish for yourself right in order for this business to be sustainable for you right right and so these are little analogies that you've already pre-packaged if i was selling weight loss i would say something like all right well fundamentally you know fitness nutrition accountability you need these three things fitness-wise you're gonna have to come and work out
(06:57) here we agree that you need to work out right right why haven't you been working out so far i don't know how fair enough is it also because you're not motivated to do it yes what if you actually what do you what something that you like doing well i like doing i like watching tv cool what if what if working out was something that you could look forward to as much as or more than watching tv if you liked working out more than watching television which one would you think you would do why probably work out right so our goal
(07:20) is not to get you to work out but learn to like working out more than watching television if we can accomplish that then we're going to solve this problem for good does that make sense yes notice i told them they're going to have to work out i did not talk about the the the new the exercise selection we're going to do the programming how we're going to ramp up their volume their undulating periodization the fancy exercise like none of that stuff we talked about because it doesn't matter we have to just come to an agreement that this is
(07:46) what we're going to be doing to solve the problem does that make sense yes fantastic when we move forward right and so you'll have these pre-packaged ideas and other examples if i if i had somebody who wasn't i'm giving you these examples to hopefully drive the point home if someone said uh you know you're gonna have to change the way you eat for example and i'd say okay well you've probably tried stuff in the past right i'm not gonna talk to him with a [ __ ] meal plan right it doesn't matter right it does matter but not in this conversation it
(08:10) does not matter fundamentally you're going to change the way you eat because what you got like why you are here is because of something you are currently doing does that sound fair right okay cool so again with this example i'd be like well do you like cake do you like cookies yes okay so then the key do you think you could not eat cookies for this your life do you think you cannot eat cake or not eat ice cream thrust your life do you think that's reasonable no i don't think that's reasonable cool so then we have to figure out a way for
(08:34) you to eat the things that you enjoy and still lose weight and do it in a way so that you look forward to it because at the end of the day if you like the food more than you're currently eating you will stick with it does that sound fair yes because do you think that you can sustainably give yourself willpower for the rest of your life no okay well then can we agree that all we have to do is just simply figure out the foods that you will like and that's an iterative process for us and we'll walk through it but the end
(08:57) goal is that you will like this more than you're currently eating and as a result of that will stick with it which means that over the long haul you'll get to where you want to go does that sound fair yes notice again this is an explanation this is a this is a mini story this is an analogy that we'll use and you should have multiple of these so you can drive the point home if you feel like the prospect does not understand what you are saying right and so this is where we are we are coaching based on beliefs we are
(09:21) not explaining or tacticalizing or technobabbling about our program because fundamentally it does not matter they don't care nor will they listen they're not even paying whenever you have a monotone you can see it in gong recordings if you don't if you don't record this you can see talk time you can see where engagement goes down and in invariably it's when a salesman gets to this part of the pitch and then they talk for five minutes straight no one cares i'm sure like i'm sure that when you've been if you've ever been
(09:51) sold something you feel like the person isn't listening to you right and so what i can say is the best way to sell is to have the person feel like you understand them and the best way for someone to feel understood is for you to actually give a [ __ ] if you actually give a [ __ ] you will know what questions to ask in what order because those are the questions that you would naturally ask the reason scripts were even invented is to mimic or structure a conversation between somebody who cares and someone that they can help
(10:23) that is what a sale is is we're we're breaking their beliefs we're coaching them to the conclusion that they have not been able to make up for this point which is that they need to work with us in order to solve their problem and we should be okay with the fact that i would like to provide value to this person so that i can break their beliefs around this whether they work with me or not this is still the type of solution that they're going to need and if you can approach it like that you stop having your ego tied up in your closing
(10:44) percentages in your numbers and instead you start helping people on the phone and by extension you will sell more deals all right and it's not by proving your expertise and and ego ego babbling about how smart you are right instead it's asking them questions making sure they understand that you're that you're tracking what they're saying asking more leading questions restating what they said and then when they ask you about how they could potentially work for you then and only then you give them the stories to explain how
(11:13) it works that's the deal and one of the big rules that i was hitting on with our sales team yesterday is you do not pitch the program until you believe the person will say yes lawyers do not ask questions they do not already already know the answers to no guy most guys don't propose to someone without already know the person's gonna say yes the the take rate on proposals is very high right let's be real most you know girls say yes to a proposal most right i'm not saying all but most do and sales should be the same way
(11:45) if you feel like you don't think you're going to close this person do not pitch them continue to stay in this circle where you are asking questions and reinstating and clarifying until you can eventually find that that piece that thread that was unexposed that you need to pull to then get them to say that aha that's the issue right and so from this the three things that you should be using when you're closing is you should be asking questions you should be restating what they said and then once you've exhausted these
(12:13) pieces where it becomes obvious that they you need to move on the sale only at that point they'll say well how do i how do i work with you how does the program work they should be asking you or you can at the very least say would you like to know the programmers i think it might be a good fit for you at that point they can give you permission to say yes now if someone says yeah hey hey tell me how the program works it's like no i don't think we're ready for that right now i need to understand more about your business otherwise it's not gonna it's
(12:35) not gonna make any sense i don't have enough context right and again when you do that you can retake the frame in the conversation if someone's commanding you around you're not going to close the deal right and so a lot of times usually within the first five to 10 minutes you can tell whether you're not going to close the deal most people most experienced sales people know by how the first five to ten minutes go whether this person's really even five minutes um you can tell whether you're gonna be able to close
(12:58) this person or not and if you don't feel like you're gonna be able to close this person it means you need a state shift you need to shift the frame and the only way to do that is to ask questions that are challenging one of the things i have my team say is closers ask hard questions right is ask questions that are going to challenge their current paradigm if they're in a current paradigm that they're getting on the phone because they want to prove to themselves that nothing's going to work for them then you need to say it sounds like it
(13:21) sounds like you're out a lot sounds like your business is kind of there's no way for you to succeed does that sound about right and then they're gonna sell you on why you're wrong but by selling you and why they're wrong they're taking a contrarian stance which then proves to you that there is a way rather than saying no i think you can be successful they're like no i can't be successful right and so understanding that before you get into your pitch the person must already be sold on working with you is one of the biggest things i can give
(13:44) you right now so if your script has too many paragraphs and too much explanation and all of that stuff then it's off it just needs to be questions and restating for clarification that you are hearing what they're saying and asking the next natural question that will lead logically to them working with you and asking the question at the end which is well how do i do this that sounds amazing that's exactly what i want like how do i move forward with the details etc and then at that point you say cool this is how it works ready to rock and roll
(14:08) all right fair enough hope that makes sense keep being awesome lots of love and i'll see you guys on flip side bye

I sold everything - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) last year i sold a 12 million business two businesses for just under 50 million and two cars that were both exotic cars and a four million dollar house in austin and that left me with really no i would say i mean i did have like equities and stocks and stuff but i didn't really have like material belongings and i did that because i wanted to have a reset and so what i want to do in this video is talk to you about one um what life was like or why i made the decision two what life was like after i made the decision what i learned
(00:30) and then some of the realizations i had along the way and what i'm doing now and so if you don't know who i am my name's alex mozy i own acquisition.com we have a portfolio of companies that's about 85 million a year make these videos because i just want to transfer whatever lessons i have learned along the way to hopefully help some other people let's dive in so why did i go and sell everything last year i think the biggest thing is it felt very heavy i felt like i had all these material things that were weighing me down and taking my
(00:54) attention and i have lived my life in seasons and what i mean by that is like i look back on my life and i've had like three to five year seasons i had a season where i went to college and then became a management consultant i had a season of running gyms i had a season of licensing gyms and starting three kind of bigger companies which is what we just sold last year and the season that we're in now which is now we just full time you know find uh service-based businesses or e-learning businesses that are doing like one to ten million a year
(01:21) um in profit and invest in them right that's what we do now i thought that i wanted to have and i said this often my dream state going into this was i want to have an unlimited credit card and just consume my lifestyle with one bag and my wife and i more or less did that after we sold so i basically got rid of all my clothing with the exception of like one bag's worth and we set off and spent a bunch of time in different areas and part of this was because we wanted to figure out where we wanted to live and i have a the the requirements for
(01:54) what i was looking for i have this big list that i made uh before we did this journey and i'll tell you where we went in a second but i wanted something and this might be useful for you to like you know think through i wanted things to be walking distance from me so having lived in a handful of different areas very expensive areas very cheap areas um i realized that 90 of like my life is really just predicated on the things that are in my immediate walkable distance and so i wanted nature to be in walkable distance because we like layla
(02:20) and i walk probably an hour or two every day um i wanted restaurants because we got to eat a lot and having the convenience of just something that we can go eat regularly is really you know useful and has high utility for us number three is i wanted to have a very sick gym in like the immediate vicinity and that's because for me i've realized that that's a very important part of my life in terms of like things that bring me joy and then number four having a grocery store really nearby that sounds silly but like it's actually very
(02:44) convenient to have growth so those are like my big walking distance things that either have to be inside the building or within like walkable distance in terms of like things that the home that i wanted to have requirements was a view of either the ocean lake or mountain like that was important to me because at least for me when i look out the window like it's nice super fast wi-fi a hot tub slash pool with a view an office and studio three bedrooms minimum ideally more um and a big balcony or patio all right those are like kind of the house
(03:12) things and then additional features were kind of like more area specific so it has to be reachable by amazon prime i want it to be in a zero tax state because for me uh the difference between two different areas is much more dependent on the sub market that you are in so like for example people like to say that they love a certain city but i think if you really think about it there's just a handful of tiny little neighborhoods because like you as one human probably are like oh i visited nashville one weekend
(03:37) nashville's awesome and what you're making a judgment on like nashville is the three to ten people that you spent time with and the you know six places that you went when nashville has a thousand places and so it's like we take these we make these snap judgments on areas based on such limited data they're almost irrelevant you could have a terrible experience in nashville because you had the wrong people or the wrong three to five locations that you visited and an amazing one in cincinnati because you were in a very wealthy area
(04:04) and that was the microcosm and you probably wouldn't even know the difference if you were in the suburbs of cincinnati versus the suburbs of whatever you know what i mean and so i've realized this because layla and i actually spent two years on the road before we settled down to start the three bigger businesses doing gym turnarounds and so we actually were in 33 cities in 18 months and we spent like two to three weeks in each one of them and so we got a lot of feel for what america feels like and what's interesting is there was a couple times
(04:31) where i was i was walking through like a target and i remember thinking to myself i knew the target like the back of my hand because almost all of them are set up the same way and i was like what city am i in again and the thing is is like most cities especially in like the higher end areas if that's what you're trying to get into they have the whole foods they have a target they have the same chains of rust like it's all so similar that we have these like super strong beliefs about like one city versus another and they're almost
(04:57) identical when you get into like the sub markets right and so for me that's why and i've made videos about why i don't think you should make decisions based on tax i have no marginal difference in living and so since there is no marginal difference i then say okay well if there's no difference then i would rather pay less in taxes and so that is why zero percent tax was one of the the requirements or preferences rather i wanted to have a way to meet lots of neighbors that were interesting and so this is one of those like i prefer to
(05:22) live in a wealthy area because then and ideally ultra wealthy and i say that because i've lived in quote wealthy areas and you get a lot of upper middle class and there's nothing wrong with that it's just that those people don't necessarily understand like my lifestyle or the things that i find important they just had very different priorities than me and it it became very difficult to have any kind of meaningful conversations or relationships in general because there's just not a lot of common ground the next one is i
(05:46) ideally and i cover good entrepreneurship a central airport close by and so i'm sharing these things so that maybe these you can add them to your own personal list as you're looking for houses and and where you want to set up shop a central airport close by because i do travel a lot and or people travel to me you know if you're in a you know b or c market sometimes you have to have always connections to get everywhere and for me that's a massive pain and so i prefer to have a big airport that i can get direct anywhere i
(06:08) want to go or people can have direct to me i wanted to also lock it and leave it flexibility so because i travel and because i like flexibility and that is what i kind of optimized for i wanted to be able to lock the house and leave it and then come back and not have like a ton of stuff that i had to like figure out i wanted to also be in a market that i could attract talent so if i was going to hire people which is probably certain i wanted to be in a market that um i could attract the best talent and if i
(06:32) was going to have a an office i would want the office to be within 15 minutes of my house and part of that is predicated on the idea of if if you're going to have something that you have a business where you have in-person employees then that would be a function i currently don't have this um and i think that we made the decision um over the last year to go remote and i'll walk through that um in a second but sold everything these are the requirements that i had and then layla and i spent basically the last nine months living
(06:57) all over the place and so we went to just for an idea we spent a month in cabo which was awesome by the way really sick like really really like cabo personally and maybe that's just the microcosm that i experienced but the microcosm that i experienced in san jose and san lucas we spent two weeks in each was really nice and i actually really enjoyed it a lot it was totally americanized you could like you could get around not speaking spanish with like zero problems and everything was really cheap which is also a nice
(07:22) benefit and like the real estate there like you can get an ocean front infinity pool you know six thousand eight thousand square foot mansion for like five million dollars which you know in the us would probably be like 20. so i mean like there's still just a massive price difference and if you did choose to live there six months or more of the year you actually functionally pay no state income tax as well as a fun side benefit so we went to cabo we went to scottsdale we went to flagstaff we went to bear lake in utah
(07:51) which is like a beautiful mountain lake set up highly recommend really nice and then uh we went to vegas and there's a couple we went to southern california uh for a while we we went all over you know what i mean and you're like that's a lot of pacific southwest and that's true so i guess it's not that all over um but for us those are kind of a lot of different it had a lot of different feels to it and so after going through that where we basically owned nothing just had the bags and traveled and just you know leased the lifestyle for for
(08:16) for lack of a better term and i would say to give you an idea in terms of like the scale of what we were renting we were probably renting stuff in the neighborhood of like 50 to 100 000 a month in terms of cost so like they were high high-end places that were nice and this is kind of this is kind of what i learned now a year later from that kind of process the first one is that i i think the idea that i had of wanting to have an unlimited credit card and just consume my lifestyle lease the lifestyle and then walk away from
(08:41) wherever i was and just leave it behind the cool part about it was like we could go we're like where do we want to go next but i think that after having done it i really did miss the elements of familiarity of having people who knew you all around having social circles you know like you can't stay somewhere for a month and then and really get to know people or build any kind of meaningful relationships so that was kind of not as expected i just didn't think through it the other one that was kind of interesting for me was was i didn't have
(09:09) all my stuff around me like i have gone very accustomed to having like my little spots where i have all the stuff that i like and you're like well alex you're in a closet right now and that's because i'm in a tiny condo and i actually don't like windows where i work because for me i get super easily distracted and i'll just start out the window and like 30 minutes will go by and i wouldn't even realize it and so that is why i'm in a closet for those who are like why do you have so much money and why do you have
(09:30) such a shitty office that's why beyond that you can't really make changes to long-term rentals the way you can a house you will probably like things a certain way and i think the more the more money you have and the more you learn about yourself the more particular you sometimes become because you've just realized that these are things that add attention back in your life so you get more bandwidth and so i have a lot of particulars you know what i mean in terms of like how i like i like having a recording studio i don't have one right
(10:00) now that's why we're here but i like having recording studio i like having a gym that's like in my house that's commercial level or within walking distance from me because i just like being able to work out when i want to work out and not have it be like a thing i like i like the mess the you know the sweet views but it's also like i like all my stuff in the kitchen you know what i mean like i like my sauces and my my my supplements and just the stuff that i it's just my stuff you know what i mean and in the least your lifestyle
(10:27) thing like i think there's there's i over corrected for like i don't like having stuff to going all the way the other way where i had nothing and i think that it's probably more in the middle and so i'll tell you what we ended up settling on i think that as you as you become more you know ultra wealthy whatever you want to call it like as you as you level up and the reason i'm making this is because like i didn't know this as i was going into it so hopefully i can just help someone avoid the over correction that i made is
(10:51) that i think the ideal setup is having two to three maybe four primary homes that you actually stock with all your stuff in the meantime so you can just basically pick up and leave so you have the flexibility of moving but you have the familiarity of like your things and then in the meantime you can still go travel but you still have like a home base not having a home base uh was not advisable i felt kind of like uh i felt like a nomad but like free-floating in a way that i didn't like and i realized that over time as we were kind of going
(11:18) through this process one of the other realizations that i had was around hedonic adaptation which is basically like as you get exposed to new cool stuff eventually you get used to it and it no longer confers any value and so like people get this you know can this can this can be real for you in terms of like if you've ever bought a new car um it's really cool for the first however long and then within like a month or two it's just like that's the car i have right and some people are like car super enthusiasts but even then
(11:44) they buy another car and buy other cars because they kind of get used to hedonic adaptation the things that you had and so um layla and i did this like uh pooled leasing thing where we like can swap out our car whenever we want so it's like you pay a fixed price i think it's like a thousand bucks a month and then you can like swap your car whenever you want uh but you pay for like you but you commit to like a year so anyways kind of interesting you think that you're going to switch cars up but then you never
(12:06) want to do the pain in the ass and so i've actually had the exact same car since day one um so it's like some of these things you think you're going to do and then you don't actually end up doing it which for me was like a fun uh interesting thing and my uh my videographer was like hey man you should answer this question so he sent me these questions for this video which was like how do you how do you see materialism and so i having you know having had the ability to buy pretty much whatever i want you know including private jets and things
(12:28) like that i know that for me not only do most of those things not bring me joy but i actually feel a certain amount of like wastefulness and maybe that's just something that's internalized to me uh but like i just i don't like waste in general and so to me it just it actually it's almost net negative and buying things for the sake of status i've gotten over that a long long time ago i don't really the only thing i ever bought that would i think i would consider like a status symbol was i got a bentley which is one of the cars
(12:56) i sold last year it was a flying spur it was brand new it was like 300 and something thousand and i got it because a lot of people were like dude you never spend money like you should live a little bit and so i was like okay i'll try it and i i used it and i'll say the benefits of having the exotic car this is the only benefit that i think functionally helped is that when you pull up to places people do treat you better and so i enjoyed the higher level of service but i think there was kind of a taint to it because
(13:21) i knew that i didn't get that treatment when i would have just a normal car and then it made me like see people in a worse way which is which is crappy i probably shouldn't have made that conclusion but i like flying under the radar and just doing my own thing um and that definitely attracted attention so there's there's elements that were good there was elements that were bad uh was it worth the money absolutely not i don't really care about cars at all um and i did it definitely for the wrong reason but in
(13:43) some ways i'm glad i did so that i can just say like i now know that for me it's useless so maybe that'll save you three hundred thousand dollars in a waste of a car and then you know what do i think about jets uh private jet wise i think it's really nice for travel to be honest with you like it's one of the few things that i still spend money on uh because there's a there's a lot of function for it right like and people are like how can you not like waste and then do that well the jet is already there and it's either sitting there it's
(14:06) being used so in some ways i'm actually less wasteful as i'm using it but the relative cost and people really have to understand this is like i've taken home more than a million dollars a month for the last half decade so like just imagine like a million dollars hits your bank account and then a month goes by and another million dollars hits your bank account and then another month goes by and then another million dollars and then you do that for years and then all of a sudden like the cost of things relative to your income becomes very
(14:29) very low i'll give you a math example to explain this but like let's say you just did 10 million dollars which is less than a million dollars a month fyi if you took on 10 million dollars a year and the average american family takes home 50 000 a year then everything so it's 200 times more money than the average american family and so if something costs let's say 10 000 right divide that by 200 and you've got 50 and so it costs 50 bucks for me relatively to take a private flight if you if you're not at that income level yet i'm trying to make it
(15:00) relative so it makes sense but like if you had the option of immediately pulling your car up getting on the plane having no one else on the plane getting to your destination having a car there already packed with your stuff you get out of the plane into the car on the runway so it's literally like you drive two hours and then you drive again and so it's like literally just the transit time is the transit time which makes all of the us way more accessible to you and for me i don't waste days i'm not exhausted i don't
(15:24) have like a recovery period and i am more likely to travel because the hassle is low and what it does do and this is the biggest thing that i can communicate of flying private is that it it it shifts it transforms transport from a negative experience to a positive experience it's not even like i would say like traveling first class still overall a negative experience just less negative but uh but flying private is almost i would say a positive experience and so that is really the biggest transformation that happens when you fly
(15:54) private which is why i still do it but i just wanted to give you guys an example but like if that if you were able to transform the experience from negative to positive not have the the the drain the men the mental and emotional drain the energy drain the the recovery time that would have to occur the prep time the getting your documents the defining the flights and all that kind of stuff if you got if you got to skip all that um would you pay 50 for that rather than paying a dollar right most people would make that difference right if it's like
(16:20) it's a buck for normal normal flight and 50 for the for the private one like a lot of people i think would make that trade and so that's the reason that people you know why people who have more do make that trade is because like relative to income it makes more sense okay so the the last piece i'm gonna hit on is kind of like my unifying theory in terms of how i make decisions around material goods because it's like okay i have i had a lot of stuff a lot a decent amount of stuff sold it all lived almost a year on the road uh with just a bag
(16:47) and now uh layla and i just bought a home a very nice home it's an eight-figure house so i'll just believe that's a really nice house and it's on a mountaintop and it's really cool and i like it a lot why why would i do that after this whole period so number one is i do think it's necessary or at least for me i don't want to speak that over you but like for me i prefer having a home base a headquarters where all my stuff is and so i think that from there we can do the travels we can do the consumption but then we have some
(17:14) place to come back to and so that's number one number two is that from a work season which is what i'm entering again now because i'm we're building up acquisition.com companies so we're taking all the portfolio companies actively as we speak right now that are in that you know e-learning and service space business service consumer services and growing those companies actively right now and it's a ton of fun and there's nothing that's more interesting to me and so for me like i don't need any stimulation from my exterior
(17:38) surroundings because i get so much stimulation from the work that i do and so that is that is paramount that is the the biggest priority and so that's where the home base becomes really helpful because i'm just more efficient and more productive when i have all the things that i already know that work well for me around me and so from a unifying theory standpoint it comes down to form over function and so i will spend money on things that are expensive i'll use quotes here if they have improved function and so i don't
(18:06) have one of my flannels with me but like the flannels that i wear are actually really expensive and it's just because they like fit me really well and i like them and so i buy them this on the other hand i get five packs from amazon for like 10 bucks and so like because i've had the really expensive like lululemon tank tops and stuff and like i like these cheap cotton ones better they breathe better and they don't they don't bother me and i they're interchangeable and they can get dirty when i go to the gym and if something tears i don't care
(18:37) right um and so that's that's why i wear these things right and so from a from a form perspective or sorry from a function perspective that is what i make all my decisions based on and so i think that for uh having kind of lived the entire spectrum if you can have a unifying theory around how you buy things i think it would be incredibly helpful and from a clothing perspective this is a nice one that i that i picked up is i've realized that lots of clothing actually decreases my quality of life and so when i walk into
(19:07) a closet and i see lots of clothes or lots of t-shirts i feel guilty um and maybe i could fix that about myself but for me it's much less effort to just fix the surrounding and so i realized when i gave away 90 of my clothing and just kept 10 for the bag that i actually felt better and i was like huh okay so this is something that i'm keeping with me even though i'm going to a headquarters that has all my stuff clothing is not among them that are meaningful to me and so if i'm going to buy something i have to in my mind i'll throw something else
(19:35) out so that way my my actual closet stays around stays the same size but the quality always increases in terms of like its net utility to me and so i have to take out something that's the lowest utility shirt or shorts and then replace it with something that has higher utility overall and as a fun side note i have found that for me if i find a shirt that i like i will buy six colors that i like in that shirt and i will usually replace in bulk the other t-shirts that i had prior to that that didn't fit me necessarily as well as these ones did um
(20:04) and so you're like are you really talking to me about these things well these are the things that you that you think through as you're trying to optimize different aspects of your life so that you can make better decisions and have more head space throughout the day so you can ultimately make more money uh or at least that's how i function that is the that is kind of where we landed was uh the one really really really nice home and we will probably buy another place that will be in the summer and winter and so weather
(20:25) which i should have mentioned earlier was a primary driving factor and so i figure that between two and three climates i can have the weather that i want year round with the novelty of change of environment without having the nomad feeling of not having any of my stuff and so that is kind of the plan that we are moving through right now is having two to three homes in different areas with different vibes so probably beach mountain and then probably lake uh would be like the baby desert just have different vibes and then like in the
(20:56) summers when it's really hot in you know like vegas then i'll go somewhere that's really cool and so that way i can kind of get the best of everything and not also have to be like on the track you know on the road all the time because to me that is also somewhat stressful now having done it for a year i made this video because i did not know this as i was coming up and i thought first i should have lots of stuff and i did that and that weighed me down and then i transitioned to selling everything and just leasing my lifestyle
(21:24) and when i did that i realized that i did like having some stuff maybe not all of it and so i think that like buddha the middle path is the way and so you can have the nothing and you can have everything and i think that everyone just has to figure out what the just right is for you but for me my unifying theory around it is form over function sorry function over form so what it does for me and the net utility it provides me in my life is the primary driving factor and then that gives me a decision-making process that makes my life easier
(21:55) because like we make thousands of decisions every day as entrepreneur and if you can have a unifying theory it's kind of a decision algorithm like if this than that then you can pre-make decisions and then you can always just run them through the algorithm without having to like use mental bandwidth and so in another video i'll walk you through like i've tons and tons of decision algorithms that i've already made to just make my life easier so that i can only so that i can allocate all of my time to making new decisions rather
(22:20) than remaking old ones um and so if you like this my name is alex mosey again welcome to mozy nation i hope you enjoyed the video and i'll see you in the next one

How to Start a Business From Nothing (Thank Me Later) - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=unshZobTt6Q

Transcript:
(00:00) I made my first $100,000 when I was 24 years old when I opened my first gym location. In this video, I'm going to cover everything I learned from that. And so, first, it's going to be how I started it. Next, my first h 100,000. And then third, and most importantly for you, the lessons and tactics that I still use to this day that you can use too to help you grow your business.
(00:22) And it felt appropriate to film this video in my current gym uh in the background because this is where kind of it all started for me. So, let's talk about how this even started. The reason this was the riskiest move in my life was that one, quitting my job was the hardest thing I ever did. Two, it was during a time where like the economy still wasn't like roaring. It was like kind of okay.
(00:36) And I had saved up $50,000 from my job. Now, I spent 10 to get into the the group for the gym owners. I actually signed up for a gym mastermind and I didn't have a gym, so I had like 40,000 left. And then I spent $34,000 opening up the location. So, I had $6,000 left. Mind you, the rent was five.
(00:59) And so I had exactly the amount of money like required to have like one month. And so I was like, "Oh my god, what am I going to do?" And so it was by chance that I went to a different seminar that taught about this thing called Facebook ad. And so I ended up running an ad. And here's the craziest thing of all. I actually only found this out years later.
(01:13) $4,972 in cash collected in the first month. And my rent was $4,972. I only found this out years later when I looked at my processing records and I was like, I'm not I'm not a divine, you know, dude, but wild.
(01:32) Um, and so I basically had no money and all my money was in the gym equipment and I um spent the thousand bucks basically that I had on these ads. And so when I started this one, I was like, man, this is this is hard. So first big lesson that I learned was when you're poor, barter. All right? And so I had basically no money. And so but I needed stuff. So I needed people who could train. I needed people who could clean.
(01:51) And so I had people come in and be like, I can't afford to do this. And I'd be like, hey, well, you want to clean the gym and if you clean the gym, I'll let you attend the classes. Because the like someone else attending a class for me wasn't really any cost for me. I mean, my costs were fixed. So anything that I could basically barter for $200 a month or $300 a month of services, I would just I did everything like that. I was like, "Hey, can you fix my computer? Want personal training?" Like I did that for like I got my first printer and
(02:16) scanner from a guy who had an IT company because he felt bad for me because I was doing everything on paper and he said you shouldn't do this and I just did PT lessons for him so that he would pay for that. And so like I just I barter like crazy. I still barter to this day because guys it's tax efficient.
(02:34) Neither party has to pay taxes on anything, right? It's the most efficient form of trade. So if you have the opportunity to do it, do it. On top of that, I actually had a client who was a food like a food prep person. And so they would end up uh bringing a refrigerator and I could eat the food uh that they would bring for free for having access to my members. So like I'm saying literally everything.
(02:53) My laundry I had a different client who did my laundry for me. Like everything that would take any of my time or money I just traded for so that I could spend all my time in the gym just trying to make this thing work. So if you're like, "Okay, well how do I apply this to make?" look at every single line item that you have on your like your expenses, right? Like your credit card or whatever, your bank account, and anything that I had, I just tried to find somebody who did that thing. And I just was opportunistically looking if somebody came in and they're like, "Oh, I do." Because I would always like, "Ah,
(03:18) what do you do?" And they would tell me, I'd be like, "Oo, I actually need one of that. Want to want to do this?" And this happened a lot. And I would just keep asking for less and less service until it was the amount of money that was the equivalent of a membership. And then I was like, "Sick, let's do that." my first ads.
(03:35) I got a videographer who came in because it was California, right? And this guy comes in. He's low. He's a small time videographer. And he was like, uh, I can't afford this. And I was like, well, I can't afford you. So, and so he recorded my f some of my first ads for the gym, which actually ended up crushing. And so, like just you got like bartering is one, but I'll put a second here, which is like be creative.
(03:53) And I think in order to do this, too, is that you just can't have an ego. Now, I was lucky that I was, you know, 23 and, you know, poor and and so like I had no shame for asking. I was like, "Please, like, help. I like I need it." And so, I think that a lot of I'll just I'll just be honest with you guys. I see a lot of y'all's Instagrams. You know who you are.
(04:11) And a lot of you guys are posturing and pretending like you have something that you don't. And it actually I think it actually does a lot of disservice to you because if you're like, "Hey, I need help. Hey, I'm trying to build this thing." People will reach out and help. People will be way more willing if you pretend like you're, you know, you've got it all figured out. No one's going to try and help you.
(04:28) And I think at that time is like when like when you're earlier on is when you want all the lessons, you want all the favors you can get. And the way that I could get extra calories in is that I would actually uh with the food preps up, I would sell clients on food prep and sometimes some of them wouldn't pick up all their meals. It happens. And so I would wait for the food to expire and then as soon as it expired uh we weren't allowed to distribute it anymore.
(04:46) And so I would just take it and I would eat all of the expired. It's fine. I call the people and if they didn't respond then I would then I would take it and that's that's how I fed myself. Um, and for those of you who have a moral quandry with me, suck it. Next thing, boy was trying to eat. I was growing. All right. Now, number two is that when you're early, you need tactics.
(05:03) All right? Which is why I make a lot of the videos that I do. Actually, to be fair, you need tactics at all levels, but especially when you're starting out because you're not really thinking in terms of strategy. You're just like, shoot, what fire should I have in front of me? I got to pay bills. Like, let's get this done.
(05:15) And so, I joined this mastermind of a guy who had a really successful gym, Sandbacktr, and he had a group of, I think, probably like 30 or 40 gym owners who kind of paid him to like kind of learn some of the stuff that he had. So, I showed up to this first mastermind and I'm 20 22 years old at the time and I didn't own a gym, but the most valuable thing that I got is so many mistakes that I didn't have to make that all of these guys had made when they started their gyms. And so, I just went around the room and I was like, "Hey, so what
(05:36) kind of location were you looking for?" And they were like, "Oh, definitely don't do it in these markets. You definitely want to have this kind of square footage. Try to get a layout that only has this much office and this much uh warehouse." I was like, and they're like, "Oh, yeah, parking.
(05:47) Make sure you have and so all of these things." And I was like, "Okay, I'm going to buy this equipment." They're like, "Oh, no. Don't buy that equipment. that stuff spreads really fast buy from this brand and I've got a guy I'll hook you up with him and like within the first conversation I was like oh my god I saved the entire cost of what I paid in the first day and basically that was such a reinforcing experience for me that whenever I enter anything I always just pay if I can to just get access to people who are already doing it and they can just tell
(06:11) me all the mistakes that I can avoid up front and this is why I invested in school like I think communities are the future anyways they also told me so on top of that what I would do is on my weekends when I had time which was basically never but when I did have time, I would make weekend trips to the other gym owners in the community.
(06:29) And so then I would just basically shadow them and pester them like a leech and I would just go there and I would just ask as many questions I could. I'd be like, "Why do you do that?" And then when they sign up, what do you do? Where do you put the contract? I asked a hundred questions. But the thing is is all these guys are older than me and they like kind of felt bad and they were like, "Hey, this is what I do. This is what I do. This what I do.
(06:41) " And I just took every note I possibly could. And so I think the meta lesson for me was that the thing that has carried me and to this day has just been the intention to keep learning. And I think that life like for me the meaning of life is learning is to change behavior. based on the conditions.
(06:52) And so I hope that I live the end of my life differently than I do now. Hopefully I'll have learned. And so um I went to those gyms. I asked tons of questions and all of those little things that I learned I would try. And not all of them worked obviously. But some of them did. And so I just tossed out the stuff that didn't work. I wasn't like screw that guy for trying to help me for free.
(07:09) Uh cuz he gave me a tack that didn't work. I was like, "Well, he gave me another one that did so works for me." And so I'll give you this little thing which is that when you're starting out, it's actually one of the only times that people are willing to help you. And so take advantage of that. Like this is a strategic advantage that you have when you're starting out is that people are willing to help especially other entrepreneurs. It's like fairly common.
(07:24) Like most entrepreneurs are willing to help people one or two steps behind them. Now this was a big mistake that I made which is number three which after I learned this I I forever change how I do every business. All right, which is that pre-sales. So I thought that the way that I should make money because I was like I don't have any money. I need to start this gym as fast as possible in order to make money. Completely wrong.
(07:45) we need to start doing is marketing and selling as fast as possible and then delay delivering as long as possible. Because every location I opened after my first after having learned this lesson, I was like, "Oh, we're going to pre-sell for three months and we're just going to keep marketing, keep selling, keep collecting cash, keep getting members, keep getting members, keep getting memberships, right? And then only like basically as long as possible because that's when all your costs start. So, it's like just market and sell. Get people to prepay for, you know, three
(08:08) months, six months, a year, right? get people into me in in a trial memberships that kick in later like whatever you need to do in the beginning to just start kind of with a bang. And so if you're brickandmortar more than anything, obviously every kind of business would benefit from a grand opening strategy, but if you're brickandmortar, grand opening strategy is is one of the core ways you scale. Like you cannot scale without having a killer grand opening strategy.
(08:31) Look at every every brickandmortar retail, food, gyms, like you know, massage, it doesn't matter. They have a a crazy grand opening strategy. Otherwise, like it takes so it takes way too long to get your money back, right? You have to be able to get be profitable as soon as humanly possible.
(08:48) And so, what I did with pre-sales as I got more sophisticated is that if I instead of being like, "Oh, I think I want to open up a location in, you know, La Habra, what I would do is I would run ads." So, I'd spend like $500 or $1,000 in five or 10 markets and I would see where I got the lowest lead costs.
(09:06) And so, as soon as I saw that, I was like, "Oh, well, some people are like, "Oh man, it's such like, dude, that guy's market is so easy compared to mine." And I'm going to be real with you, some markets are easier than others. Like there are better and worse markets absolutely for any type of service. But guess how you can pay down that risk.
(09:22) So instead of signing a lease, doing a buildout, and then beginning to market to figure out whether it's a good a good location or not, do it first. Worst case scenario, you spend the $5,000 or $10,000 in ads across 10 locations, and you pick a perfect spot, a one out of 10 spot rather than a who knows what location. So, instead of rolling the dice, pay $10,000 for pre-sale insurance of checking.
(09:40) And it's like, okay, if you're wondering, well, what do you do when uh when when when people opt in and then you don't have a location, do what 99% of business owners do anyways. Ignore the leads, right? That's what everyone else does. So, like, don't worry about it. Like, you'll be okay. They'll just keep living their lives.
(09:57) And you paid at Google and Google got their benefit and everybody's happy, right? But you get to avoid signing a five-year lease and a for 500 grand or whatever it is that you're signing for a bad spot. And I want to be really clear. Don't I can't believe I have to say this. Don't sell that you're not going to deliver.
(10:14) If for whatever reason you think you're not going to open up a location for for sake, don't take money and not deliver. Like a really great way to just have people hate you. So don't do that and get in trouble. Don't do that. So the next big lesson I have was variation in ads. All right. So I'm going to explain this. This skill ended up benefiting me for the rest of my life.
(10:34) And so when most marketers advertise on a national level, they get really lazy because they're used to running an ad and having an ad work for a month, two months, three months. Sometimes like YouTube ads are run for six months. I wasn't that guy at all.
(10:50) I had to make new ads like every week because my mole market is so small, right? And so in the in $100 million offers, the last chapter, I talk about the magic headline formula. And so basically what I what I figured out was that I can't I don't want to change my service, right? I don't I don't want to start like offering back massages or something at my gym like that.
(11:07) I don't you don't want to change your core thing, but what I want to do is change the wrapping paper. So it's the same present. I just present it differently. And so that's how I got, you know, that's how I figured out, oh, okay. Lean by Halloween, Slim for Santa, Big Booty Boot Camp, 42-day detox, 42-day fix, 42-day transformation, six week transformation, six week challenge. Like, I learned how to permutate my promotional headlines because I had to.
(11:33) And then later on, once I went to a national level, I was willing and able to make so much more variation in my ads and my copy and my lead magnets than my competitors because all of them were spoiled in this world where they only have to make a couple ads a month. I was like, I'm used to making 20 or 30 a week.
(11:49) And so, this is where I actually learned both the volume of creative and the variation and it's really just slight variation in the naming conventions uh of the promotions that I'm running. All right? And so, it might you want to make it look like a different offer, but you're still I mean, what's it going to be? It's still going to be you're going to work out a couple times a week, you're going to eat differently, you have a trainer, like the core deliverable is the same.
(12:07) It's not going to change, but you just change the way it looks to change the way it feels. And that's what keeps it new in a market. Yeah. And what's changed between when I learned this lesson and today is that the creative itself is part of the targeting now. And so who you have in the ads like like attracts like.
(12:25) And so if you want more girls, have more girls in the ads. You want more guys, have more guys in the ads. Want big jack guys, have more big jack guys. If like and so this is something that is more new now than then because then the targeting was much more uh basic. U but big picture, if you're local, you don't need to worry too much about this because you're just going to drop a pen and say everybody in this local area.
(12:42) But as you go national, that's where it becomes a little bit more important. Hey, and real quick, I spent 200 hours this year just making this one project for you, which is the $100 million scaling roadmap. And I broke up the stages of business into 10 stages. And you can identify where you're at by simply just putting in your business information. You go to acquisition.
(13:01) comromadap and it'll spit out this custom report that tells you what the constraints are at that current level and what you need to do to graduate and get to the next level. This is our gift to you absolutely free on the thank you page. You can book a call with our team and we'd love to help you uh figure that out and ideally get past it. So this is how it was generating leads.
(13:18) But then what was the actual offer that really like made or broke the business, right? And so this is where I learned the sixe challenge offer. And the six week challenge offer is a win-your offer. And there was also an unconditional money back guarantee that I paired with this. So it just made it an absolute hurricane of an offer.
(13:37) And if you're curious about guarantees, I have a chapter on guarantees in general, the guarantee formula, which is just if you don't achieve X by Y time, I will Z, which is what's the consideration. So you have some sort of thing, you're promising, there's some sort of timeline, you're promising it on some terms. And then you have what you'll give in consideration.
(13:56) And so one of the big mistakes people make when they're doing any kind of guarantee offer is that they say, I guarantee this. Yeah, but you have to say the or what, right? The or else. And it's the or what that gives the guarantee power. just the word guarantee is not going to do nearly as much as the stakes you're putting on the line.
(14:13) Now, inside of the book, I actually have 11 of my favorite guarantees that have I have used and work. And so, you can you can check those out. But the two guarantees that I use most frequently were a service-based guarantee and an unconditional guarantee. All right? So, let me explain what those are. So, a service-based guarantee is, hey, I'm going to help you achieve X by Y, but if you don't, I'll continue to work with you until you do.
(14:32) Now this matters more importantly when there's actual cost associated with delivery. If you're like I will you know you're you're a digital person it's like yeah you get access to this course for 6 weeks and if you don't hit the goal you keep getting access for another six weeks.
(14:50) It's like access is not that valuable of like I didn't hit it but we were actually training people and so for me that was like real stakes on the line and it was very compelling. The second guarantee that I offered was an unconditional guarantee, which is that during the six weeks, if at any point you feel like you haven't gotten $500 of value from us, independent of your results, I'll give you the money back.
(15:09) I says, "That means that five weeks, 6 days, and 23 hours from now, if you don't think that we gave you the value, I'll give you the money back." And I'm telling you, like that closed so many sales for me. And because we really obsessed on delivery, my team knowing that that guarantee exists forced them to just level up and be like, "We just have to bring it every day.
(15:34) " And I want to tell you the actual number, which is over the years of doing it, I had two people who asked me for the money back on the unconditional. Now, there were people who obviously hit the goal of losing 20 pounds in the six weeks, and they won it, which is fine.
(15:47) And that's kind of that was the that was the deal, right? Which if you aren't familiar with the offer, it was uh lose 20 pounds in 6 weeks. Obviously, this were for people who were over a certain BMI. If they were below the BMI, we would just say 10% of your body weight. So if it was like 140 pound uh you know person and they're like a little overweight, they lose 14 pounds in six weeks. That's like two pounds a week or two two and change. And mind you like I knew that people people were like ah in the comments like oh my god that's unhealthy.
(16:05) People gamed it. I know that. So when they came to weighin day they were they had six pounds of water and you know bricks in their pockets. Like I I knew people were gaming it right. It's like to be clear. And at the end they're like dehydrated like raisin, you know, they're naked on there just like you know covering covering themselves to like get underweight.
(16:24) So like the weight like I knew there was a five or six pound give on both sides that were happening, right? But we had almost 80% of people were hitting the goal at the time and so it was very compelling and the reality is that most people who work out for six weeks straight want to keep working out and so that's why the offer worked.
(16:43) It got people really motivated in the short term but then it was like hey listen Cindy, you've lost 14 pounds. That's amazing. You told me your goal is 50 though. Yeah. Okay. Well, it's going to take longer than that, right? Yeah, I know it's going to take longer than that. Cool. Then let's just get you going for a year and actually get you there for good, right? So, it's very easy transition even though people came in for a defined in program on the front end.
(17:00) Now, the beauty of this particular offer was that compared to the rest of the industry, everyone else was giving free trials, free months, or low barrier offers like $21 for 20 days, things like that. And so when they were trying to market against me, I was making $500 in the in the first transaction. And then 48 hours later, I was selling another $200, $300 of supplements.
(17:18) I had so much more cash up front. I could wildly outspend them. For them, they have $21. Okay, basically nothing. And then they have to wait 3 weeks to convert into a normal membership price of 99, $1.99 a month. And it would take them three months to just get what I got in the first transaction. And because of that, I was able to massively outspend them.
(17:36) And so by doing that play, I was able to dominate markets. And the beauty of the guarantee, the way I had it structured was one, obviously there was a goal and if they won their money back by hitting the goal, they had it. It was straight up they have they have the money back. Um sometimes some like later on we started doing it as credit saying, "Hey, this is credit, so we'll credit it back to what any other services. You just have to disclaim in the advertising, all that stuff. Obey the laws of your area, whatever." Now, beyond that, what it
(17:59) enabled me to do is do something that is one of my favorite closes ever, which is the best case, worst case close. And so I'd be like, "Hey Cindy, let's just zoom out for a second." Best case scenario, you change your life forever. You finally get in shape. You find a community of people and you actually stick with this for life. That's best case. Worst case scenario, you work out for 6 weeks basically for free.
(18:17) You tell me I suck and I give you your money back. You have nothing to lose except the only thing that is more guaranteed than that is that if you leave, you're definitely not going to get to where you want to go. So what do you want to do? Like it was a risk-free move. And that closed a lot.
(18:34) So, all of this stuff is what helped me get to $100,000, multiple $100,000 in revenue the first year. Now, I also had a decent amount of profit that was left over. But the thing is is that I didn't take that money out of the business. I left the cash in the business and then when I opened my second location, I took that cash in my first location and basically spent it all on the second, right? It cost me 250 grand for the second location, which was a big mistake.
(18:53) I way over spent because my ego was tied to it. But the thing is is that it it took years before I actually ended up act taking money out of the business and putting it in my personal bank account. The richest I've ever felt, which I talk about in the last story of this book, um was when I put $100,000 into my bank account, um from the launch business.
(19:14) And so I kept doubling down on new location, new location, new location, new location. And so I felt like I was living on like a razor's edge because like I basically had I was really asset rich and cash poor. I just had all these locations, all this equipment, all this payroll due every month.
(19:29) And so there was cash in all the bank accounts of the businesses, but like nothing in mind. And I think if I could do it over again, I would have said, "Dude, like what's the rush? Like why are you rushing? Like take money out. Like get yourself set up so you can breathe." And so I think that I was running on such high like stress at all times that it it dramatically impacted my ability to make good decisions because like there is no finish line. There's no like there's no award I get.
(19:54) Like it like it's not like there's a network effect in gyms. Like you just have to keep executing really well for a very long period of time and then eventually you can build something that has hundreds and thousands of locations, but like you still have to run a really good business.
(20:11) And I just had this artificial sense of rush because I was trying to prove myself to everyone in my head that didn't even care about me anyways. Now the interesting thing with this whole challenge thing is that it took me a while to get good at it. So the first challenge I ever ran only 15% of people lost the weight. And what's interesting is that between then and you know a year later, multiple years later, like we were almost 80%.
(20:28) But like fundamentally we still had more or less the same workouts and the meal plans that I provided in terms of the calorie restrictions etc were basically the same thing. And so I was like what was the difference? And so the difference was I actually learned how to operate a business.
(20:46) Number two is I really leaned on to accountability, which is like make reminding people to show up to the gym, reminding people to follow their meal plans, telling people they have to weigh in on a regular basis, making sure they're documenting that publicly. Like I started doing all these little things, right? There was no one thing that made it just like every time we just got better and better and better.
(20:58) So even though the stakes were there with the money, that actually was enough to motivate some people, but the reality is that like I should have just made it easier. So I like took the meal plans and I made them colorcoded and I made them uh they didn't have to weigh anything. They didn't have to count calories.
(21:15) Like I learned a lot of things that made it more accessible to people who were just getting started because I was starting as I was starting with beginners but I was an advanced, you know, fitness person at the time. I had multiple state records. Like I was like I was hardcore in it but like the people I was serving were not me and it took me a minute to learn that. And I'll tell you how I figured this out. So I remember freaking out uh near the end of the very first challenge I ever ran. I called my dad up. He's a physician.
(21:33) And I was like I think I'm crashing people's hormones and metabolism. Maybe I'm I'm restricting their calories too much. that's why they're they're not losing weight. And any experienced doctor will tell you, he's like, "Oh, they're just not adhering." And I was like, "No, it's obviously not that. It's obviously like some sort of scientific thing." And obviously, he was right.
(21:50) It was just no one was no one was following it, right? And so, um, one of the things that I learned, and this is good for anybody who has clients who have to do anything to get a result. So, it doesn't matter what you sell, but if you have a service where a customer has to take action in order to see an outcome, what I learned was asking specific questions.
(22:06) So, when I would ask people, hey, did you follow everything? In the beginning, they were all like, "Oh, yeah. Follow everything to the tea, 100%." And then I could literally follow that up with, "Okay, so how many days out of seven did you eat all three meals exactly to plan with nothing else?" And they'd be like, "Oh, I mean, at least three days a week." And I'd be like, "You just said that you followed it 100%.
(22:26) " And then the next question was, "How many days out of seven did you eat all three and nothing else?" They were like, "Oh, yeah, only three." Right? And so I got more specific about it like how many times did you have three and two shakes or whatever and they would be like oh that's what I had. Now if anybody who's like listening to this is like ah fitness stuff.
(22:43) Point being is that ask specific questions and you'll get much more specific answers. Now the sixth thing that kind of got me to that $100,000 plus was sell the vacation not the plane flight. So I want to give you a visual on this because I think it's really important like this when I understood how this worked for sales it really changed I mean how much money I made.
(23:06) So, what happens is, let's say somebody's here, right? They're sad because they're like, "Ah, I'm sad and my eyes are really weird. I look like a cyclops." Uh, right. I'd be sad if I look like that. Right? And they want to get over here, right? They want to be happy version of them who's got eyes that are evenly spaced and has a smiley face. Now, there's going to be some process of getting them here.
(23:24) Right? Now, what happens is most salespeople will talk about all of the steps of getting here, right? That's what they're going to talk about. And the thing is is that that's like telling somebody, "Hey, I want you to go on this vacation." And so, what's going to be required is you're going to have to wake up at the crack of dawn. You're going to have to pack your stuff the night before.
(23:42) You're going to have to be stressed out to wait in line. You have to pull your ID out. They're going to weigh it. You might have to pay an extra bill, right? And then once you get uh to the plane, they're going to make you sit for another hour. And then you're going to get called up like cattle and put into the and put into the the compartment of the plane and you're going to have somebody sneezing and coughing next to you.
(23:59) Of course, there's going to be a baby on the plane. They're going to be crying the whole time. The food's going to be terrible and you might get jetlagged. There's going to be a delay for sure. And by the way, did I mention the layover? Yeah, you're going to have to do it all again another time in order to get your final location. Now, once you get there, you're actually not going to be there. You're have to get You get the point here, right? Painful.
(24:17) That's what most people's sales sound like. But instead, if I just said, "Hey, you're here." You want to be in Maui. Let me tell you about Maui. And let me tell you how it's not like Baltimore. So Baltimore, it's like it's it's it's raining here, right? Oh, that's rain. That's like a looks like an octopus or jellyfish. Anyways, that's rain. All right. So, it's raining here, right? Like rain.
(24:42) You got your little umbrella. Very sad, right? It's terrible here. What we want to talk about is the pain of their current situation. pain increases their their desire to change. So think about it this way. You want to sell at the point of greatest deprivation.
(25:02) So that's why like when someone's in pain is when they want to go to a doctor, right? You want to solve that. And so we want to remind them of the pain. So you want to talk about them where they're currently at, all the problems that exist. Then we say, "Cool. Well, let me tell you about Maui. Maui's got beautiful clear water. It's got white white sand, very fine. It's almost like powder when you're stepping into it. You're going to have poolside service and oceanside service depending on what you want.
(25:21) And you're going to have a cabana boy who's got little drinks with the little umbrellas in it. And you're going to be sipping there having a time your life creating memories that you will have for until you die. And the thing is is that this vacation isn't just going to pay dividends when you're there. You're going to enjoy it, but you're going to enjoy it two other times. Every day leading up to it, you're going to be looking forward to it. It's going to make every day better.
(25:38) And then afterwards, you're gonna be able to look back at those pictures and reexperience it. And so, it's not even about the vacation. It's about something that you're going to be able to use and think about for the rest of your life. Right? Notice what I didn't talk about. The plane flight, the TSA, the guy, the baby, you know, smoking cigarettes next to you.
(25:54) I don't know what this baby's doing, but he's doing something crazy. And so, the point is is that you want to focus on the pain of their current and then what the experience of the result will be like. And then them signing up is the process of getting there. Now, this part's key. Number seven was the role of bonuses and discounts. Okay.
(26:12) Now, in the beginning, and I think I learned this really early on, and so I've never been a discounter, when it comes to my core product. Now, very different than saying like, I'm going to peel a piece off. It's going to be a lead magnet. That's a different situation. But if someone wants me to discount my core service, the answer is always no, because we don't negotiate with price terrorists.
(26:30) So, what do you do instead? So, I'll give you two different things that have worked really well for me. So, number one is that if somebody asks for a discount, what I would prefer to do is just add a bonus. If somebody asks for a discount, the first answer I usually say is, "Well, I could do it for more." Right? And a lot of times that gets people to buy.
(26:48) Now, if they still don't want to buy, they say, "Okay, how about this?" Because maybe they're like, "I literally can't." Like, "Okay, can you refer me three friends? If you refer me three friends, I'll give you that discount, which is different because it changes the term.
(27:00) " So, if someone else finds out, hey, you gave Susie sign up for $400 and you made me sign up for 500. I'm like, "Oh, dude, bring three friends. I'll give you the $100 bucks right now." And they're like, "Oh, she didn't say that." I'm like, "Yeah, I changed the terms, right?" And so you can use discounts as bartering tools to have them advertise for you. So like I'll give you 100 bucks off if you also make reviews on all these platforms or do other things.
(27:17) So basically any kind of discount I'll have my terms will change to all the advertising they will allow me to do which is worth more to me than whatever the discount is. Now if somebody presents with a specific obstacle and I'll give you the actual story. So the first time I realized this there was this lady business professional had the money. She was like the money's not a problem. I was like okay. She said the issue is I travel a lot for work.
(27:36) And she's like, "So, how am I going to be able to stick with a plan when I'm not here?" And she was like, "Do you have a travel meal plan?" And I was like, "Well, I don't." And she's like, "Well, that's kind of a kind of a dealbreaker for me." And I was like, "Okay, what if I made you a travel meal plan so that every time you travel, you know how to order at the restaurant uh so you can eat out and actually like, you know, keep with this when you're gone?" And she was like, "Oh, if you can do that for me, I'm in." And so I made that thing for that one lady. And then
(27:59) for every other person after that, when they'd come in and say, "Hey, uh, what happens if I travel or I have to go somewhere for work or I have this vacation in the middle? What do I do?" I'd be like, "Oh, I'll give you the travel plan." And then boom, the obstacle is done. And so what happened is I started collecting kind of all of these obstacles that people would present with for the reasons that they wouldn't buy.
(28:18) And then I ended up making things. So I made a budget guide meal plan. So it's like, I can afford the thing, but I can't afford the food. I'm like, "Oh, what are you spending on food right now?" Cool. this budget groceries is cost less than 40 bucks a week and you'll be able to to stick to the calories and lose the weight. They're like, "Oh, that's amazing. I might even save money on this plan." And they're like, "What if I'm on the go?" I'm like, "Oh, I've got the shakes guide.
(28:35) " "Oh, what if I uh like what if I don't know what to eat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner?" "Okay, well, not only will you follow the plan, I'll actually give you specific breakfast, lunches, and dinners that you can make with zero prep.
(28:48) " Oh, what about working out when I'm away? Oh, that's why I have my while you're away workout guide, right? What about if I can't make it in the gym because of time constraints? Can I work out at home? Yep. I had my at home workout guide. And so basically every single thing that people would present with, I would take the one-time effort of making a beautiful solution for them and they were like, "Wow, you went above and beyond.
(29:07) " But then I took that templated solution and I stuck it in my stack so that when somebody would talk to me and they'd bring up an obstacle, be like, "Oh, don't worry. Something like this. Would that help?" And they're like, "Oh my god, that'd be amazing." And so I wouldn't in a one-on-one selling situation, different than group sales.
(29:19) I would have my big stack of bonuses in my back pocket so that if they presented with it, I would just match their objection with the bonus that would overcome it. So, this was a this was a pretty terrible thing in terms of lessons, which was uh overspending. So, what made my first location kind of like so successful was that I was there and I, you know, went above and beyond for customers and I tried to, you know, make everyone happy.
(29:45) And people could tell that I wasn't like rolling in money, you know, like, you know, I had uh I had these sandbags that like there's nice sandbags you can buy that are like fitness sandbags. I went to Home Depot and just bought sandbags and then just tape them with duct tape and people just like would carry these like babies around of of of sand, right? And um so when my second location happened, I saved all this money up and I put $250,000 in the second location.
(30:03) So like I spent what is this eight times or whatever is more on my second location than my first location. And here's the crazy part. It made the same amount of money as my first location. And so like it was way worse returns on capital than my first one. And the thing is is that I didn't actually understand what made my product good, what made people actually like my stuff.
(30:23) And so people weren't coming to the gym for fancy top tier equipment. They weren't coming for granite countertops and a glass wall, which is what I did. My glass wall at my second location was almost the same price as my entire first location. What they were coming for was the accountability and the quality of the training, quality of the experience, the people they liked.
(30:39) And so that's when it I mean it took me $250,000 to learn this lesson. Um, which is that I had to understand like what's the job to be done? What's the job that I'm actually accomplishing for the customer, right? Or for like what does my product or service deliver? And so for us it was community and accountability. Like people are very lonely. People want to feel like they belong and obviously they want to do things that are good for themselves.
(30:56) But what I realized over time is that the people who stuck with it, a lot of them didn't like dramatically change after they've done their weight loss challenges, but they kept coming back again and again and they just liked it because they wanted to look good, feel good.
(31:08) They just wanted to just like feel good, see their friends, listen to some music, you know, get a little sweat on, and then they'd go have their margarita Tuesdays or whatever. And I used to get really upset about that, but I was like, but it was because I didn't understand what we were actually doing. what we're really doing was providing a place for people to like get away from home and get away from work. It was like that third spot.
(31:26) I think Starbucks talks about that like what's that third location like for us the gym was that I think the only way you can really discover this is by actually talking to your customers and just asking them and say like what what need does this for fulfill for you? Like what problem does this solve? Like where does this fit in your life? And I think listening qualitatively to the feedback, you'd find out like and the key when you're asking these things is you don't want to lead them on.
(31:49) You don't want to say like are we the third location for between your house and your, you know, like your job. Are we that thing that fills your community hole up? It's like no, that's not what you're asking. You're just saying, you want to keep it super open because you want them to tell you. And what that has helped me with is where I allocate my time in terms of reinvestment in the service or product to make it better because it's not better in my eyes, it has to be better in their eyes. Cuz I spent way too long obsessing over like the periodization of the training and like and I completely
(32:14) disregarded the music but like the music mattered more to people than like the training like in terms of the actual workouts. Now the quality of the trainer different but like how many reps and sets they were doing, how much volume they were doing. Like they didn't care at all. I mean shoot half the time they'd skip a workout or two.
(32:31) So like the periodization was irrelevant, right? But I was so obsessed with that cuz I was into it. Yeah. And I think I think the vast majority of business owners spend a huge amount of time solving problems that aren't problems. And so it's like you completely and excellently solve something that only you think is a problem. And so that's where like this tremendous waste of resources happens. Now let me tell you the next big lesson I had, which was proof.
(32:52) So, what I did was, and I recommend this to every brick-and-mortar business owner, is if you have a sales area or a sales room, these are examples that I have of before and after pictures. Obviously, you need permissions and all that stuff from people. Make sure you're following the law, but just showing overwhelming social proof.
(33:10) And so, right now, if you have Yelp or you have Google or whatever, there's going to be all these five stars you've gotten. People have left you reviews. Well, what a waste for them to only live there. So, screenshot them. Go to the dollar store. buy $1 frames and then frame them all. And so when somebody's in your sales office, if all they see around you is before and after pictures of people saying you're great, it's hard for them to be like, well, is this place legit? You're like, I mean, yeah. And then I ask, and this is the question, I this is the question
(33:34) I would ask. I'd say, well, how much proof would you need to see in order to believe? And then the followup question is, and if they like didn't, you know, be like, and is that reasonable? Because you tell me when. Is it that one? Like one, two, three, just tell me when. Five, six, seven, eight. Just tell me when it's good. Nine, 10.
(33:51) They'll be like, "No, stop. I get it." I'm like, "Right." So, like, at some point, it probably isn't about that. It's about something you're afraid of. So, what are you afraid of? Right now, I'm back in the sale and I'm actually dealing with the real thing, the reason behind the reason, not the easy one that's a smoke screen that they're just putting out to not buy. Mostly because, let's be real, someone at least for a gym, they're scared.
(34:08) They're afraid they're going to get made fun of. They're afraid they're going to slip. They're afraid they look stupid, right? That's the big fears that people I didn't even realize this when I It took me a long time to realize that like these are actual fears for people. And it was weird for me because I love the gym.
(34:20) So I'm like, everyone should love the gym. But it wasn't like that at all. Yeah. And so I I made a whole video about this like required viewing for business owners. You can go check it out. And inside the video, I basically talk about a flywheel that every business has to have. And I real I learned it with this business, which is that you're going to get customers in the door, step one.
(34:37) You're going to get those customers results, step two. And then step three, you need to use those results to get you more customers. And so that's the flywheel that every business needs to build. And so you have moments in your customer experience or your product experience where customers are going to get these wow moments, right? Or ideally, right? And you want to be there at those moments to capture their reactions so that you can feed that into your marketing machine, right? And so there's there's the milestones along the way and then obviously the end goal. And so for us, obviously with
(35:05) challenges, we it was easy to be like way in, we out, big moment, awesome picture, video, was this great? Yeah. Leave us a review, fantastic. And so trying to engineer that into your customer experience primo way to get more customers and enhance your sales. I'm going to finish that by saying proof system and displaying.
(35:23) So it's both both collection and displaying of the proof. Now the next one uh was partners. Now man, it's taken me a very long time to learn learn my lessons with partners. All right. So I have this really nice acronym uh for partners I'm going to share with you.
(35:41) So if you want a partner to join your team, they should they should accomplish one of the team acronyms, which is mean either they have time that you don't have, they've got expertise that you don't have, they've got assets that you don't have, or they've got money that you don't have.
(35:59) So assets would be like they've got a brand, they've got a following, they've got an audience, they might have a machine. I mean, whatever. They have something. They have a distribution base of of customers, they have a network of affiliates, whatever. They have something that you don't have. They have expertise. They have a skill that you don't have. You can't do this without having the skill.
(36:15) They can work and you're predisposed or they've got money and you need it, right? But fundamentally, every single partnership should have one or more of these things that they're bringing to the table that's complimentary. If the worst business partnerships in the world is when two people have the same expertise get into business together because they're friends. It's like the recipe for bad partnership.
(36:33) Two lessons on partnerships beyond the team framework. Number one is that if one of you is the working partner and somebody else is the outside partner who's maybe funding it, you need to figure out if you're going to have some sort of salary to live on. This was a mistake that I made and I basically lived without taking a salary from the business cuz I brought in partners and they weren't taking a salary, but I was the one working in the business and they weren't. And so I basically lived without taking an income
(36:58) for two years. And so the reason that I'm so sensitive to cheapness and personal finance is because like what I made in the first five or six months of me being in business is what I lived on for the next two years. And so I lived on like $30,000 a year or less. And that's why I was so sensitive to it.
(37:17) The idea is make sure that you have some reasonable compensation if you're going to be the manager of the business because long-term you need somebody else who's going to be the manager in yourstead. So that's a cost that the business is going to have to incur regardless and you're doing a job in addition to being the owner. So that's like there's you want to make sure that that's clear.
(37:33) Are you doing a job in the business different than the owner? That's only going to be in the situations when somebody's funding your thing. All right, point one. The second point is that the equity that you give away in the beginning is the most expensive. And so to the degree that you possibly can, hold out on giving equity away early. Now, if you have to bring people in and you absolutely need them, then sure, that's that's part of the game.
(37:56) But I it's just like it's so often that someone's like, "Cool, here's the pie. There's two of us. Boom. Here's half." Right? You don't always have to split things evenly between the number of people. There's different value of skills. There's different value of experience. There's knowledge set. So like you can bring two people in and each of them can have 5% and then you have 90.
(38:13) Like the the the slices of the pie don't necessarily need to be the same. And a big variable they have there is are they taking a paycheck or not, right? And so it's a lot of this has to come down to one big word, risk. Who's taking on the most risk? And so typically that is how the pie is sliced. So number 11 was owners. You're like, how is that different than partners? Let me explain.
(38:33) So every brickandmortar, now I' have a lot of experience with this now, but every brickandmortar business that I know that's been scaled privately, not franchised, which actually still follows the same law, but that scales privately with one or, you know, a couple owners that own everything. is that they figure out that every brickandmortar location typically needs to do a profit share.
(38:56) They need to have somebody that they have they have they have a what feels like a stake in the location. So if you look at like Chick-fil-A for example, they have their location operators and those operators have a percentage of the profit from each location. Now they're not the majority owners. They don't have controlling, but they can run the day-to-day operations. And so basically every brickandmortar business that I have seen scale has this thing.
(39:20) Now some people ask the question, well how much do you give in profit share? I'll tell you how I come to it. I think how much would someone need to make that has the level of skill required to thrive in this position? And so let's say that I I think that the skills that are required here would require five years of experience and $150,000 a year. Okay.
(39:40) So I'm going to say the ontarget earnings OT all right is 150k. Okay. So, what I'd probably do is say, "All right, well, what does my average location make?" And let's say my average location makes $250,000 in profit. All right. Well, I don't want to give $250,000 in profit straight to the That doesn't make any sense for you as an owner, right? So, then what do I do? So, I would probably do something like this. You get 75K as a base. So, 50%.
(40:08) And the other 50% which would be $75,000 would mean that you would get let's say 10 whatever 12.5%. I don't know what the math is here. 12.5% of the profit from the location. Now, if a location does really well and does $350,000, then all of a sudden this 12.5% is even more. So, now they're at 185 or whatever.
(40:31) Now, if they underperform and let's say they're at 100K, well, then they would only get an extra 12.5K, right? And so, then they'd only make whatever that is, $87,000. And so this still keeps them very invested as an operator for the location and feeling the topline and bottom line impacts of what it costs to run the business.
(40:49) And I want this person to be like I want their picture on the wall and be like this is John's location, right? And this is where I love this from a long-term perspective because this can become a very easy career path for people. So people who are kind of low like if you have a business that requires low or medium level skill, somebody can come in do an amazing job and they're like what's my long-term career path here? It's like, well, if you do an awesome job, I'm happy to put you in our newest location that's across town. So, if you want to start that one
(41:11) up, you can start here, but you got to prove yourself over 3 to 5 years, right? And so, that way, they get to know the business. They get to know how it's operated well, and then you can pull them over. And then, this kind of gives you this organic growth where people have ownership in their futures.
(41:23) And so, this took me a really long time to learn. And this was a mistake that I can now tell you because now having looked at a lot, and we obviously have chains of locations inside of acquisition.com, you want to have this model. At least in my opinion, that's Alex's two cents. And if you're curious how this math works, I'm going to spell it out really easily for you right now.
(41:41) You have your on target earning of what you think the person would make if they do a normal job. Like you're not going to fire them, they're fine. You then say half of that's going to be base and the other half would be for medium performance. That gets them to the medium outcome. Now, if they have exceptional performance, whatever that percentage was to equal half of the base or half the extra half of their of the ontarget earnings, then they would get more if it goes up. And if it goes down, then that percentage is going to be less.
(42:04) So they're going to be below their own target earnings. That's the earnings for the person. So I didn't do this and it was really hard. And if I could do it again, that's what I would have done. Number 12. This is a big one. Nail it before you scale it. So this goes to the whole rush thing, right? I was in this massive rush to do what? I have no idea.
(42:21) I just everything was like everything has to happen tomorrow. Everything has to happen tomorrow. And I ended up making a ton of mistakes, not getting locations perfectly situated before starting the next one. And so basically like I'm still selling at location one when I'm starting location two, right? Just not smart, right? It should have been like, okay, how do we get this so that our churn's really low? How do we get it so that's continuing to compound year over year over year? How do we make sure that we're absolute full capacity?
(42:44) How do we know that like people are selling and marketing on their own without me? Once that occurs and I let it sit for six months and it's still growing straight, then I can maybe start the next one, right? And so if you're like thinking through this, my litmus test for this is that number one, you shouldn't care about your second location before the first one can run without you. Period.
(43:04) Number two, don't go to a new one until the old one is growing without you for 6 months straight. That's my rule of thumb. Six months straight of growth without you doing it. Now, to be clear, a lot of business owners or small business owners, for local business especially, are like, "Oh, no. This thing runs without me." No, no, no, no, no.
(43:21) I'm not saying like, "Oh, uh, you don't show up to the gym, therefore it runs without you." There's many things that are required in a business. You're the operator. You don't necessarily train the sessions. You don't necessarily like do the billing, but like you're still required to make decisions and and deal with customers, all that stuff. No, we need somebody else who completely encapsulates that business.
(43:38) And here's the the deal. This this goes on number uh with number 11. Here's how you have the conversation. So, John, I want you to I want you to be the uh the operator for this location. You're going to have a profit share. Your on target earnings is twice what you're currently making. And here's the stick. Cool. You've been working here for 5 years. I want to give you that opportunity. Okay. So, here's the deal.
(43:56) You're going to make 10% of the profit of this location on one condition. Get it? Yes. Here's the condition. This doesn't ring. That's the deal. So, let me explain. Let's role play this. A pipe breaks in the middle of a session. It's leaking out of the ceiling. What do you do? Call a plumber? Right? So, skip the call me part and just call the plumber. Okay.
(44:15) Let's try it again. Let's say someone has a heart attack on the floor. What are you going to do? Not call you. Correct. Now, someone has a heart attack on the floor, I probably would call you. But for the purpose of our illustration, what would you do first? Call 911 because that's what I'm going to do, right? So, just think one extra step and then do that thing.
(44:33) And you have permission up to $1,000 of cost to not have to call me. All right? And so, you want to make sure though to be clear, you want to give So, this is a good one for for everybody to write down is that you want to pair responsibility with authority. So, when you only have one or the other, it creates problems.
(44:50) If someone has authority, no responsibility, you have an right? I just tell people what people to do, but they not responsible for anything. It's just people just go sticking their nose in other people's business. On the other hand, this is far more common. Business owners give someone the responsibility but not the authority. They see you're responsible for all this stuff. And they're like, "Okay, well, I need to do X do XYZ.
(45:01) " And they're like, "No, no, no, no. Uh, you can't do that without my permission." It's like, "Well, then they're just handcuffed. They can't do anything, right?" So, you have to give authority that is equal to the responsibility. If you think that 90% of problems can get solved for $500 or less, then give it to them.
(45:14) If you know that customer escalations, there's a problem with a customer, you say, "Hey, up to 100% of what a customer uh spent with us in the last month, you're able to spend on discretionary for people who are upset. So, if someone spends $100 with us this month, you can spend 100% of their $100 to make them happy and not have a bad experience, right? if they're, you know, and this is where like somebody has a new kid, someone's parent died, someone's car breaks down, whatever it is, like that going that extra mile and using this kind of discretionary fund is what you want to
(45:38) empower a location owner operator to have so they can actually make decisions about you. And so the nail before you scale it concept works across all industries. All right? So like if you have a software company, if you're losing customers and turning them out, why would you scale it? Like you don't just like pour more water into a leaky bucket.
(45:55) Why would you do that? If you have an agency and you're, you know, you're like, "Oh, look, we're we're we finally have ads that are converting for us." Yeah, cool. Great. That's step one. Don't scale them anymore. See why customers are leaving. And if customers are consistently leaving, maybe you're serving the wrong customers.
(46:07) And maybe you shouldn't scale because you're just going to create a churn factory, right? And the thing is is that the vast majority of businesses are this. They especially small businesses.
(46:18) And this is actually the difference between small businesses, big businesses, is that small businesses become medium-sized businesses typically by just spending a ton more on marketing and sales because they learned how to do it. But they never figured out how to keep customers. And if you never figure that out when you're small, you're definitely not going to have it when you're when you're rich, when you're big.
(46:29) All right? Because it's easier to fix it when you're small. And there's going to be natural degradation of things as things scale. And so if you can't do when you're small, it's even harder when you're big. And so you want to nail it first. And then as you scale it, keep fixing it so it stays nailed. Yeah. And a great test for that 6 months walk away period from 0.1 is just take a vacation.
(46:47) Take a one-mon vacation. See what happens. You'll be able to see what breaks. It's actually a great test. So, let me give you let me give you uh my my lesson number 13 I learned from the gyms is unscalable beginnings. So, when I started my first location, Huntington Beach, I had one PT client who paid me like $4,000 a month.
(47:04) And it's cuz they trained 5 days a week and it was like hour and a half or two hour long sessions. And so, it was 10 hours a week of PT basically guaranteed that I would do with them. And so, it made me a significant amount every month. And I basically just lived on that. Now, is that part of the model? No.
(47:20) But I did it because that's like what allowed me to be more aggressive with the expansion of the business. I could take take all the cash that come in, buy new equipment, fix things, whatever, you know, hire more people.
(47:33) And so there are some things that you're going to do in the beginning that will not scale with the business. And that's okay. So you just want to make sure that your nail it portion doesn't include the unscalable parts that I still think you should absolutely consider doing to make the whole process a lot easier on yourself. And so it's like if you have your core business, fine.
(47:51) If you have five five clients who pay you more personalized attention for stuff so you can like live on that money, part of you is going to be like, "Man, I should just do this." And maybe you should, but if you're trying to build an asset that has value independent of your time, then this is what we're building. So, I just like I wouldn't. Yes, is it a distraction, but being poor is even bigger distraction.
(48:08) And so, it's really like the lesser of which evil, right? If you're like, "Man, it's just I'm so stressed about payroll and stuff, but like if you have this other cash flow thing, and to be clear, this isn't woman in in the in the red dress. I'm talking like you're not building another business.
(48:21) It's like you're just straight selling time so that at a higher, you know, a higher ticket for your expertise or something so that you can build this asset. So, I'm okay with that. And that sounds like it's contrary to the woman in the red dress, but we're not building two businesses.
(48:33) You're just accepting very high ticket clients that you can on a one-on-one basis, not building a separate business, minimizing the time requirement. And so, for me, with my personal training client, I did in the middle of the day. So, I like it it worked out fine for me. I'd finish my morning sessions. I would have a couple hours. I would do two hours uh you know with him and then I'd start my evening session.
(48:52) So I basically just started that as my my evening sessions and that's just what allowed Alex to eat Chipotle. And if you're like wait I thought you ate the expired food. I did that too but sometimes I wait to it to expire. So I had to eat Choleot in the meantime.
(49:04) All right so this next one's really big especially if you have a team which basically anybody who has a business eventually has a team is that doing is not the same as teaching. So it's one thing to be able to sell. It's another thing to be able to teach to sell. It's one thing to be able to train, another thing to be able to teach and train. One thing to be able to run ads, another thing to be able to teach people to run ads.
(49:22) And so I had this kind of ego thing where I loved being the most valuable player, right? I love being able to come in and save the day, put the team on my back, and everyone's like Rocky, Rock, you know, whatever, right? And that was something that handicapped me. And so I wanted to be the best salesperson, but what a terrible thing to want if you want to have a business. And so I had to shift my identity to being I want to be the best sales teacher. I want to be this best marketing teacher.
(49:41) I want to be the best operations teacher, right? And by doing that, it shifted how I saw what winning looks like. And so before this, it was like, oh, they went two for six today. I could go in and close five out of six. Okay, cool. Well, that means that you suck as a teacher, not that you're great as a sales guy.
(49:58) And so, you have to basically level up your game and think this is the new identity that I have to be. And this took me this took me a long time to learn. And I'll tell you the first time that this was like very real for me, is that um I went home for for Christmas. Uh this is like the first year of the gym and I was very afraid uh to do that and I had trained uh these girls who had sold tanning before and so I taught them how to sell the challenge and I remember when I was driving I remember where I was I was driving on the road to to go back to my actual house where I lived when I grew
(50:26) up and I get this phone call and they're like yeah you know the day ended and I was like how'd you do and they were like oh we had uh you know we had we had five people show uh sold two and I was like you sold them though like credit card like it ran like the whole thing. They were like, "Yeah, one was paid in full, the other was a split pay." And I was like, "Hold on." So today, $750 came in.
(50:45) Like it pro it said successful next to it. And they were like, "Yeah." They were like actively like, "Why is this guy being so weird?" And I ended up pulling the car over and I remember it was like one of the few times that I had like a real big emotional like experience. Uh one of the few times ever.
(51:02) And I almost got like teared up because it was it was the first moment where I realized like I wasn't the one who was going to have to make every dollar in this business. And it was the first moment where I realized the value of transferring a skill to somebody else because until then I just wanted to be MVP. I just wanted to be the best trainer, the best sales guy, best whatever. But as soon as I gave it someone else, it was like it was like I tasted freedom.
(51:19) And once I had that, I was like, I'm going to get great at this. And I think a big part of honestly the stuff that you guys see today with YouTube and the books and things like that was because I shifted my perspective from being like it's one thing to learn. I have to learn it. I have to learn it so that I can teach it rather than I want to learn it so that I can be the best person at I don't think I'm the best at basically anything.
(51:38) If I can be one of the best at teaching the thing, then I can help thousands and millions of people and that's a much higher leverage skill. So the next thing kind of bolts onto that which is lesson 15 for me was simple. All right, simple scales fancy fails. All right, now it's like okay well duh. All right, but let me talk about this within the context of systems and and training.
(51:57) So, a lot of people have these very, very complex sales systems, and I honestly just try and cut more and more things out of the sales stuff that I teach because I want it to be something that someone can immediately pick up. And so, the whole like closer framework came out of just trying to make this as simple as possible. Clarify why they're here when they come in.
(52:16) Label them with the problem to show that you listen. Ask them. You overview the past experience, their past pain. What have they tried so far? Then sell the vacation. Tell them about our thing. Make the offer. or if they say no, explain to where their concerns once they buy, then reinforce the decision, tell them they did a good job. That's it.
(52:33) It's all we're doing, right? And so I used to have all these like really complex things that I try like and it became really hard for people to learn. And then I was like, okay, I just need this so that somebody who has no idea how to sell can go through this thing and then be able to sell afterwards. And I remember when I started launching gyms that the sales training I had in in total was like an hour and 15 minutes, the whole thing.
(52:52) And what's crazy is that that sales training came from the intention of like people have to watch this and at the end to be able to close. And what's so interesting is that I see like lots of sales trainings that are like sold and things like that on the internet. They're they're you know they're 100 hours long. But I had a sales training that was like just do this.
(53:08) Don't do anything else. Just do this. And I only had to get them to understand seven steps in this process. And if they could understand the seven steps, they could close. And so I would encourage you to first think what is the absolute minimum required in order to close this out.
(53:26) What is the absolute minimum required in order to make a great training session, right? And then try and boil it down to the core components rather than make it complicated because the complexity piece again makes you feel important like you're so advanced when in reality like there's probably fewer things that matter than you think. All right, so this is a very kind of technical advanced thing that I learned from the gyms which is that you want zero cost upsells.
(53:43) Okay, so what does that mean? So I realized early on that people would come into the gym and then I'd sell them service, right? But they also would want other things after that. They would want apparel, they would want apps, they would want food, they would want supplements. Like there's all these other things, right? And so I realized that it would cost me about 200, well later 200 earlier cost me less, but let's call it $100, $200 to acquire a customer. Okay.
(54:07) The question I then asked myself was, is there something that I can sell them that cost me no time? Because selling service costs me time, right? there's something I could sell that cost me no extra effort that could recoup that original cost. And the answer was yes. And so if you sell a service, I think one of the easiest things you can do is upsell products that go with the service that you just make your margin on and you can liquidate your ad cost up front. And so for me, I sold supplements.
(54:32) I'd sell $2 $300 supplements to every person and the margin I made on the supplements was usually enough to cover the cost of all of my advertising every month. So basically, I would just recover all my advertising bill with my supplements so I could spend whatever I wanted to get customers because then all of my service revenue was basically gravy on top.
(54:48) And so the goal that I would like don't think, oh that doesn't work for my business. Ask it differently. Think how could I make something like this work for my business. So like if I have a yoga studio that's like fine, sell yoga blots, sell mats, sell sell leggings, whatever. Because they're going to want that stuff.
(55:00) There's always going to be a couple other things that someone's going to want when you have a service typically. And if you're like, "Well, I can't immediately think of something." Fine.
(55:11) Then give yourself more than immediately to think about it because you only have to figure out one or two things and it can change your business forever. Also, pro tip, if you want, you can uh you can sell a guarantee. So guarantees don't have to be free. You can sell a guarantee. So you can sell your normal services. And if for an extra 10% will guarantee this people will buy a guarantee, and guarantees are basically zero extra cost if they don't take it.
(55:28) And so it's like only one out of 10 people who buys a guarantee ends up uh taking me up on it. It's like, okay, well then 90% of the time it's just profit. Pro tip. And you can also charge more than 10% obviously. 17. I learned the power of what I called internal plays. All right, so internal plays are basically internal promotions that you run to your existing customers and list.
(55:48) And so one of the things I realized is that customers get bored of things. And so you just need to sell them more stuff. And so I would say, okay, you know, we have our normal gym membership, but we're going to run a big booty boot camp. We're going to run a buns and guns. We're going to run a sex, you know, break, you know, get your sexy back, whatever, right? And you laugh, but this is this is this is how it was, right? I did an abs and arms program for dudes. And the thing is is it sold it worked great.
(56:10) But here was the best part is that I remember the first time I did this was Big Booty Boot Camp. So Sam, the guy that I that I signed up for, said, "Hey, uh, send these emails." So I was like, "All right, so cool." So I sent these emails that were about Big Booty Boot Camp. And the emails all of a sudden like came back. People were like, "I'm in. I'm in. I'm in on my on my email." I was like, "Holy cow." And I got 30 people to spend 300 bucks.
(56:29) made $9,000 which was huge for me right at the time. Made $9,000 and the crazy thing is it was a six week program and it was only it was a 90minute session once a week. So I got six sessions to $300. I was like and so with 30 people I was able to do six sessions and make $9,000 $1,500 a session.
(56:48) Like that was so much more than the amount of money that I was normally making per session. And so the thing is is that these types of plays are they're just free money. And so what you want to do is I would say have some sort of promotional cadence where like once a quarter, every 12 weeks or so, you run some sort of defined in thing for your customers.
(57:05) And here's the crazy part is that in a business especially like this, like a gym business, the margins historically are like 12 and a half%. That's the average like micro gym margins. It's not a lot. And the average micro gym does like 30 360,000 a year. So the average gym owner is making like 30 to 40,000 a year. Not a lot take home. And they're working like 80 hours a week. And so you might hear $9,000 and be like, "Oh, well that's nothing.
(57:23) " It's like, "Well, 9 time 4 is 36. Do you normally take home 36? Then making another 36 doubles your income. Would you double your income for like a couple emails four times a year? Yeah. So do it right. And so every business has this opportunity is that there's something that you can do a very defined thing.
(57:40) Like there wasn't like Big Booty Boot Camp was one body part, right? And so think about your your business. Whatever you serve, you probably serve the whole body of someone's business. You serve the whole body of their computer. You serve the whole body of their phone, whatever. And then you say, "Cool.
(57:52) So, I'm just going to peel off one portion of that and then say, "Hey, all my customers, any of you want this one thing like really maxed out and 10% or 20% of the customers will be like, "Yeah, I'm interested in that." And then boom. And that thing that you end up selling is actually super high margin. Internal plays are almost all profit. You can run them four times a year. Recommend.
(58:11) Yeah, it's it's all it's basically all profit because you already pay the cost requiring the customer. And so, the only cost is the cost of delivery. So for me for the six sessions if I wanted to like you know charge based on my time right I pay a trainer maybe you know 20 20 back then you know 20 bucks an hour for for 90 minutes I pay $30 times six 180 bucks for n grand 98% margins like what are we talking about like let's do it right like unbelievable and so those opportunities exist you just have to find them yeah if I if I wanted to acquire 30 new customers I would have to pay $6,000 right and so like here That's
(58:45) why this is free money. And most most services have, if you at least have a decently designed business model, your gross margin should be 80% or more. And so if you're running 80% gross margins and you sell something, you make $10,000. You make eight net. That's a great deal.
(59:02) The problem is just all the other costs the business, but all those are fixed already. You don't have to pay cost to car customers. You already have your fixed costs covered. So this is just incremental revenue, which tip typically should be high margin for you. So let me give you a quick one. So here's number 18 is a lot of people and I read this a lot like people have the you know they they write books and they make content and they're like here here's why this thing works.
(59:19) I really try hard and you guys are welcome to call me out on it. I try really hard to not say why things work and I think the reason I do that is because I have no idea and I don't think anyone else does either. So we make postulates. We create these hypotheses why how these work but we have no split tests.
(59:37) We have no no research right? So instead, I have spent almost no time in my life trying to figure out why things work and just figure out a big bag of things that do work. And I just try to recommend those things. And so on my channel, that's pretty much all I spend my time. I was like, "This stuff works. I don't know why it works. I just know that it works." So run an internal play a couple times a year. It'll probably make you more money.
(59:55) If you have upsells, try and have them be zero cost, zero work upsells so that you can just make more money up front, right? If you do it simpler, more people do a good job, right? I like why, I don't know. But when you have fewer steps, it's easier for people to remember. Right? So, next little lesson. This is a big one. It's a little lesson, but it's a big one.
(1:00:12) Agency. If you're a small business owner, there are two core things in every business. Acquiring customers and delivering to those customers. Those are the two core elements of a business. Everything else you can outsource. Now, I'm not saying you should outsource it. I'm just saying it's possible to.
(1:00:31) But like what is the core business that you actually run? And so, if you have a business, then getting customers is a part of that. And so I think agencies have a use but not as something that you rely on. And so I would recommend learning to acquire customers which is why I make all the stuff that I do. Right? If you're like how do I acquire customers? I'll show you eight ways how to do it inside of this book. So inside the leads book I show eight different ways to get customers.
(1:00:50) Warm outreach, cold outreach, posting content, running ads, getting customer referrals, getting affiliates, other business to refer you business, getting agencies, right, to run stuff for you. But I'll show you how how we do that and the lesson I'm about to share with you. And then employees to do all those things on your behalf. Now, you as a person can only do the core four. You get other people to do these other four things on your behalf.
(1:01:08) So, how does an agency fit into this? So, an agency usually has a mastery of some sort of platform or method. So, they're either really good at like email outbound and they set appointments for you or they're really good at making content. They click click clips for you.
(1:01:18) They're really good at running paid ads on YouTube, really good at running Google ads. They're really good at SEO. They have some method of getting customers. Okay. My objective with an agency, if I have to do it, is that I want to beg, borrow, and do whatever I need to do in order to get them to teach me how they do it.
(1:01:36) And I prefer this method because agency owners tend to know how to do this better than people who teach it because they're actually doing it every day. I usually go into the intention with an agency owner to say, "Hey, here's my intention. I will sign up with you, but I will do it with the intention of learning everything I can from you so I can eventually replace you.
(1:01:56) " And so my actual story around this I tell in the agency chapter in this book, which is that I got on a phone with a bunch of agencies and they were like $3 to $5,000 a month and I could not afford that for at all. And so I knew how to run ads at the time because I'd learned from that that weekend boot camp that I did at the very beginning of my uh gym, but I needed to I need to get better, right? And so finally, it was like the third or fourth call. I was like, "Hey man, like what would it take?" That's the magic question.
(1:02:14) What would it take for you to teach me oneonone? He's like, "I don't sell my time." And I said, "Okay, what would it take? It's America. There's a price." I was like, "Well, you know, would you do it for a million dollars an hour?" And he was like, "Well, yeah." I was like, "Okay, cool. So there's a price. So you will do it. So just give me a price that you think you would do it for.
(1:02:29) " And he said, "Uh, 750 an hour." And he said that and I was like, "Deal." And so he ended up doing once a week with me for an hour. And he taught me how he would sell my ads. I was like, "This way you don't have to you don't have to include your team. You don't have any more, you know, cost to the business. Like I'll just hop. It's basically just it's just one call a week, man. 750 bucks. That's all." And so he said, "Sure.
(1:02:49) " And so for the first few weeks, the deal was I'm the only one who touches the computer. So you show me what you're doing, but I'm going to I'm going to do it right. And so I'm going to So you can tell me where I'm messing up if I get stuck. Once he taught it to me and if I didn't know how like why he was doing something I was like explain your decision-making process and then after the sixth time that I sixth call that I did I like was like I don't need this guy. I did two more calls. I didn't have anything that
(1:03:11) came up. And so for $6,000 basically the cost of one month of running this agency. I was able to learn the skill from one of the best agency owners and then I used that skill for like the rest of my advertising career. I learned how to do national ad campaigns. I learned how to do retargeting. And those are the two lessons that I really learned.
(1:03:28) I didn't know how to do and that's what I learned. And so if you're a small business owner, mastering how to get customers is one of the most important skills you can have. You can hire an agency, but you do it because you want to learn from them in my opinion. Number 20. So this is a mistake that I made. Dude, this is a crazy mistake.
(1:03:45) So this is absolute versus relative return. So I remember that I had other gyms in the area started catching on to the challenge, right? It was working really, really well. and they saw that I was doing well. So then they started running ads and these guys were more, you know, advanced business owners than me. I was 20ome, whatever.
(1:04:04) And so I remember uh this guy moved into the area and he was running ads and I asked him how much he was spending and he was like ah he's like I think we're spending like 500 a day and I was like 500 a day? Holy. And I'm spending like 50 to 100 a day. And so this guy comes in and like five to 10xes my spend.
(1:04:24) I was like oh my god he's going to take all the ad space. And the thing is is that he was willing to and I was like, "Well, what's your return?" He was like, "Ah," he's like, "I don't know. I think we're getting like four to one on it.
(1:04:36) " But that means that he's spending 15 grand and making 60, right? And here I was, you know, spending 1,500 bucks a month being really excited that I'm getting 10 to one. So I spent 1,500, make 15 grand, I net 135. This guy's spending 15, making 60, netting 45. And I was like, wait a second. So this whole time I was obsessing about like every little incremental dollar I was missing the bigger picture which is like at some point you just need to spend more money. You just need to do more.
(1:05:00) And so I was getting I was like oh no oh we went from we went from you know 13 to1 to 10 to1 I got to I got to stop. It's like no man like if I could get two to one on a million dollars and make a million dollars by spending a million to make two. I would rather do that than get 10 to one on 10 grand.
(1:05:18) And so the the big lesson that I had to learn was that I was obsessed with my rorowaz and not the absolute amount of money that I was making in profit, right? And so if the rorowaz dropped, I would stop spending money. And so the the big tld on this is just focus on the bottom line of like how much money am I going to make rather than being as obsessed with those.
(1:05:37) Now this is especially around local markets, right? You want to make you I mean fun any business you want to maximize the amount of money you're making. Obviously, having big LTV to CAC discrepancies is great, and I'm a big advocate of that, but I don't want to do that to the long-term detriment of the total amount of money that I'm making. Don't break what works. All right, so I'll tell you a very sad story.
(1:05:55) So, I had my gym and I had I kind of like tweaked my my my sessions uh a few times from when I started to like try and make them better. And I got to the point where my gym was packed. Like I I had two sessions running at any given time. I'm at a strength session and a cardio session and it was it was packed to the brim.
(1:06:13) I had 40 50 people and I only had, you know, 3,500 square ft of actual like gym space. So, it was packed. What's crazy is that because I couldn't fit any more people in, what I decided to do was I decided to cut the session times in half and consolidate it to only one type of session and combine them again.
(1:06:30) And what happened next was I churned out like a third of my customer base because they were like, "Why'd you change it? It was so great." And it was because I let the the capacity tail wag the business dog. And so basically what I should have done was say, "Oh, uh, I nailed it. I should open another location." Right? Now, if I wasn't making enough profit, then I should have fixed my price.
(1:06:48) If I have huge amount of demand, everybody's showing up and everyone loves it, then I probably had more price flexibility. But basically, what I reasoned with myself was, "Oh, I just need to find a way to fit more people so I can make more money." But it was the wrong I messed it up.
(1:07:01) Like, if you finally figure out what actually like what people love, that is the hardest thing to do. And so once they love it, if your business model is profitable, don't mess with it. Just do more. Open up more locations. If people love it and it's not profitable, then fix your pricing. Don't fix the product. Like if they love it, they love it. That's the hardest part. Pricing is easy to change.
(1:07:20) Changing what you deliver is super tough. That was one of the hardest lessons that I had to learn. And so the most elusive thing is getting customers who absolutely adore your product and service tell their friends and bring I remember what the energy of the gym was like at that point. And it was a terrible mistake for me. Ah, number 22.
(1:07:39) Work your leads. As we get as we get further in the numbers, they're just going to get sillier and sillier. No, work your leads. So, I realized that when I worked the leads, we got like three or four times more sales than if my team worked the leads.
(1:07:59) And what I realized was the incredible lever that lead nurture had on the throughput of my advertising, even larger than the throughput of closing. And so like maybe I could close 80% of people walk in the doors, but a good closer would close let's say half. And so the difference between 50% and 80% is a I don't know what the math is there. Call it a 60 or 70% difference.
(1:08:21) Okay? But the difference between getting 10% of the leads in the door and 50% of the leads in the door is a 5x difference. And so it made more sense for me to put my leverage on figuring out how to work the leads harder and better and faster than even trying to obsess about close rates. And so this is something and like this is for you.
(1:08:39) I'm like I'm going to I'm going to tell you a different story that's from the future. So I was recently talking to a business owner and he was closing 55% of his leads. leads, not shows, not calls, leads 55%. And I was like, "Dude, how you doing that?" He was like, "Oh, I pay one girl full-time. She has no other job but to call leads the moment they come in." And I want to give you an idea of of scale here.
(1:09:03) He gets about two to three leads a day. That's his business. Two to three leads a day. That's all he gets. And he pays a girl full-time. And the only job description is be available. That's it. So 247 whenever a lead comes in, you stop what you're doing. You call the lead. That's it. That's the only job she had.
(1:09:20) But and think about how crazy it is because as a business owner, you're like, well, I should give them something else. Well, think about this. Most people in his position close 10% of their leads. And we've all heard the statistic that if you call a lead within 60 seconds, you have a 391% increase in sales. Okay, 391%. Let me translate that into X's. That's a 4x. It's a 4.9x for business. Almost a 5x.
(1:09:41) If you have something that could 5x the amount of sales that you're getting from the leads that you're working right now, is there something right now that you could do that's more valuable than that? Probably not. And so the question is or the interesting thing is is that the cost of actually achieving that is the cost of one maniac that you have to pay to stop whatever they're doing to call the leads.
(1:09:59) That's it. And so think about what the difference of a 2x 3x 4x 5x in revenue would be for your business in terms of efficiency on the leads that you're currently getting. And then if that number is larger than what he would pay one maniac to call the leads, find the maniac and pay them.
(1:10:18) And so I figured out way too late that lead nurturer oftentimes is a a larger potential throughput. There's a larger discrepancy in performance on nurture than almost any part on acquisition. And so we focus at acquisition.com on that super heavily because it's one of the easiest, lowest risk levers that you can you don't even have to change any of your marketing to change anybody delivery. You just nurture better. Okay. Number 23.
(1:10:37) So, this is going to be a call back, which is never rely on another business to feed yours. Now, I made an entire video about one itis, which is that if you only have one kind of point of failure, that becomes the weak link in the chain. And so, I told you about the the gym mastermind that I joined, and everybody there was running Groupon.
(1:10:55) Well, guess what happened when Groupon stopped working? They were all out of luck, right? You have to you ideally want to have multiple ways to get customers. Now, I like to have multiple ways to get customers as I get bigger. I want to have one channel that I can reliably get customers when I'm starting out.
(1:11:13) But if it's another business that's my source, I don't like that. So, there's a difference between uh having a single channel risk versus another business risk. So, if another business can choose to shut off my my leaf flow tomorrow, very risky. And so, if I say, okay, I I do door knockocking or I do outbound, that is one channel and that can scale up usually to about a million dollars a month.
(1:11:33) And then at that point, you can kind of diversify. Now, if you're brick-andmortar or local, it's one of those businesses that's a little bit different than like the online or national space, which is that it's easier to have multiple streams. Typically, with brick and mortar, you're going to have naturally a little bit more word of mouth.
(1:11:49) It's easy to set up your Google search terms. Winning local SEO, not that hard. Running paid ads local, not that hard. All right? And so, it's more common to have multiple streams open in a local business than it is at a national level. uh just because of the nature of basically the ease of competition there.
(1:12:05) The next three lessons are going to be 24 25 26 which is uh close to when I finish the gym and so my gym my gym season and so we're going to end uh on there. So 24 25 26. All right. And so all three of these are going to be around people. And so the first thing is around what you have to pay for people. All right.
(1:12:30) So, if you can't pay to get pre great people, you're going to have to work to get great people. So, let me put it differently. It is faster to get better people by raising how much you're willing to pay. You'll just have better quality candidates that'll come towards you if you raise basically the ticket or the barrier to entry.
(1:12:46) That being said, I have had exceptional people that came for less. You just have to talk to like 10 times more people to find those people. So, it's basically like in a video game, you have to like grind or pay, right? It's like you you have to like work to level up or you can pay to level up.
(1:13:02) Well, if you're poor, you're starting out in your business, it just means that you're going to work and the work is outreach and running, you know, job postings and doing a lot of interviews and kissing a lot of toads before you find your magic prince, which hey, I'm glad that you found your magic prince, which was your customer success rep.
(1:13:18) All right? And so, you either got to grind or you got to pay. So, that's not number one. That's number 24, but number one for people. So, number 25 is a platinum roll. And this was a really eye- openening experience for me. I had an employee that taught me one of the most interesting lessons I've ever learned in managing people. So, my single best manager across all my gym locations, everyone loved him.
(1:13:35) He was an amazing trainer. He had great energy. He was in shape. He was great at sales. He was awesome. So, I ended up promoting him to manager and he did an amazing job. One of the best managers ever had. And at like month six, he came to me and he was like, "Hey, man. I don't want to be manager anymore.
(1:13:51) " And I was like, "What's going on? What's wrong? Like, let's figure this out." And he was like, "I just don't like the stress of being manager." He's like, "I'd rather just like train clients, train myself, go home." And I was like, "Well, so you still want to work here?" He was like, "Yeah, no, I love it here." I was like, "Okay.
(1:14:05) " I was like, "So, you just want to go back to your old job?" And he was like, "Yeah." So, I was like, "You're going to make half as much money." He said, "I'll just be poor then." And I remember him saying that and it was like my world like twirled around me. I was like, "I don't understand this at all." But he said it with so much conviction.
(1:14:22) I was like, I don't understand it, but I respect it. And the lesson that I took away from that was not everyone's motivated by the same things as me. And to the same degree, it means that they're motivated by other things. And I have to learn what those other things are so that I can build career paths and roles and incentives that are right for them.
(1:14:42) And so that was the whole concept of the platinum rule rather than the golden rule. Instead of like treat others the way you want to be treated, it was treat others the way they want to be treated. And that was my big takeaway that I've tried to stick with myself to this day that I still mess up all the time. But it was just like it was such a crazy lesson I fig I'd share. So 26 on people.
(1:14:58) Can you be friends with your employees? This is a a controversial one. Employees. Friends. I'll tell you the difference. So when I started, I was friends with all my employees. Whatever the professional line was, I definitely didn't have it. And so I was just friends cuz I was 20some, right? and all the people who work for me were 20 something.
(1:15:16) Like we're all just like a bunch of bunch of hooligans, right? Like trying to run a business. Basically, I didn't run that well, right? Like I would show my emotions on my sleeves. If I was upset, they would be upset. I'd take my emotions out on them. And like when I needed them to change something, it was weird because we were friends. I'm like, "Hey man, can you you know, like it just was it sucked.
(1:15:33) " So I then kind of created the rule like you can't be friends with your employees, right? And so I kind of lived that way for a while. And that maintained a professional line. And I would say that where I'm at now in my career is that you can be friends with your employees as long as you maintain a clear line which is that you they have to respect.
(1:15:50) And the easiest way that I have delineated this is literally doing a hat change. Sounds silly but it doesn't have to be an actual hat but I I'll start a conversation be like friend hat and then I'll talk whatever I'm going to talk and sometimes like hey man boss hat like this is this is what's going wrong like you need to change this right? And by being able to maintain that and I don't know if that's a maturity thing or whatever's happened. First was like friends with everyone that didn't work. Friends with no one. Uh you can do that
(1:16:14) but I would say like life is lonely. Um and then the you know the third version at least where I'm at now is that these are the people that help me accomplish my goals. I mean I can't imagine a better definition of a friend. People who like try to help you accomplish what you're what you're trying to do.
(1:16:27) And so the people that work at acquisition.com I'm friends with many of them. But we also have a line of kind of like mutual respect and professionalism because at the end of the day this is kind of you know we're business athletes and we're all on a team and so everyone needs to perform and so it's kind of having more like a coach relationship I think where it's like a coach is still I would say friends with the players but there's just some line that you don't cross and I think that that's that's really what it comes down to like I'm there for them
(1:16:50) 100%. I'm probably not going to like come in in tears because my dog dies to somebody who's on my team like I don't think that'd be appropriate, right? So it's just maintaining that line. So, these are the 26 lessons I learned from building my gyms.
(1:17:07) And if you want to see me apply these lessons to a real everyday business that's not at all in this space, check out over here where I help a stranger build a million-dollar business. And dry.

(00:00) you have this big vision for your life that you want and on this side your family gets kidnapped and if you don't do something they will kill them all which of those motivates you more right now in this video when I was 15 16 17 I was a pretty angry kid I thought that I had all these issues I would tell people I have anger issues I'm not a nice person I would tell people those things because I believe those things to be true and I saw them as problems and then I went to college and in college it's all propaganda of people who are
(00:31) teaching who've never actually done work in a real economy ever they're all tenured they don't live in reality they tell everyone they should pursue their purpose and their passion and the things that they love and I ate it up and so I read all these books on pod psychology I watched all these TED talks and the problem was I didn't make any progress and I felt like there was something even more wrong with me because I didn't feel any of that stuff I wish I could go back and tell myself dude all the stuff they're saying is just not
(01:00) true like you don't need any of that you can embrace the fact that you are angry you can embrace the fact that you feel like you are in pain and you can use that to make the life that you want you don't have to use the lovey-dovey purpose passion to build the life that you want to build what it does is it tells people that having a negative emotional experience is a bad thing but half of your life is below average by definition and so if you are not using the half of your life as energy or motivation to create the life you want then you're at
(01:30) a huge disadvantage they interviewed the top Olympic medalists and they found that they don't actually love winning they hate losing when they win they experience relief not Euphoria if you look at Steve Jobs he wasn't some happy-go-lucky dude who was like man I just want to make the world a better place he was a tough dude to work for but he created Something Beautiful from that pain MJ you look at Kobe they had imaginary situations that they created in their minds to create more suffering in their own lives to motivate and uses
(02:02) fuel imagine you have this big vision for your life that you want and on this side your family gets kidnapped and if you don't do something they will kill them all which of those motivates you more right now in this video probably the one with your family getting kidnapped it's not trying to harness a lovey-dovey feeling it's harnessing pain felt like I had experienced more pain than I had good I saw it as a disadvantage I saw it as something that I had to overcome I didn't have this big purpose I didn't have this thing that I loved I didn't
(02:33) have this thing I was passionate about and if I could have just skipped all of that and started the moment I accepted that it was okay to be angry what wasn't okay was not doing anything about it while I procrastinated by trying to find purpose jumping from thing to thing to thing trying to find the thing that really lit my fire and just accepted that it was totally okay to work my face off in disgust from my current circumstance and who I was then I would have gotten to where I wanted to go much faster so many
(03:05) people are believing a lie they have to be happy they have to have purpose passion for what they're doing in order to get out of their situation they think that they are poor because they don't have passion that is false you were poor because you're not doing the activities that makes you rich and you can fuel those activities whatever way you damn well please and so if you are somebody who is more motivated by the dark side then Lean Into the Dark Side unlike the saying the road to hell is paved with good intentions the equal opposite of
(03:34) that is the road to Heaven is paved with bad intentions you can do good [ __ ] with bad motivation and when I say bad I mean negative experiences pain anger Etc I still have tons of motivation from that side you can use that negative fuel hit it on speed dial every time you're confronted with that thing that you don't want to do you push through it and what happens you do that enough times you start to get good at the thing you start seeing the result of work that has compounded and start to see a purpose or
(04:00) start to see a bigger Vision the big vision for Alex's life until maybe four years ago was don't be broke what was your mission with Jim my mission was to stop being poor there are elements of [ __ ] that I do that I absolutely love but there is tons of [ __ ] that I do every day that I [ __ ] hate I just don't hate it more than I hate the alternative and the richest people in the world they all say it's not about the money because if it's about the money you stop the moment you have enough the people with the wealthiest in
(04:25) the world have the three things in common they have the big goal they have massive fears about never being enough and then they have impulse control to stay on goal and oftentimes that impulse control comes from right as you approach the guard rail looking over the edge and imagining what it would be like to have your friends tell you that you were a failure have them laugh behind your back or talk down about you or have your parents when they're introducing you as their fun-loving kid you know he's still figuring himself out that is what would
(04:51) crush me the boring [ __ ] that you have to do is not fun Jeff basis talks about overhead in business there's tons of things that you have to do and be willing to do that you do not enjoy the question is whether you do not enjoy them more then you do not enjoy the pain that you are going away from as long as the pain of moving forward is less than the pain of going back and the pain that you imagine from not taking the action that you know should be taking then you can use that energy as the single fuel that you can stay on path for an
(05:18) extended period of time I'm writing my book right now I'm on the 11th [ __ ] draft like there is no feeling that makes me more sick than the idea that I could have done more the pain of the idea of that book not doing well or that book leading to people being like I don't think he tried as hard that is the thing that hurts so much more than going from the top yet again to make another video to make an another article to make another short to make another [ __ ] chapter revision yet again so that when I do launch it I think to myself I
(05:49) literally exhausted every option on this one of the sayings that I live by is that I will not do my best I will do what is required and the difference between what your best is and what is required is the difference between what you think your real best is and what your actual best is and what your actual best is is the thing that you would do to prevent everyone you know from dying what people care about is the outcome what you put out in the world now why you do it what fuels you that's your business and so if you are in one of
(06:16) these situations and you can't find that purpose you can't find that passion cool but it doesn't give you permission to not be successful

Transcript:
(00:00) the most powerful things that change our behavior and our character are the stories we tell ourselves i think that when i started out in business uh i've heard i heard all these things in the personal development space like uh you should have you should read these affirmations every morning blah blah blah i never did that and it was because it felt stupid to me now that being said there might be some people who've had life-changing results from doing that but what i did notice is that the stories i would tell myself about myself
(00:28) were the things that changed my beliefs they were the things that changed my character and so a lot of times in some of my other videos i've talked about how entrepreneurship is about three things it's about changing the beliefs that you have it's about increasing the skill set that you have and then the character traits that go along with that to make sure the skills are successful so i'll give you a simple example for this so a friend of mine he started a fitness app um he was doing about twenty thousand a month he
(00:50) was a top game uh crossfit games competitor um but he was really ashamed because he wasn't the winner he was like you know really really highly ranked one but he wasn't the winner and so he believed that his app wasn't good enough and so he never promoted it so it grew to 20 000 a month in revenue with him doing zero promotion right and when he realized that it was okay for him to promote it and people got a lot of value from it in the app was good enough he went from 20 000 a month to like 150 000 a month like that
(01:18) and the difference was his beliefs his skills were the same right his character traits are the same he changed his beliefs right so let me give you a different example so when i actually started out getting in my own business right i uh i had a chain of gyms this was a very very you know this was ten years ago i had changed gyms i knew how to run sales teams i knew how to generate leads i need to do all these things um but what ended up happening was i had one missing piece which was also a belief darn i was actually trying
(01:46) to give you a different one but i had a mentor come in and say you need to be you need to get in the licensing business you need to license this model to lots of people rather than doing the actual model yourself and so um i did make that transition and then we went from i think you know i think we did like two or three million dollars to doing seven and the next year we did 28 million so the year that we made the transition halfway through is what jumped us from two or three to seven and it was just in the last like four months
(02:06) that we saw this crazy growth and then we did 28 million the next year and so it was because i had all these skills and i also had the character traits i just needed again to change my beliefs i was trying to give you an example with the character traits let me think of one so if you have uh for example if i had had those skills but i didn't have the character traits of being disciplined and being focused on one thing i would have jumped uh between multiple you know entrepreneurial endeavors and never been able to see success because even though
(02:29) i had the beliefs about what was possible um like if i'd said okay i'm gonna do gyms and i'm gonna do chiropractors and i'm gonna do dentists i'm gonna do x y and z right until i had the character trait of focus the character trait of discipline um then i would not have seen the success right and so the next natural question is okay well if i have to have aligned beliefs skills and character traits at each level of the ladder because you can have and this is what's crazy when you see the overnight successes this is what
(02:55) happens i want to describe it to you so you understand it and how you can do it so let's say that there's a ladder all right and you've got this pole on one side you've got the pole on the other side and you've got the middle bar okay you need all three to move to the next level of the ladder right and so for example you might have the left side built up six stories above where you're at and you might have uh the right side build up six stories you know uh are you know ten stories from where you're at right now but all of a sudden if you change
(03:20) your character and that character trait development gives you three more rungs all of a sudden you go three rungs because you already have the constraint has been removed and so you can be more advanced in your beliefs than you on your skills or it can be more advanced in your character trait than you are in your skills or you can be more advanced in your skills than your own your beliefs right and so it's having all three of those that are checked off at each level of entrepreneurship that gets you to one one million dollars a year
(03:43) three million or ten million dollars or a hundred million dollars or whatever it is right is you have to have all of them and so what i the point of this video and i'm gonna is is to get you to understand how to actually develop those soft things because the skills are straightforward right the skills are you just go by the course and you read the book and you consume the content like this and you practice you apply right that's what you have to do that's it that's it right um one of the skills that i see lots of marketers these days
(04:07) not have is they don't know how to sell they don't know how to develop a sales team they don't know how to manage and grow a sales team they don't want to lead a sales team that's a skill they don't have and as soon as they do they go from 3 million to 10 million like that very very easily right it's understanding that that's the skill deficit and as soon as they do it boom they blow up i was fortunate because i had a ton of the skills in my skill toolbox but i went from making nothing to tons because i had all of these rungs
(04:29) of this ladder already built out to a 30 million dollar level except i just didn't have the beliefs that was my issue candidly i suffer from a lot of insecurities and so my wife was the one who was like you can do this like you don't have to have these gyms like you can license out the model like you can you can really succeed like this and i honestly just thought she was a really smart person and very wise and so i trusted her belief in me before i really trusted it for myself and so hopefully you can have something
(04:56) like that in your life but maybe that that could be me i trust in your i trust in your your skills and your beliefs so so hopefully you can borrow some of that trust because i promise you the world does get better when you when you take those leaps of faith but the point is is if you have these three things right the stories that you tell yourself right one of the things that layla always says is my wife she has her own channel you can check it out um is she's like what's the evidence right what's the evidence
(05:19) that you're so bad at this what's the evidence that you have cause you keep beating yourself up about this but what's your evidence right and so what i do when i identify a character trait that i lack or identify a skill that i don't have or a belief that i don't have and this one i'll just specifically talk about the character traits because i think it's really important it's probably the one that people struggle with the most what are the stories that you tell yourself about yourself right a lot of times i had dinner recently with
(05:42) a 5 million year entrepreneur and he was like i had a lot of trauma when i was a kid and that's why i am this way he speaks like he is this way because and i was like i think that's a really convenient story to tell yourself about why you are anxious or why you exhibit anxious tendencies i was like but what if you did that and you just didn't exhibit anxious tendencies what then what if you just chose not to what if you chose to not give power to that situation or that parent uh when you were growing up why why they
(06:14) already made you suffer why would you let them make you suffer more by telling yourself that they gave you this character trait then it's because it's uncomfortable for you to suffer through the change of changing your identity right but layla and i both believe this is that your identity is fluid and you need to be able to change your identity and your character traits based on what the business requires if you want to grow right like if you're not a patient person then you need to become patient macro micro speed macro patients right if you
(06:39) want to develop a reputation you need to become a person of integrity which means sometimes short term you have to sacrifice right you have to not make the quick buck if you want to be disciplined and have focus and it means that you have to be able to say no strategy means what do you say no to that still looks like it makes sense on paper that's strategy that's what it is it's what things do we choose not to invest in right and the people who learn how to make the most money are the ones who know how to focus and that's a
(07:01) character trait and so what you have to do is you have to appeal in your past and say when did i exhibit these things because all of us have exhibited these character traits at some point in our life and then what you do is you say i am this way because and then you tell yourself the stories of the things you did in the past that exhibited those traits and by doing that you'll start reminding yourself so if i want to say like because i'll tell you i used to have more angry tendencies i used to tend and trend towards being angry as a response
(07:29) to things that i didn't like right but one of the things that i liked like that i try and tell myself is that i am wise right and this is a character trait that's probably been the number one character trait that i've tried to develop over the however many years just because i believe discernment is the single greatest character trait you can have because if you make the right decisions the whole world is your oyster right if you can make the right call the whole world is your oyster and so for me wisdom is the number one
(07:52) character trait that i wish to develop and so when i think to myself i am wise because i use the same formula that you that most people and most of us myself included use to destroy ourselves with these insecurities with these with these negative character traits that we believe we have and instead of saying an affirmation you tell yourself the story of why what you're saying is true you learn to argue against your own thoughts and that's how you start developing this muscle this these traits that start to become a
(08:24) whisper and then a shout and then they become they emanate from you and you project them when you walk in the room subconsciously but it's a practice that goes from active to passive in your mind right if you are a patient person if you are a kind person if you are an integris person right if you're a hard-working person right we all have these stories that we tell about ourselves and so if you have a limitation right now on your character trait or traits you don't feel like you are patient enough you feel like you are too
(08:52) easily distracted you feel like you don't focus enough then you need to start telling yourself the story i am this way because not i am wealthy stupid in my opinion i think our brains are too smart for that stuff you have to give it the reasons you have to make the argument and i think instead of affirmations if you make affirmations into arguments that you make with yourself every day then those become things that will change who you are and if you change who you are and how you make decisions you'll change
(09:19) your entire life and you'll be able to watch your business grow as a result of who you have become and so this is one of the things that was most powerful for me in my entrepreneurial journey i had had tons of insecurities right i had tons of anxieties i had lots of anger i had lots of perceived trauma and i'll say it that way because i don't even want to make it into trauma that's what i perceived as trauma because i was a child in the world with the the regular the emotional regulation of a child and so things of course affect you more when
(09:48) your kid everyone's traumatized traumatized perceives trauma as a child like if i go to a stage and i say hey who here had a traumatic childhood in some instance or had a traumatic event occur everyone's going to raise their hand so stop thinking that because you have trauma and i don't say this i'll say this with it i'll say it this way better for me i chose to stop giving trauma power and i think if you can do that and you can tell yourself a different story about why you are who you are and make arguments instead of
(10:19) affirmations you'll be able to have stronger faster change in the direction that you desire and you'll have more control over your emotional state and then in so doing you'll be able to level up the business that you have because most of times when i see business owners the reason they're not successful is not because they don't have the beliefs or because they don't have the skills it's just because of who they are i'd call the other day and somebody hopped on and they were like ah and honestly the guy was an
(10:43) he was like man employees suck and i can never keep any good talent blah blah blah blah and i just paused and i was like that's not surprising and he was like what i was like have you met you like i don't know what else to say have you met you like i don't need to change this guy's marketing right i don't need to change this guy's beliefs about his own business he's just to change who he is right and the only way for that guy to do that is for him to get over the reasons that he tells himself it's okay to be who he
(11:14) is and i think a lot of us do that we give ourselves the excuse for being impatient we give ourselves the excuse for cheating right we give ourselves the excuse for being unfaithful you get the excuse for being unloyal well my dad was where my mom was or my brother was or whatever right or when i was growing up or went from my town i xyz i'm this way because the cows is one of the most powerful words in the english language it's great for persuasion make sure you use it to persuade yourself in the right direction so anyways that's
(11:41) just my two cents i might not know anything um if you found value in this hit subscribe i have other videos that like this for entrepreneurs who are trying to uh scale their businesses uh keeping awesome keep being amazing lots of love mosey national guys see you guys in the next video bye

Transcript:
(00:00) I want to talk about the secrets of scaling paid ads no matter what business level you're at biggest obstacle is just throw ads going down you spend more money 10 million ads very low trust and that's it so I said a bunch of businesses at different sizes ask me questions about their paid ads and I'm going to do my very best to answer them so from you know $10 million a year all the way down to $600,000 a year in terms of size some people are trying to start running paid ads some people are trying to expand or scale their ads and are running into particular issues 650 Dental recruiting
(00:33) how do I start marketing so you currently run ads for job boards where you at raise your hand there you go so you run ads on job board so you already know how to run ads all right this is me trying to break a belief for you so you're already do it you're just doing it on another platform all right so you're doing it in order to get dentists but you're also trying to attract dentists who have clinics I don't think it's you just happen to be on job boards but fundamentally um you can run the I mean dentists are also on meta same thing uh they're probably older more boring I said that with love
(01:06) to dentists uh so I would look yeah Instagram Facebook will probably do really really well for you and just saying hey I have a like tired of taking all these calls yourself like talk to the pain point of that dentist so it's like they don't want to work weekends they don't want to work early hours they don't want to take cases they don't want to take well or they don't want to um they want to eventually retire someday but they don't want to let down all their patients and they don't want to sell us in private Equity because they're going to force them to work for
(01:31) 5 years in servitude and control their lives so these are the pain points right um bless cousins a dentist that's fresh on my mind uh and so these are all the pains that's my hook for the ads and then targeting take your customer list make it look like audience off that list if dentist is in the copy dentist is in the video the AI on Facebook will also notice Ser it to dentist and it'll be pretty straightforward Bingo all right uh 600k acupuncture start okay so if you want to run so this is local right okay so the nice thing is that local business businesses are the
(02:00) easiest business to run ads for okay because trust is Skyhigh and you're like oh they're they don't trust me like try and sell Beauty to you know people on the Internet it's much harder um so all you need to do is run Legion ads so I'm going to give you the simplest strategy for getting this are you guys technically proficient you are okay fantastic I was going to assume you weren't and give you an even easier way um but all you want to do is you can just run lead ads okay for some sort of free thing and you're like I want really high quality people well welcome to cold traffic so uh they won't be but what you
(02:33) will need to create is a sales process that creates qualified customers all right and so when I say creates it's really just filters for good ones just think about it like that it's just like I'm adding filters uh and the more filters you add the more expensive the leads will be if they're good filters and if they're more expensive they'll be good if they're good filters if you add bad filters they'll be more expensive but they won't be better so if I make it really hard for my page to load it adds
(02:55) friction but it's not good friction if I add a vsl so video sales letter to a page it'll create friction but it'll be good friction so I'll increase the quality of the lead by doing that and so with a local business you're going to want to have like in larger National companies this is where brand adding the building trust adding Value First matters in local it matters significantly less it is very offer driven on a local basis because people know what acupuncture is so you can say free thing or $19 thing since you
(03:24) probably your time costs a little bit more than maybe a low skilled labor uh job I'd probably go for the to $999 thing maybe somewhere in there if I had to Bet 19 to 29 would be where I'd start and what you do is you sell people on that they opt in for it thank you page they can purchase it you still call all the leads yourself you close them on the $19 thing to get a card on file when you schedule you'll confirm that appointment and that that card's attached to that person and so then you'll do the treatment that you're going to do and
(03:57) then you're going to sell them the plan afterwards okay now now my preference here would be that you sell before you treat if that doesn't work out for you you can treat first I just prefer to have someone in pain sell them the much longer thing that's going to permanently solve it give them short-term relief afterwards and set their next visit and then on the like when you do your actual sales appointment the nice thing is you already have the card and so you can say awesome so this is this do you want to use the card you have on file great and that's the sale does that make sense
(04:27) okay that's the acupuncture process all right 3 million CrossFit coach business coach uh brand conscious so you guys are doing what kind of cont you guys making oh podcast is the the only thing okay so you guys are doing podcasts and that's it we some longer cont okay got it okay um the business started from the podcast the podcast was first yeah understood uni personalities yeah are you guys um barbell uh Shrugged he was that was yours okay got it yeah yeah okay okay I hear you um I never had a name to a face but I knew the podcast okay so where would I start okay first thing I would do same thing earlier is I
(05:11) would do a retargeting campaign across all platforms and the nice thing is that platforms are not super hard to figure out they're made zillions of dollars to make them easy to click if you already have traffic so you install a pixel for each of the platforms on your page you'll start collecting data from every single visit that's already coming from your podcast you can start retargeting so that's layer one you should probably also earn your PPC terms it'll immediately make money like there's no PPC campaign for your own terms that doesn't make money I haven't seen it ever happen my entire life um so that's
(05:38) number one and two so own your own terms do the retargeting um third thing is you have to come up with something that's really Banger and like super super valuable that you can give away for free um like you've seen my stuff so the the money models books the um the the framework the 11 Frameworks for profitable gyms all that stuff so really put time into it because I think people really skimp on this and that's why people opt in they see it they're like oh this is [ __ ] why would I continue to book with this person right and so they opt in thank you page schedule it still
(06:08) works now the thing is is that you guys do have a brand if you're worried about being brand conscious all you do is just be true to you in the ads and my recommendation is let your clients talk so just let proof do the talking that's how I would approach it um when I look at all the ads that we've done over the years like I said earlier 80% of them are about proof and so as much as we want to think it's all about us like no one cares like Alex had the big gym I still do right the big gym company one
(06:37) I'm not in the ads anymore at all and I wasn't for the last two years and it was because we just focused on the customers because gym owners don't really care about me I mean they care about making money and they're like I'm glad he helped but really they just want to make more and see other people like them that they can say oh this is a good approximation of my gym and so the idea there is you want to create the most compelling proof as possible which is the type of proof would that would be the least likely to be faked so on this extreme you'd have a faceless Anonymous 10-year outdated text based
(07:07) testimonial on this extreme I would have someone walk up on stage who looks just like you owns a CrossFit uh business coaching business and says Alex help me go from 3 million to 30 million you'd be like [ __ ] and I'd be like cool so you'd be like that's a really good approximation really hard to Juke right here live in front of me not recorded in person specific to me and so that's kind of the Continuum when you're showing proof and every approx every every takeaway it's like okay iners is better than um than virtual uh live is better
(07:37) than recorded uh like me is better than doesn't look like me uh the result that I want is better than a result that's close to what I want and so you just look at all of the factors that make something super compelling and when you're looking at your proof kind of think through it that checklist and that'll make more compelling proofs that make more compelling ads that you only lose trust in the marketplace when you say something that isn't true and if you're not saying it and it's their fact of life how can anyone fault you yep 800k vacation rentals B2B so
(08:07) you're trying to get people who have uh properties to list with you so that you can make more money with their properties for them okay so this will be really really easy to advertise because your fundament so do you want people who already okay you don't want the extra room people you want the people who have properties that are being mismanaged we target homeowners who have a secondary home that they only use a couple weeks okay and don't do anything in the meantime exactly okay so um I would start with so my so one I would probably still use meta as my first bet just because
(08:45) the targeting there is going to be easier to figure out um the ads themselves are going to be the same thing lead with pain like I was saying with the dentist is what is the pain of that person which is do you feel like you're wasting money money by having your house sit empty every year as or every month as you keep paying your mortgage on something that doesn't get you a return right it'd be something to that degree you would know the pain better than me but that's what I would imagine the pain would look like um and
(09:16) so what I would then do is I would send probably five case studies of different representative houses and different representative avatars so kind of the point I was making there with the CrossFit gym owners is that in the thing that I want to send is like we're going to give you an estimate in the meantime I'm going to show you 10 representative types of homes that you can probably find one that's close to yours so you can have some reasonable expectation of what you could potentially earn switching to shortterm in the meantime and at the bottom I have the commonly
(09:43) asked questions which is are these people going to trash my place what are you know what's my security going to look like uh how what if they don't leave uh cleaning blah blah blah like all the questions that are going to be there and I answered that in the bottom there because we already solved this we do this with this many homes proof um and so we've been doing this for this long more proove and so if you'd like we can give you an estimation of what we think based on your neighborhood your zip code and we can personalize our process to you great okay that's the ad
(10:08) uh and the case study that you give them so free download thank you page scheduler very simple if you want you can add an application if you get too many app if you get too many opt-ins that aren't qualified you can add more friction so just for everyone it's like what's the perfect funnel if you get too many that are bad add friction if you don't get enough remove friction and if you have almost no friction and there's still bad leads the targeting is off okay uh 2 million Beauty 4.6 Riz meta okay you guys are in Columbia you're shutting down the other two countries
(10:35) that aren't working as well you're set you're 30 the 30% you're at 4.6 why aren't you scaling is the question so the question like what is the actual question here we really want to scale like five the next the revenue okay and we want to increase our o okay so how would you like uh plan the strategy to do that we're currently making like 100% only in meta ads great maybe Test new creatives new platforms but how would you the strategy the team to do that the content creation MH because that's like a new
(11:10) level that we're not yeah so two ways that you can scale the row at so one is spend more obviously so I'm not even including that but in terms of improving your row as itself it means you either have to drive down CAC or increase uh LTV right or average average car value so in terms of driving now CAC what I would do is I would look at the top you probably run a th000 ads over the last year look at the top 10% or 5% of ads look at the first 3 seconds of each of those ads and see if you can model those three seconds with all of the remaining
(11:42) ads that you have you can even slice that first three seconds off of the best winners and past it on to another 100 plus ads so that'll get you 10 50 times more ad creative per good winner that you get so you can squeeze more out of it so that's from the creative strategy to drive down ad cost from the uh LTV perspective um are you guys selling are you guys selling subscriptions or you just selling we sell like devices and also Cosmetics so we have an IPL remal device we have led mask we have led like
(12:13) devices uh we also you sell bundles compl there are Cosmetics to those devices okay and you sell so you sell the devices and then the recurring goal is that people buy the uh order devices because those are almost like a one time purchase only yeah that's what I'm saying so they one time purchase on the devices but the uh gels or lotions and Potions go to on a recurring basis right I mean that's not our main focus because they like low ticket yeah I got you the nice thing is that when it's low ticket when someone buys a high ticket the
(12:45) likel they buy the low ticket thing if you bundle it up is pretty high so if someone buys $1,000 I know what's the cost like $80 that a high ticket for that's fine okay so if you have an $80 thing then you could still sell a $40 annual for 12 packs of the creams or whatever that go with it you just need to sell a whole bundle of that because think about it from the consumer if I'm buying it's because I believe that I'm going to do this and if I am going to do it then I might as well get the savings on the stuff that goes with it like if I
(13:15) buy a printer and someone says Hey buy a Year's worth of Inc and you in the m in the moment you're like well I am going to print stuff that's why I'm buying it then and not everyone's going to take it but if 30% of people take it you add 12 bucks to your to your uh ACV and right there you've got whatever that is 15% um that you add so that's one thing um in ter do you have payment plans and financing set up uh yeah okay so that's good um the big thing with I mean I would still I would lean harder on that thing that I'm talking about with the the CP like think about the other think about the other things that someone who
(13:46) purchases this uh machine is going to want to buy and still offer it like there's no point and then just think about doing it in bundles rather than one-offs because one-offs aren't going to make a difference but bundling for the the year will'll multiply this with any of those small knickknacks buy a lot so you might even be able to double for like the max cart might be able to you know double how much someone spends um and you'll feel those pops so I think between those two things but I think as a quick word of advice um you guys are in the beauty director consumer business
(14:15) you are a marketing company and so doubling down on Creative as a discipline is what's going to separate you from like if you want to get to 20 million a year it's going to be you doing 10 times or 50 times more cre cretive in terms of what you're putting out for output and so that means being having a better system for both capturing ugc and then repurposing ugc and so for us for context we spend 80% of our resources taking winners and just reskinning them 80% and so you're getting all these new ads but the the real money is okay I have this one winner and um I had I'll give you a
(14:52) story I had an ad that we called the kale ad so kale is our our GM right and he made this ad before he was the GM and it was this beautiful this perfect testimonial and he couldn't have planned it any better he had like the gym behind him he had his wife with him he was like we were two months from shutting our doors you can see the gym full he's like and within four months it was completely full 18 months I had it you know six months I had it completely outsourced by 18 months I sold the whole gym and I was
(15:17) losing money and I was working a full-time job just to pay the bills at the gym and you know this many months later it was all great right now when we had that ad I made about a hundred versions of that ad so I made a black and white version I did a sepia filter version I reordered the back end um we swapped out hooks I put different headlines I put different subheads I changed the fonts I did I ran it with different ad copy I will use and abuse it until it doesn't work at all and so when you have your winners you usually just need to run them way longer way
(15:49) harder in a lot of different variations so you can squeeze way more out of it feel good cool all right uh 1.8 Private Practice okay so the question what was the question on this you want to scale it oh the the lead ma okay yes so right now you've ran your ads to application so opt-in application and that didn't work and then you go freebies to book a call and that's not working because your call team sucks we running freebie to get people inside Facebook group okay and then having a trying to set the calls from the group okay we're have a lot of
(16:30) capacity for the to set more calls to more sales so we wanted to do something that was more directly to book callip the process sure time so it works it's just expensive um okay so I'll give you what I know from group funnels that run on school all the time and so there's four conversion processes from a group so one is that you add a free onboarding call to the free group so every single person that gets added to the group gets an odd Morning Call as a bonus for joining the group on the odd morning call you then clarify where they there label no problem over their past experiences oh I think you might be a good fit can I tell
(17:07) you about it Grant okay cool then you sell them into the into the other thing um the second way is that you put uh five video series inside of the group that functions as a vssl but just broken up and so you introduce the opportunity your core Story the big idea and then you do three stories which are going to be their biggest belief breaking points so big issue one big issue two big issue three which is typically Universe other people in self and break down all three of those and then on the end you'll make
(17:31) your call to action which is the fifth video which is a little bit of Stack a little bit of Sizzle and you make the CTA the third one is that inside of that group you'll do a weekly webinar where you provide value for the majority of the webinar and you soft toss the CTA your sales guys and sets are on that webinar anybody who chats in there they can pull off if somebody's like oh man I got this question oh that was so valuable they immediately DM them and pull them off the call and then they can set them right there the fourth way is that anybody who engages on recordings
(17:57) or posts inside the group grou likes comments or makes a post the DM Setters go in and then set the call so it's four different ways that you can set from the group and if you're driving all your traffic there and it is working you just probably need to train your Setters better and maybe have more of them yep all right uh 1.
(18:17) 2 million VA so you want to start running ads for your VA business to get business owners yes sir okay what type of va so it's a virtual assistant either primary secondary United States we can do estimates credit cards calls for service based companies estim so like Home Services okay so you're looking for service business owners like ruing right to hire vas to do some of the leg work for their team okay so the good news is that Home Services is pretty easy to Target um with ads I would probably also start on meta there um just cuz meta
(18:59) targeting really is probably the easiest Tik Tok is pretty good targeting too it's getting much much much better but I would start with meta so Facebook and Instagram um and again the the funnels here are just really valuable thing for how many how many clients do you have okay you have 70 clients and so what I would want to do is show how much money they save and how much more profit they make per roofer and I would just literally explain it a lot of people won't know so be like the average roofer or the
(19:27) average home service person who has Tradesmen who are going out are spending this much per hour to have the person do that do estimates do card checks do whatever the three main things that you do and that means that per person it's costing you $25,000 a year in labor all right now the thing is is that for $500 a month we can replace this so take 25,000 and instead pay six per year so you get the spread you get $199,000 back per person and so if You' like to see how we can help you implement this we will guarantee this result um and by day
(19:57) 90 if you haven't made at least five times the money that we've done we'll give you the rest of the year of the vas for free that would be my offer the actual creative would be you breaking down the process and what you want to do is have some sort of visual proof that's like this is what JN did and JN made this much you know saved this much money here's Stu and Stu saved this much and just say the size of the business so he's doing about $10 million a year he's got 20 guys and this is what he was able to save so if these numbers sound at least interesting to you we'd be happy
(20:25) to hop on a call if you have a two call close you can say you can leave your credit card home it's just to make sure it's a fit for us as much as it fit for you we only take roofers above a certain size so if you are smaller don't worry we'll send you with some resources that can help you out for free but if you are above a size we might be able to help you out and either way it would be another call for us to close so you can relax it's not a sales call cool so add with that kind of copy and messaging and
(20:49) then freebie thing that will also be a longer version of that with maybe some writing that gives some graphs and some visuals or whatever and then you can have the thank you page scheduler uh for them to book a call still outbound dial all the people you have some vas I'm sure they can do that call all the leads that opt in no matter what and the nice thing with that is that if your vas are good then they can be like I'm a VA I could be doing this for you that would be my script okay yep do you have an email list yeah so if you have an email list
(21:22) of over a thousand I'm assume you do um you can take that list and then put a look like audience and start there as you're targeting cuz that be the issue for you in the beginning yep and make that the headline like home service providers okay uh 1.2 million in solar what now 7 plus row as things are working I'm going to tell you where are you I'm going to tell you to spend more all right so what's the problem expanding like do I continue creating and tting ads or 8020 % the budget testing 80% yeah so Google already really experimented with this so the the technical one is the better one is 70210
(22:08) so 70% is doing the main thing so just the one ad that you have 20% is adjacent to that so as many different ways as you can think of you know versions of it that's not that at so everything that I see as permutations of that I see as the 70 adjacent to that similar in style is the 20 10 is just wild ass ideas of maybe this would would work and so that's how you allocate resources and I'm being super real so if you spend a whole day making ads so you spend eight hours that means you're going to do 1
(22:36) hour 45 minutes on your one idea and then you're going to spend two plus hours on adjacent ideas and then the entire rest of the day is on how many different ways can I make the same ad per and that's how you allocate time it's the same way we allocate time when we make ads we look up all the top winners we start with all those we hammer out all that stuff because that's our real work that's the bread and butter then we move one that way I said it in reverse in terms of order for the day but fundamentally I want to get the 70 done first the 20 done second and if
(23:05) I've got time and I'm feeling energy I'll do the third all right so $1.2 million in Assisted Living Facebook and YouTube they're getting 20 to1 row as the thing that you guys should do is spend more money because you have eight spots left in your assisted living and you're getting 20 to1 and you should be okay with doing that as long as you have capacity if you know what your rate of filling people up is then you can dial the spend so that you can keep it so it's smooth now if you're losing money every month that those things aren't full then I would crank it and then turn it off if you
(23:36) want the weight list thing I would know that I only need three people or four people on the weit list that they have to pay in order to be on the weit list otherwise it's not a weit list it's just like telling someone to go away and then assuming they're going to you know care about you when they when you call back even though they've already solved the problem uh because they're probably in a market and want to you move within a certain number of months CU someone's in pain when I say pain it's a pain in the ass to deal with somebody who's you know
(24:00) you're trying to put into that and so that is what I would do if I were in your particular situation and I would go get investors so you can open up more locations faster check all right ding ding ding all right so $10 million Executive Health the running YouTube ads are getting 10 to one these guys are spending $1,000 a month to make $10,000 back even though they're doing a million-ish a month on their main business so that means 1% of their revenue comes from their YouTube ads and the question is how do we scale the main problem is compliance and so they're in a health space and so
(24:32) a lot of the issues in health sometimes wealth even relationship stuff is the claims that you make and being able to support them and so number one is there are firms that specialize in compliance Audits and so I go like if we have an issue like one of our it happens all the time right ads get shut down because there's all these different automated things even if you're doing nothing wrong so you go to these firms and usually just ask them what their approval rating is uh post compliance usually it's 90% Plus for the good ones it doesn't cost that much it's like five or six grand and they'll go through the
(25:01) audit all the sites the audit all the the videos and collateral that you use so that then you can resubmit and they usually have some sort of in internal Google kind of back door where they say hey we will make sure these people are compliant they relationship with Google and uh they can make sure that you get pushed through so usually un as long as you're not doing anything completely racy which I'm guessing you're not um you should be fine great $10 million Roofing PPC so you want to expand so you're spending $30,000 a month which row as 71 okay 71 row as $10 million a
(25:32) month Roofing doing PPC wants to expand and you're in a local market okay so if you're trying to expand there first campaign I would run would be a retargeting across all platforms so I would be retargeting on gdn so Google Display Network I'd be retargeting on Instagram i' retar on Facebook um I'd be retargeting on YouTube anyone who's done a site visit that'll be the first and easiest Riz that you can get because you've already paid for it so consider that like the shadow funnel which is whenever you blow traffic through anything you should always have Global
(26:03) retargeting across all platforms because then you can scoop up everything else and it almost always is positive roas so number one um number two if I had to pick another um platform I would actually do meta um because obviously PPC have super high intent so the lead quality is going be lower on meta because it's Interruption based marketing rather than tent based marketing um because people aren't looking for it when they're scrolling on Facebook but a lot of older people are on meta so Facebook especially but Instagram too Instagram's got the whole the whole gamut right and so people who
(26:35) have roofs uh to fix and so I actually think it'll be fine that Facebook's aging up a little bit for you to run ads there and since the average ticket's so high in Roofing um you'll probably good in terms of the funnel um typically like free audits or some sort of free thing is good enough um and you can talk to them about savings that they're going to make if they fix the roof uh in terms of heating cooling all the other Jazz that you guys do um and you can basically do that for free you can send someone out you can do it virtually and then probably two call close so set close
(27:05) after the freebie freebie is the first page call thing is the second page call all people who opt in for the freebie to confirm the call that they did and if they didn't book set the call and then close on the call that's actually booked so if they book for Wednesday call them anyway today confirm qualify if you don't have time to set it well you will have time cuz you're setting it set it and then close on the appointment on Wednesday so it can speed up the sales cycle great real estate long-term rentals investment interesting stuff
(27:42) um so rowes is down trust is down unsurprising um and so the question that you have is how do you increase Ro and build trust for this client so um there's two ways that I can think of so one is making content long term is what adds is what grows the organic audience it's what allows a lot of people here to even have the business they have and you'd be surprised it is slower but over time it does compound and it becomes a pretty big stream and if you know how to run ads and you can make content that's what makes you a weapon because it's
(28:14) like it's crazy when you can do both second thing um focus more on proof not on promise everyone makes promises very people have proof so proof so if you think about this this is a little little sound bite for you your promise is not unique your proof is everyone in the marketplace promises the same thing the question is whether they can back it up and that is unique to you and so if you want to have a more unique place in the mark in the market have more proof not a different promise fundamentally like all gym owners want to make more money most business owners want to make more money or they want to
(28:46) save time or they want to save headache or whatever it is like the promises aren't going to be that different the thing that will differentiate you will be the mechanism how believable it is which will be a function of the proof and the the way that you're describing it if you're like oh we have this brand new personal training model where you do six personal training sessions up front and then you get them into this and look at the economics behind it people stay way longer it's like oh that's a unique mechanism and it's like okay that sounds like it's different than what I did but how do I know it works cool here's a
(29:10) hundred stories of people who were in your exact position that made it work right so proof is going to be the main thing now the other way that you can build trust um beyond the proof is you I think group funnels right now work really really well I I think that they're going to I mean the reason I invest in school because I think that um but group funnels are like routinely getting people from like $250 calls to like $40 calls and I'm seeing this like over and over again across Industries and so the way that these funnels work I already talked about the conversion
(29:39) mechanisms earlier but you use the free group as a lead magnet so that becomes the lead magnet and the nice thing is that it it functions basically like an email list with long-term nurture but it's way more engaging than an email list is um and so people who use the group funnels uh right now just to give you a metric to this also for you for the groups it's 10% so the guys who do do a good job convert 10% of people who opt in uh to the group into their their next level thing and so most people are
(30:06) able to close 30 to 50% of calls they get on and so you can Target getting on call with onethird of the people who opt in for the group and closing between 30 and 50% so if you get on call with 30% and you close a third you get 10% of the group depending obviously there's some Flex on skill there um but that's kind of just some benchmarks that you can that you can look at but those the three things so add more proof make more content consider a group funnel boom all [Applause] right thank

I Discovered The Easiest Million Dollar Business to Start in 2024 - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rm4zRdLAyjw

Transcript:
(00:00) the easiest business to start to make a million dollar a year is also the hardest business to get to $100 million a year and I say this to someone who is both a product of the education space which is by the way wink wink the business model I'm going to talk about but I've also done 100 million plus in sales in that business and sold my last one for 46.
(00:20) 2 million and so I have a very good understanding of being both a customer in that industry and a supplier of that industry and so I want to make this video for two types of people first is somebody who's like hey I want to start a business and the second is for people who have a business and they're considering switching into an education or coaching business and this business and this video is going to talk about the pros and cons on both sides and the two biggest considerations that you have to make one is what's the goal that you're actually solving for believe it
(00:44) or not the reason that this thing is really fast is also the same reason why it's not going to make you a billionaire on the second problem or the second thing that you have to consider is what problems are going to come up for each of these businesses and which ones you're better at solving the problems that are in this business or the opportunity in this business and the problems in this business are the opportunity in this one and that's why this thing can be mega mega big takes a little longer this one can get
(01:08) moderately big really fast but really hard to scale from there so let's dive in coaching information education digital Course membership businesses are among the easiest businesses to get to $100,000 a year $100,000 a month $200,000 a month but this is what the business looks like in terms of the difference between that and a traditional business a digital course business looks like this in terms of the speed a traditional business looks like this and so the key thing to make this decision really only comes down to two
(01:43) factors and they're both incredibly important but they're very simple to understand so the first one is what is your goal if you want to sell a business and build an asset that you can exit for 25 50 100 $250 million a billion dollar someday then this business the coaching digital Etc businesses are not a good business for that and all we have to do is look around and see okay of the people who don't have a brand who started from scratch and had information businesses how many of them were able to get to $10 million per year how many to
(02:16) $30 million per year how many to $100 million per year the amount of guys at 100 million I can count on one hand and I know them all and all of them have deep Brands and have been doing it for 30 plus years almost all of them the people at $30 million year there's probably I can count on two hands and I almost know all of them and think about how many people are in this space there's Millions if you count creators of people in the information digital product space and so that's a very very small success rate even at 30 million a
(02:46) year and so what's interesting is that there's this massive band of people at the 500 million2 million $3 million a year because it is a business that requires almost no operational infrastructure to get to that level you can get get to $2 to $3 million a year with a team of 10 that for most entrepreneurs is where they cap out in terms of their operational skill set they don't know how to lead they don't know how to manage so the first thing you have to figure out is what your goal is and the second is what problems you
(03:14) are more comfortable solving all right let's walk through this so if your goal is to make let's say $1 to $3 million per year in a business this is probably the fastest and easiest way to get there you have no inventory you can immediately package the knowledge and experience that you have you can deliver very outsized value to a very Niche audience so for example gym launch I knew how to run a gym there is no school for running a gym and so if you're a gym owner learning from thousands of other gyms and getting the
(03:45) best practices off the bat because there is no book for running a gym no textbooks right I tried to write one but there's no there's no real book on it and so no one tells you how to set up a membership sale no one tells you what the script is no one tells you how to set up your lobby no one tells you what hours are the ones that are empty and which ones are full no one tells you how long to make your sessions no one tells you how to pay how to pay your trainers all of these things you have to figure out on your own and it's and it's so
(04:06) valuable if you can immediately learn the stuff and then triple your income that's incredibly valuable but it's not sticky once you teach someone they know it that's why fouryear degrees are four years not forever you learn it you graduate and so for that reason they become very difficult to create Revenue retention with as in people buy it and then they leave so that is why this business is very hard to to turn into an asset because the recurring nature of it is very low and on top of that you have three types of key man risk so if you're
(04:38) a personal you're an influence you got a personal brand you're the one who's bringing the customers you're the one who's leading the team and you're the one who's delivering the product if you're the one who's required to make the ads then no one's going to buy the business and say okay well we're just going to get rid of the guy who makes all who gets all the customers in well that's not going to happen let's say you magically replace yourself on the front end well you're still the one who's in charge of making the thing that delivers
(04:58) all the value which is the product and the one who's staying on top of it seeing what's working right now and all that stuff and if you're not doing that then they're like okay well maybe we can replace this but eventually the product is going to deteriorate and we're going to be out competed by people who are newer and better and so okay fine then you have to replace that these are both very hard problems to solve and then finally the entire team's loyal to you and they started working because they probably watched your content or
(05:19) consumed your ads or in some way they aspire to be like you in some way or they admire certain traits about you and so if they're like well if you leave I'm leaving and so you have this infrastructure of people who also don't want to work for anybody else and so there's huge risk from an asset perspective to sell or exit this company and so if you want to make this as income and just think about this as getting a really high paying job then this is a great opportunity but now I want to talk to these people so I had three different
(05:47) business owners and this is why I'm making this video recently one was a guy who had a paint paint business who's doing 4 million bucks a year uh another was a salon owner doing about 3 or four million bucks a year uh she had uh six locations doing lash extend exensions and other stuff like that and then the third business was a business was a a business opportunity like a micro business where he would set up home gardens in people's backyards like that was his that was his thing and people would pay him to do that and so he could
(06:12) teach other people how to set up Gardens in other people's backyards Etc okay so almost all of these guys were right here they had enough skill that they could teach a beginner but not enough skill to be a master so they could jump from here and based on the time in the business they'd be like here like if you look at this amount of time to here they would jump all the way to here on their income they'd jump higher up on that graph But as time continues to go on this way this graph as time goes on goes off the chart and this one is very
(06:53) difficult to get there especially if you have a exit meaning somebody buys your business because you built an asset that does not rely on you when you have 60 locations and you're not the one in the ads and you're not the one delivering the Lash extensions that's a very sellable business and what I can also promise you is that to get from 1 to five going from 55 to 60 locations you're going to make more money at 55 to 60 and it's going to cost you almost no time but most people quit right when they reach a boss that they don't know
(07:27) how to beat and what's interesting about this is that the cap on this business and the cap for most people in local in Lo in Chains or traditional service businesses is about the same it's because they don't know how to get the next level of leadership in and so they're able to get the first team in maybe one manager but they can't get the next level of leadership in that's what takes you from five locations to 25 to 30 locations that's going from one city where you've got three to five to five cities we have three to five if you're
(07:57) thinking locations but you can think about this as an accounting firm it doesn't really matter but fundamentally you have another layer of leadership which is why people get stuck and so if you are in this business then you just need to realize that you're about to get the best returns that come at the end and not get the shiny object now if you are in this boat and you deceive yourself and you say you know what I love making an impact I love helping people with their businesses more than I like I like paint pain help I like
(08:31) helping paint owners make more money with their paint business than I do like helping homeowners paint their houses fine but guess what that will one wear off when I was in the gym business in the beginning I was like I love Fitness but guess what it very quickly became not about Fitness it became about business and so once I got my H 100th and 500th and thousandth weight loss testimonial and before and after I stopped caring it's just like I I got numb to it because I had so many testimonials just like yeah you know you
(08:59) you you ate less and you did resistance training and you got stronger and you built muscle and like yeah like your body changes that's kind of the point and the thing is is that right now this is novel it's new now you're like oh wow I you know this guy was able to move houses and go into a new zip code and his kid went to a new school and he's got time for his family and as crazy as what I'm about to say will sound you will get used to it too it'll be the same as the other thing because you're going to say well I mean dude it's not
(09:26) you'll start downplaying you're like listen man I mean you ran some ads that you that we already knew worked and you ran an offer that was better and you set up a sales process which you didn't have and you had a script which you also didn't have when you run that thing you're going to make more money and so it it's it starts the The razzled Dazzle around it starts to go away it's just exciting because it's new and so my first big piece for either of these people is do not straddle their line you've got one ass that's an ass okay
(09:52) you can't ride two horses pick and it's the fundamental skill of entrepreneurs being able to make a decision and if you can't make a decision and you can't commit and acquisitions.com we Define commitment by eliminating Alternatives when you get married you eliminate all other women or all other men that you're going to be dating that's how you commit you say I will eliminate all Alternatives and so if you want to commit to either of these things it means you need to eliminate the Alternatives focus is the measure of
(10:20) the amount of things that you say no to so somebody who says no to more things is more focused than somebody who says yes to more stuff period so if we're looking at these two opportunities this if you want to be in this range then great then this is a good opportunity but understand that this will cap and it will get very difficult to scale which goes to problem number two so I'll write the goal here real quick if you want to have a $10 million plus exit then sticking with the traditional business is the better model now real
(10:59) talk over 5 years you might make that an income over here and not be able to exit the business but you'll have made that an income and so there are lifestyle benefits so here you'll make more income faster and you'll sustain a higher you'll be able to sustain a higher Lifestyle the whole ride and so that's also a little bit of a trade-off so here you usually have to reinvest more of that cash into opening new locations into hiring better people whatever less so than you do in a digital products or education business so that's a pro or
(11:29) con depending how you want see it now the second element of this is what problem are you more comfortable solving so if you're in this business you're going to have huge key man risk which is you have to figure out how to transfer everything that makes you special to other people without making them so special that they leave your business and take your customers very very hard on top of that you're going to be in the talent and training business and if you really really want to scale then you have to build a brand because acquisition will only
(12:06) become more and more expensive as you get to colder and colder audiences which means you need to build positive brand associations with you over time which means the product needs to consistently be very very good so you get good reviews good word of mouth and that continues to compound in time rather than compound against you which is what happens for most people because they make medial products because they only are a little bit better than most people not way better than most people so the problem that you have in this business
(12:29) on the other side of sticking with the thing that you're in if you're in a let's say you're the painting business you're the accounting business you're the whatever business the problem that you have to deal with is that it's slower in the beginning this is faster in the beginning slower near the end this is slower in the beginning faster near the end so number one it's slower number two it typically has more Capital involved you have to reinvest more of the money to continue to grow it especially if you have brick and mortar
(12:56) locations you literally have to spend money to open a new location to expand capacity here there is no Capital expense to to sell more people into your membership sell more people into your course not really you just have more people you have to hire but that's it so in this business it takes longer and it costs more money but because it takes longer and it costs more money there are fewer people who do it successfully and as a result they create something that we can put here in big letters which is you create an asset you create something
(13:29) that someone some else could own and so what I will say here is that if you stick with it from here to here and you get good enough that you really understand all the Special Sauce about the business you might not ever want to tell anybody about it because you want to own the whole thing and I'll say like ad acquisition.
(13:49) comom the last chain we recently purchased it was a franchise and it had more franchise locations open than it had corporate and I bought all of the franchises out and so we took all 30 plus locations in house and made them all corporate and we did that because I looked at the economics and I was like wait a second why would we want to make 8% when the amount of work that it takes to open a franchise location is 50% of the work that it takes to open a location we own the whole thing on anyways and with franchisees and customers by the way you can't fire
(14:23) them with because they paid you if you have employees and you have a bad manager you swap them out and so we have more control and we can know that they're going to execute correctly the amount of franchise or buddies I have I can't even count and they all say the same thing man these franchisees are idiots they all think they're smarter than me they all want to do it their own way right and their own way is the wrong way and so they end up making less money and they don't do it right and so then all of a sudden your reputation tanks
(14:50) because they're not following your process and it's a whole cycle and so there's a reason Panda Express is a significantly more valuable company is that Mr Panda owns them all he owns all the net income from every single location and he owns the dirt and he owns the property itself all 2600 did almost 4 billion in sales with 27% net margins absurd 27 net margins it's almost a billion a year in income income cash flow woo but he didn't start coaching other Chinese restaurant owners when he had five locations he just stuck with it and
(15:29) so it goes back to what goal do you have if you want to build an asset that eventually will require less of you less work and give you ultimate Freedom this business model will do it if you're looking to make a 100 500 a million bucks two million bucks a year and are willing to continue to work and basically always have to keep working in order to do that then this is a good business model reiterating this if you're here right which is at this early part here then this model is the faster and easier way to make a million $2
(16:03) million dolls a year it is if you want this and you're further along in this curve then for most of you it would make sense to just stick with what you're doing because you're about to unlock this huge amount of value that's going to get created and so I want to give you an even-handed approach to thinking about this and understanding that you also may be let's say you're at this point and your goals might actually change and so when I was starting out if someone's like hey you can make a million bucks a year I'd be like screw
(16:32) asset value I don't care about exits I was like I just want to make money in which case great vehicle but what happens and the reason that you can look at Alex Becker who I think got up to $25 or $30 million a year in his information business switched to hyos and then built a multi million doll Enterprise with software Sam ovens had consulting.
(16:50) com they were doing 30 plus million doll a year and then from all the skills he learned transferred to school.com and then made it significantly more valueable Enterprise right now mind you School makes less cash flow than consulting.com because this business requires more capital and is slower at the onset school's in year five or six right now right but it's scaling like this now because it's easier to add 5,000 customers in a month in this business and almost impossible to do it here especially if you have Service attached
(17:24) to it and so there are pros and cons on both sides and you have to realize that your goal will change and if you do get to this point where you're right at this point where you're like well shoot because sometimes people go the other way they say hey I've been doing this for 5 years I want to start a software company look at all the people who are successful with software companies who made the switch let me tell you the one Comon trait because I know all of them they stopped this and they started doing that and so in either
(17:55) direction if you're going to do it do it and don't do the other one so I want to talk to Avatar number three hidden bonus is somebody who's been successful here for 5 years or someone who's been moderately successful here for 5 years the other side looks really tempting because if you're over here you've got enough cash saved up you've been making a million bucks 2 million bucks a year for a while and you're like man now I want to have that 10 20 50 $100 million plus exit right I get it I was there on the other hand if you're here you're
(18:25) like man I've been I've been putting five plus years in this thing I want to start making some money I want to start making some cash flow and so this starts looking attractive and I'll give you the quote from my CFO there's in every business and so the key here is let me walk you through the transition on either side if you're going from traditional business over to digital education business what you don't want to do is keep the traditional business and so there's the fallacy of like well one some of you want to keep it because
(18:55) you're afraid of actually making the jump and this is actually what makes you money in which case just keep doing what you're doing but if you really are going to make the jump then there's this idea that you want to have keep a test kitchen and I actually think it's not true so let me explain so the concept of a test kitchen is works when you're making food because you want to standardizing process and you roll out the food making process across all locations it's much easier to roll it out you have franchise control or you
(19:22) have corporate control whatever now if you're in an education business you teaching your employees on site how to do do a new process or do a new play is not how you're going to teach all the people in your community all the people who are your customers that buy your stuff from you from an education perspective what are you actually going to do you're going to probably record some videos and add some sort of Zoom call you know add-on to help give support maybe some Community Support as well but that's about it and so if you
(19:50) want to test whether or not a new play is going to work in this education model then test it like you would actually roll it out which is if you have 100 customers take 10 customers that represent different segments of the market both geographically like what Market are they in and what skill level they're at and so when we ran things at gym launch I wouldn't say let me take the top 10 gyms and test something out because that's going to give me bad data I'm going to have the top 10 winners they're going to make everything work
(20:18) but if I take the bottom 10 on everything nothing's going to work but if something does work for them it's going to definitely work for everyone and so what I did was I took two people from each of the 20% bands so two people from the top top 20% % two from the next 20 next 20 in the middle next 20 the bottom middle and then next 20 at the very bottom so I had 10 people in different markets at different skill levels and so when I rolled it out I got to have a representative sample of both markets and performance to see whether
(20:42) this play actually worked and I see that as a far superior model to actually creating better products and better education that also doesn't require you to keep an appendage of a business that you have to stay attached to because whether you like it or not if there's a problem in this business and you know a a client sleeps with a uh an employee right or an employee stealing guess what's taking your shower time I don't care if this is 10% of your income it's going to take 50% or 100% of your mental bandwidth until the problem goes away
(21:11) your brain is going to deal with what's urgent not necessarily what's important and so this is why Focus is so important so if you're going to switch from here to here cut it sell it don't have any appendages and go all in on this if you are going to go from the education business over to a more traditional business like software or service business that you want to attach to it then guess what you cut this business you say I'm done with that and I'm going to build this for real just don't straddle the line I've yet to see anyone
(21:40) succeed big doing this and the vast majority of people do exactly that which is why I'm making the video so you have your three scenarios you're starting out you just want to make income then yes digital products education businesses is probably the fastest and easiest way to make a lot of money pretty quickly if you want to build an asset that's going to be valuable and sellable without you and you're comfortable with a slower pace of growth and putting more capital in this is something that's going to give you a 1050 $100 million plus exit
(22:08) if you're going to make the transition then pick if you are in this bucket and you're like that is cool I don't necessarily want that right now that's not the stage of the journey I'm at we have a free thing that you can do at school.com games where I will lead you through starting your business right now 50 54.
(22:29) 1% of of people who start the school games with the paid Community make their first dollar online very very proud of that if you are this business and you're trying to get to here you want to have a massive exit then acquisition. comom every once in a while we run workshops at our headquarters we help businesses that are smaller than our portfolio size kind of take the next step so that hopefully someday maybe we're the ones who buy it from you and help you scale it from 30 locations to 300 that being said this is the path I want to make it clear for you give you the pros and the
(22:53) cons on either side and hopefully get you to commit one way or the other

Transcript:
(00:00) so you want to make money online but you don't want to feel icky or sleazy to the people who know and love you when you ask them to give you money so there's a good way to do it and there's a bad way to do it the good news is I can show you step by step how I got my first 20 clients posting on social media for my personal training business a decade ago and I've continued to use that in each company going forward and this is a sneak preview from my upcoming book 100 million dollar leads which you can check out at acquisition.com forward slash
(00:25) leads so there was a friend of mine who had a podcast that blew up and very quickly he had millions of downloads and his business started to grow it skyrocketed and it was almost 100 from people who were listening to his podcast and what happened was he made an ass during one of his podcasts he made a lot of money he thought when I make an ask I make more money and so what I'll do is I'll just make more asks he learned the wrong lesson and so he did make more asks and he then made a little bit more money and then he would continue to make
(00:50) less and less and less until eventually his listenership dropped and dropped and dropped because he had lost the Goodwill of his audience the key point I'm going to talk about today is mastering the gift ask ratio how much to give versus how much to ask garyvee popularized the whole concept jab jab jab right hook which is the idea of giving giving giving and then ask it not take but ask the good news is this ratio has been incredibly well studied why because the biggest media companies in the world want to be able to ask on their
(01:20) platforms as much as humanly possible without losing viewership listenership audience on television for every 47 minutes of content there's 13 minutes of advertising if you look on Facebook every four posts there's one ad it's almost like a three to one ratio between how many ads there are and how much content there is what I want to do is give you my slight tweak on the give give ask concept instead of give give give ask I'd like to just change it to give until they ask you and that's when you know your audience is ready for you
(01:56) to make an offer and my personal preference here is actually to give in public and sell in private whenever you give you deposit Goodwill into the audience if you give someone something first they're far more likely to comply with your request later when someone helps us we feel indebted to them we want to help them back right that's how Society works but with media we can do that at scale you can gain Goodwill and provide value to millions of people at once but then it all funnels back to one person and that's why it's so powerful
(02:21) and it's free when you do it that way your brand consistently is reinforced publicly and you continue to grow and expand it will force you to keep that content amazing so that you continue to reinforce your reputation if you consistently give and give and give then what happens is your audience compounds and this is something that I didn't understand for a long time the audience is the asset not the content you make so when I make a video and then it disappears in three days on my news feed what that one piece of content is is it
(02:47) got me 300 more people to start seeing my stuff and then they permanently enter the audience provided I don't ask too much too frequently in the beginning it'll be really small and if you can hold off and you keep giving you keep giving you keep giving you eventually never even have to ask publicly because instead of asking you just start getting transparently this is something that I've now personally experienced and I was like I don't know but you know what I'll give it a shot let's just see if I can make a bunch of business content and
(03:12) see if that will attract one million five million 10 million dollar profit per year businesses not Revenue profit so that I can invest them and help them grow and it turns out it did now there's two ways that asks work in content and so I want you to think of your asks as commercials you're interrupting your own content with a commercial about your stuff an integrated approach would be like during the content like hey if you want to learn more about this stuff go to 100 million dollar leads 100 million dollar leads is coming out and there are
(03:38) eight methods that I talk about advertising and by Design I'm using all eight to advertise this book and at this point we already have 200 000 people who have registered for the book launch live which is on this day Saturday August 19th so that would be an example of an integration it's natural it comes up as you're talking and then you can point to it and you get back to what you're saying Integrations work better for long-form Content books videos pod podcast blog post those are all things that lend themselves to integrating in
(04:05) very small percentages of the total amount of time it takes someone to consume something for example if I made an integration and I started with a minute about something valuable and then I spent five minutes in the middle talking about my thing you still need to keep the ratio of minimum three to one because remember television's 13 minutes to 47 right for a 60 Minute slot in terms of commercials so that's the Max and so for me I would rather be at like 98 give two percent ask so if we looked at the total seconds of this video the
(04:32) give to ask ratio is still super strong and I'm not going to lose audience because of that ask the other way is intermittent which means in between things intermittent is typically better for short form platforms if you have 10 Instagram posts or 10 Tick Tock reels on the 11th one you make one about your services that you offer and then you go right back to the pre-programmed show it's even harder because if you're doing multiple posts a day I wouldn't do more than three percent so once or twice a month one post that feels reasonable and
(05:03) you're not gonna lose audience and so fundamentally the actual cost of the commercial is not money but Goodwill how much of my audience am I losing by making this ask I though to be clear I always want to under ask my audience personally so if you're new to making content believe it or not you've actually been providing value to certain people for an extended period of time it's you actually do have a decent amount of Goodwill if you make your first post what I would just call like a declaration of business which is just
(05:29) saying like hey you know you guys have maybe been following me for a while you might know me you might not from personal from College from work from out of the bars this is what I'm doing with my life now and I would love to give you guys something for free that would benefit you and if that sounds cool awesome if not keep following me be posting more about this stuff very quick very simple and I was actually able to find my first public decoration of business which is here this is April 9th I'm actually coming up on uh 10 years I
(05:53) hit my decade in business how about that for those of you know me you know two things one I am terrible with all things technology logical still true for example I just heard about Spotify a few weeks ago seriously two I love training slash nutrition and fitness more than well a whole lot so today is sort of special because it marks a day when my love of training vanquished to see me trying to use fancy words Vanquish my fear of Technology what do I mean for the better part of a year I've been taking part in a free personal training
(06:16) project that I would give away free personal training to anyone who's willing to give 500 to a thousand dollars to a cause of their choice give value for an extended period of time for a small group of people to prove that you know what you're doing so you can get testimonials by the way this way they wouldn't have to be motivated by the same thing as me but be motivated to give to their cause and benefit themselves when I first introduced the idea I was happily surprised the amount of positive sport I received so almost a
(06:37) year for my first client I now have a website to formally show some of the transformation that I've gone underway using my programming and as a formal means of contacting me about signing up I currently have a few slots open on my roster so drop me a quick note if you're interested thanks so much take a second to check out some of these ridiculous transformations in record time would I make this post again today probably not but I'm proud of the kid who did it because I had given value for free to people free because they didn't pay me I
(07:05) had them pay someone else because I wanted them to Value it but making that first Declaration of business post was actually how I got my first 20 paying customers I got 20 people who message me because because I to be fair I had always been in shape and people had known me my whole life as a guy who was always obsessed with Fitness so it made sense that I would make that my next natural thing and so you've provided value to people for a long period of time you can make your first post a light ask which is just declaration and
(07:29) asking for support and then you can start the business now if you have no content up to that point show them what you've been up to and then you can make your ask I would encourage you to make that first post because I think it'll show it's possible and I think if I can get you that first win you'll be far more likely to continue and if you're wondering well at what point do I fully right hook my audience and just drain it of Goodwill Real Talk part of the game is quote leaving money on the table so let me give you an example friend of a
(07:53) friend had a tequila business that was pretty big big enough that the rock approached him Dwayne Johnson and The Rock said I would like two-thirds of your business and mind you when you did that that might have been a big ask I don't know they said no now fast forward years later the rock started his own tequila brand which is now worth 6 billion so they probably would have made out really well with that but here's the thing if the rock had done that deal at that time he might have actually lost out on what he ultimately made with terramada and so
(08:25) that means if someone says hey Alex can you endorse my thing if I say yes today it's probably going to be a bad deal for me because in two years my audience would be significantly larger and so will yours when you're thinking about these right hooks there's a huge time component and the thing is is that compounding gets crazy near the end every time you decide to make the right hook if you hold it it could be 10 or 100 times bigger 12 months 24 months later could you imagine if two years ago when I started making content and I just
(08:53) started getting early engagement my YouTube videos and Instagram and people start dming me they're like hey can you Mentor me which I don't do if I had said sure I'm gonna do it I would have stopped my growth curve and I would have just been just another dude but by holding back and it takes a lot of self-discipline self-control and patience which by the way if you want the definition for me operationalizing patience is just figuring out what you do in the meantime you don't actually wait you just figure out what you do in
(09:17) the meantime because I am in the game of making money my goal is to always have significantly less Supply than I have demand and I always want to keep that demand because that is the Holy Grail of what you want Which is far more people who want to do business with you than you have capacity to do so the strongest driver of pricing power and profits is supply and demand when we make content what we're actually doing is artificially Shifting the demand curve in our favor and the other side of this is that if you are the business owner
(09:45) you control Supply and so you can inflate your demand and at the same time cut your supply and when you have that happen price goes through the roof and so do your profits I'm all about growing as fast as I possibly can which means you got to give as much as you possibly can just keep giving and people will start coming to you you'll start not even having to ask you'll just start getting and if you're going to ask because you need to put food on the table which I understand for me I would be way more than the three to one ratio more like 10
(10:10) times that would be like a 30 to 1 ratio of giving to asking so I keep maximizing my growth and keep my brand compounding while still making a little bit of money for me because I know that long term the more I hold back my ask the bigger it will be

Transcript:
(00:00) so if you doubled Revenue across all of these you'd already be at five and that's probably about 6 months of work yeah yeah so this is Raymond he's a chiropractor does $5 million a year and this is Alex I'm an investor and I make all the money that I have a golden share with diamonds that I sit on at bed and I just count how much money I have and the point of today is I'm going to try and help Raymond take his chain to the next level hey Alex uh my name is Raymond coer I'm the founder of Kyo first of
(00:23) Washington so just a little bit above my business uh we currently have six brick and mortar locations trilling 12 months Revenue 5.2 million uh you better have around roughly 1.2 million and our net profit is about 23% do you buy those or did you open up uh organic so far I've bought all of them oh really okay yeah but I think moving forward we're going to change our strategy a little bit so overall the company's doing well 5.
(00:47) 2 million 23% margin healthy I was curious whether he opened them organically or he bought them because there's basically two big expansion strategy either buy or you build and so he chose a buy strategy that initial kind of sorting told me okay these are the types of questions and problems I need to look out for as he goes through the rest of the presentation so what's the goal my three-year goal is to try to get to $5 million Eva um I want to try to build a business that can run individually but then I also want to entertain um selling to an Institutional buyer so this is
(01:11) very much a prity what we talk about so when someone says they're trying to build it to sell it versus build it to keep it I see both of those as basically the same path it just shows how much they want to work like super longterm either way all paths lead to building a better business so who do you help specifically our key demographic that we help is 35 to 65y old men and women uh that have some kind of condition that we can help with whether it's pain discomfort or lots of movement insurance or cash we're about 75% Insurance oh interesting okay how do you help them so
(01:39) the way we help them is uh when when someone comes into our office uh we'll design a custom treatment plant for them that might be over a period of 60 to 90 days uh it might include chiropactic rehab and spinal decompression right so spinal decompression kind of differentiates us from a lot of our competitors because it's a niche service that we offer um for people that have disc related injuries is that like stretching people out kind of thing yeah okay exactly well how do you make money our offer so basically on the front end uh we offer a free consultation so then
(02:08) when the patient comes in our packages can range from 2400 to 3600 uh over a 60 to 90day period we're primarily a reoccurring Revenue model mhm and roughly one out of every seven of our patients they come in for a larger case value so like a car accident or work injury might be worth up to $10,000 well right off the bat I think the reason that he's been able to expand is that making a decent amount of money and so typical you know chiropractors who don't know business will sell one crack at the back at a time uh whereas he's already
(02:38) selling High ticket packages which is the right direction to go for you know a premium service and he obviously has a super premium with this whole kind of insurance $10,000 thing and so it's like right off the bat his price points are right what's what's advertising how do you find him for paid advertising the number one is Facebook ads so we spend about 1,000 bucks per location on that uh the second one is Google ads so we're spending roughly 500 to a th000 per month on on each location okay got it uh
(03:01) so what's sales velocity how many do you sell per month on average we're we're getting about 35 leads uh per month um and out of the 35 we have 28 that show okay it's pretty good and so we have a show rate about 80% that's great um and our closing rate is about 71% so total sales probably roughly around 20 cool solid numbers so right off the bat Raymond's got really strong show rates exceptionally strong close rates and mind you this is one location so we'll see if that's system one which then on some part of my mind I'm like okay when you have super high close rates like that we might need to bump prices like
(03:32) it just shows that the market is willing to spend more and so for me like I would say healthy close rate percentage is usually like 30 to 40% that's kind of like usually where you find The Sweet Spot of price versus number of units sold not always but that tends to be like rule of thumb but by and large it shows that he knows how to get people to shop and he knows how to close what's stay in the way what's the problem if I were to to uh prioritize my constraints what I think they are uh number one I would say is probably lead flow I think
(03:57) that we could do better in that department it's not consistent okay when I had one location it was really easy to predict that and to to change the outcome pretty quickly but as we've scaled i' I'm having a tougher and tougher time to um you know scale the marketing what Raven's dealing with is super common when you go from one location to multiple especially if it's purchased let alone you know organically grown because usually I call it founder magic or owner magic it's like if you have one location it's like your thumb
(04:21) print's on it like your heartbeats on it everybody knows you they they kind of grw up with you everyone kind of knows your Vibe you have old customers who remember you and so it's like always going to be special and different than everyone that you open after that because you're typically just not nearly as entrenched second one would be like our sales infrastructure because we are 75% insurance-based there's so many different plans out there right so we have to when the patient comes in we have to determine what kind of insurance they have by verifying it and then make
(04:44) a customized plan based off of that so if there's a way to to uh streamline that into one day I think it'll be much more effective for us what I personally practiced I was able to do it in one day but I'm having I'm having a tough time training my doctors to be able to do that okay and then uh people operations people operation so obviously when I had one location it was really easy to control the standard right uh but as we expand it's harder and harder to have that same standard okay so let's see the numbers so going over the numbers again so top
(05:12) line revenue 5.2 million last fall months profit 1.2 net margin is about 23% okay um our CAC is about 700 our lifetime value is 3,400 so that's 4.8 to1 um LTB to co ratio uh marketing spend we're spending about 1,500 to 2,000 per location right now the sh rate's 80% close rate 71% and our annual ad spend on marketing is about 110,000 so right off the bat obviously the numbers are really strong the amount that he's spending per location seems low given how much money he's making so I think there's probably opportunity there but I'm just very curious how it actually breaks down between locations because that'll probably give us more
(05:48) insight huh okay do you have any anything broken out between channels between Facebook and Google so this is our our Facebook data um I was able to put together like our our 12-month uh numbers for all the clinics for as okay and then for as far as the the challenge that we have is because we're Insurance based we don't get paid for like 30 60 90 days after so I had to go back and I picked Q2 for three clinics yeah yeah okay um so these are the numbers for for uh for those three clinics in quarter do so looking at this whole sheet I scanned
(06:18) it and then the bottom where you can see Q2 there it's Capitol Hill Everett and Kent and so Kent you see an eight Raz there so that was really strong the lowest CAC by a decent margin and so I wanted to understand whether that was a performance thing or like it just costs less because of a marketpl cost per impression cpms are lower there there might just be more people I wanted to double click into that to figure out why that one's doing so much better than the others okay so why is Kent so much better is the dock there different than
(06:42) the other docks they're about the no's he's he's good but he's he's about the same I I would say that culture of that team is is really good I think that's one thing that stands out cuz cuz CAC is half of Capitol Hill right you're getting more LTV and lower CAC can't right is it that the people that are coming cuz it's insurance so is it that they're like filling better like what like how how could they get LTV to be so much higher do you have any other data that's you collected together yeah so this are from Google AdWords well these obviously do significantly better than
(07:10) your Facebook ads yeah for sure interesting so right off the bat look all the way to the right row ad means return on ad spend so you see 12 to1 24 to1 9:1 I'm seeing really strong roow eyes here and so I'm thinking okay so if I have a machine that I can put a dollar in and get $24 back out I want to put as much money in that machine as seemly possible and so that's why my next question I'm asking how much more can can we spend here this is obviously a profitable channel are you maxed out on spend here uh I don't think I am the I
(07:35) work with a a third party company on this and and I basically go off their recommendations okay I personally would love to spend more obviously on this because the return so high yeah um and these people are in you know immediate need of help yeah so they're much easier the or case acceptance goes up much higher with these patients High intent yeah really good well I mean shoot this is this is the most promising part so if you think about people's willingness to pay being proportion to their spending power and the pain that they're experiencing with it now he literally
(08:04) has people in pain and so when you have someone who's being Interruption based I means like they're just scrolling around and they see an ad they're probably not as in pain as somebody who's like ow I just did something to my back they're on Google they're searching for a solution immediately so the intenses are completely different or rather they're significantly stronger with people that are actually looking for the solution and so I would wager that those people buy faster they buy bigger tickets and we'll see if that's true walk walk me
(08:28) through the sales process so day one patient comes in we do a consultation we take X-rays we'll do an exam and actually start me from click to close so the person clicks on is Google is basically the sales process for Google ads different than sales process for meta or how's it how's it flow for you yeah so Google they will call directly into our we have a centralized uh call center that we have so they'll call in Click to call is the app click to call or click to schedule on our they go to our landing page okay so click a call or or or they self book got it so then they
(08:58) they talk to a rep that's centralized that rep does some sort of Discovery call do they look at their insurance at that point on the call they don't but that's the thing I'm thinking of adding in so we can get on top of that so they they do some sort of Discovery they're currently not doing insurance on the call yep all right so then they do what so then they schedule them uh the the next available time we try to get them in same day or next day right away so some people call and then they book them and the people who self schedu just book
(09:21) directly exactly and then what's the what's the kind of like reminder sequence there to make sure that cuz you have really good shop rates yeah so we do uh three text messages and then we do a pH call uh if if we uh if they don't respond to text message do a phone call the night before to confirm we'll do another one like uh you know 2 hours before their appointment So Raven is describing what appears to be very boring work but is one of the biggest levers that I look at that is often huge holes of revenue for most small
(09:44) businesses that they simply just don't work their leads either well enough fast enough or hard enough they're not responding to them quickly they're not personalizing the reach outs they're not doing it multiple times and they're not doing it in a timely fashion relative to when they're coming in and so he clearly had a system for for work leads like we text him these three times this and we do this and so as soon as someone demonstrates that I'm like okay there's probably not immediate holes in Ling fruit there and his numbers kind of
(10:07) supported that said differently when you see 80% show rates you've got somebody who knows how to work leads okay so three reminders and call if they have not confirmed their and followup call as well if they didn't pick up the first call or the other ones and then if someone doesn't hit any of those five do you pull them off the calendar we don't pull them off the calendar but we we kind of expect them not to just like double book kind of yeah exactly okay yep okay so then they come in so they show up to the appointment now what they come in for their appointment uh we'll
(10:35) we'll do a consultation so we have a patient coordinator that does it that gets the preliminary data it's like an assessment yep ex like movement like move here does that hurt that kind of thing like Z where you have pain kind of like half closer framework okay so like so they'll do the first half of that on there and then uh then we'll take uh x-rays we'll do an exam and then we'll tell the patient that hey we need to process these films or these X-rays and then can we need to get you back in tomorrow so we can go over the results
(10:58) of the X-ray yeah that's where Ling people yeah that'ss okay so then we'll release them for we we'll still do treatment that day we'll do a light treatment and then we'll have them come back the next day and by then by then we'll have everything verified and then we'll have a customized plan for them and then we'll present the fin can you walk me through the ad funnel with the uh Facebook ads we have a video ad out there do you have ads live right now yeah can you um pull up Facebook ads Library we're going to pull them up and we're going to we're going to see it we're going to see we're going to see for ourselves all right so we have different creative it looks like it's
(11:28) the same copy all right so I think there's probably just some work that could just happen on the actual ads themselves like I think you could have a clear call out and the first line I would probably separate the call outs so it's like atten ever in surrounding areas so inste areas I would go to like residents or something like or people basically combine the two where as chronic back pain doesn't have to be life sentence attention efforts for your uh so be like attention ort like residents with back pain that
(11:53) combines both lines punch you put two Asters on either side it's like okay that's what it is and you're putting proof first and I probably wouldn't he I'd probably lead with a question which would be like are you so either I would lead with a question that' be some sort of like more specific pain or I would lead with the offer and then have the proof of why they should believe that I can help them after they've seen the offer cuz like it took us all the way down to actually see what the offer was got it in the headline if you scroll all
(12:19) the way down Michael avoid surgery try spinal and decompression I would probably just put like the offer there so it's just like a restatement like free spinal uh decompression but $99 value whatever something like like that's what I would what I would put there there's a lot of words and I think you could probably get just like I combined the first the headline and the excent into just like attention Everett residence with back pain right it's like boom we got that and then it's like you'd be amazed at how much like just
(12:44) changing tweaking the headline probably compressing the copy into a handful of bullets it's like do you struggle with boom boom boom boom and you probably tried boom boom boom boom but there's a better way this is how we do it we've helped this many people for limited time we're doing X Z and I think I think that would probably work well I cannot guarantee availability we commodate 10 vouchers ofation schedule I do like that could probably be compressed okay like we can only we can only see 10 new patients per week right scheduling availability is first come first serve for this treatment done so I'm walking
(13:15) Raymond through some improvements to his ads and I wrote a book on advertising and in the PID ad section the first part of a re ad is a call out right is getting people to notice the most important the ad right that's that's what this is and so the call out is whatever you do to get the attention of your audience and so there's kind of four ways that I like to do it and the way that I'm presenting for him here is a yes question right which is like it's almost implied so we're saying this audience of people which is local area
(13:38) and then the like do you have back pain or who have back pain is kind of an implied yes and then we're leading with that for the call out which is the most important part of every ad it's the only thing most people are going to read so once you have to call out I use a what who win framework when I'm thinking through ad copy and so he's talking about like avoid surgery so this is opposite nightmare scenario right and so you can basically construct your ads by put piecing these Parts together in the
(14:00) ad copy and then obviously we want to have the offer very clear when we get to the offer section that's where we need to tell them what to do next which is kind of the last part of the app one of the reasons I love doing these is that I get to take some of the experience that I've had from years of work and actually just help other people out and so one I had a chain of six locations so I had to work leads and get people to show up all the time and write ads to get people to do that and then secondarily we had a
(14:22) licensing business that licensed to thousands of brick and mortar locations and so I had to solve these problems at scale across many different markets and so the nice thing is the patterns are the same and you just have to execute them and so I'm glad that I could CH let's go to schedule appointment uh Kent okay so we just go straight to it straight to the booking okay I would see most of our patient schedule like that versus call there's a couple of things that I think we can go over in terms of sales process lead magnets things like
(14:53) that honestly I think a big part of it that's not up here is the Ops in this type of business it's so operation heavy in terms of like kind operational excellence I had a hunch that if he has the same model at all these locations and some of the locations aren't profitable and some of them are the biggest lever is going to be the people who are actually running the system so I have to be really particular about what recommendations I'm going to make if there's very weak Ops and execution behind it and so one it's going to limit the things that I'm going to do and change the priorities of what I'm going
(15:22) to recommend and so a lot of times business owners are like oh I need to change my strategy when the reality is that like the team's just not good enough and need to focus on the team rather than the model you absolutely can run a 10 to1 15 to1 you know uh row well you're already doing on Google but you can do that on Facebook as well um if the offer is right and so right now the offer is like there really isn't one let's just like try this thing um it doesn't even say free once you come over here and then we'll we'll walk through game plan cool cool yep all right let's on there's inconsistent lead flow there's the sales process that I want to
(15:52) look at I think the discovery process need something need a better front-end offer increase ey spend so those are those are the really tactical things that I'll walk through I think that we're going to look at me magnet I think this needs to be better for ads let offer is number one uh number two is yeah copy number three I think we're going to go I think the um Disco process disco dancing the discovery all right number four [Music] process do you have financing oh no you don't have financing because you're Insurance uh we do we do so the decompression is cash so we do offer
(16:39) financing okay do you you have a third party y okay cool then I I W so Raymond has obviously he's got a successful business he's doing 5 million Top Line 1.3 bottom line so he's not he's not doing he's not doing bad and so a lot of my questions were probing questions to see if there was lwh hanging fruit that already exist in the business that we could kind of tweak and immediately increase the profit and revenue of the business and so these are the kind of holes that from asking the questions like oh we can improve something here we
(17:03) can improve something there sometimes I asked and you I was like no that's good you got it all right and move on to the next thing and so to be clear it's not like I'm trying to say like he has all these things wrong he's making money's he's making more than a million dollars a year like he's obviously good at business and so I'm just trying to find the things that I think I can add value that are ideally low operational risk for him to execute Raymond's actually on level six which is all the way over there my arm's not that long of the
(17:25) scaling road map he's at 20 to 49 employees right between all of his locations and to get to 50 he has to do some of these steps now if we're looking at the constraints of his business we can see here that he's having this sales issue so what sales issues occur at level six well closing efficiency on core product drops becomes inconsistent refunds go down but so do closes and so he's in this situation right now just right out of the book I'm telling you like we spent a long time on this and businesses behave in patterns and so to graduate he has to install Better sales training individual coaching and a team
(17:57) Cadence for making sure that they operating at kpi or above so key performance indicator kpi and so this is what he has to do at this level and if you're a business owner and you are curious what stage you're at and what things are kind of plaguing you well you probably know your problems but how to graduate to the next level and how to solve them this scaling road map is totally free and it's personalized to you so you can go to acquisition.
(18:22) comom roadmap just type in your business info and we will send you the road the the stage that is specific to you across all eight functions of the business so product marketing sales customer service it recruiting HR and finance you'll have all the problems and the solutions to get the next level it's one of the most valuable things I can give you it's absolutely free go check it out and if you by the way want to have us take a look at your business uh on the thank you page you can book a call you can come out to our headquarters and our team would uh love to kind of do what we
(18:46) do here uh with you okay so we're going to start let's actually you know that's actually not a bad not not a bad order okay so um starting with the lead magga I think that offering $19 $29 somewhere in there first consult or free x-ray or something to that extent would probably go way better um and I do like especially for your your type of business to do a low ticket and so it's something like this so be like $29 uh x-ray you know plus you know assessment blah blah blah and the reason I like this is because you get the credit card on the phone okay and even though it's an insurance thing it's like
(19:28) Y no worries we just put a card down just for for show rate obviously we have a doctor who's going to be there we to make sure that you're going to show right and the thing is that if we build them the 29 then the likelihood show up is super high and this is literally just to take show up rates to like basically 100% so then and this is over the phone so this you do that's a phone I did this in front of some gen Z kids and they're like What's that like Jesus all right you'll recognize it so we do this now
(19:51) when they walk in the door okay so this is going to be a little bit of a departure okay yeah so they walk in the door and when you um and I think the reason that you probably sold better obviously you're better at sales than probably your your docs are but if you think about how sales works so sales you want to sell at the point of greatest pain not the point of greatest satisfaction so let's say to be a normal person they're right at the middle of this line right now they're they're having a bad day because now they're in
(20:18) pain right then all of a sudden they get something fixed now they're even better than normal if you're a Salesman where do you sell do you sell when they're here when they're in pain or do you sell here when they're super happy at the point of greatest satisfaction so do you sell it point of greatest deprivation or point of greatest satisfaction AKA pain or value where do you sell here so if I let's say you walk into my restaurant all right and you're starving and I say hey here's a steak and you eat the steak and then after you eat the steak I say hey how was the steak you say oh my God was the best steak of my life amazing and I say great
(20:55) would you like another steak you might be like I mean no but I mean hey the steak was great great like I'm I'm not saying the steak was bad I'm like why don't you want to buy another steak you said it was so good why don't you want to buy another steak does this sound familiar cuz I hear some sales calls from businesses like well if it was good then why aren't you buying more because you're selling at the wrong time now let's play the let's play the play the tape back you walk to the restaurant you're starving I say hey how hungry are you you say I'm starving and I say cool
(21:18) you want two staks you probably be like hell yeah I want two staks I'm starving and then I sell you two stakes you sell at the point in greatest pain not the point of greatest satisfaction now here's where it gets tricky sometimes the point of greatest satisfaction for one thing becomes the point of greatest pain for another so if all of a sudden I help you make more money for example then all of a sudden you have a new problem which is you have taxes and then I say hey with all that extra money that you made I can
(21:50) introduce you to somebody who can help you with your taxes do you want that yes and so where people canate this in terms of ORD is you have to make sure that if you're doing an upsell at the point of greatest satisfaction it's opening the loop of pain for the next problem that you're going to solve through your next product and so it's kind of the same thing here where people are literally coming in pain ideally what I would want to do is we take the assessment instead of doing the treatment then I want to sell the package got it then if you want
(22:19) if they have time they can do it or they can come back tomorrow and get their first treatment got it so it's the same time scale we just move the order around because like I mean I I've been this patient so like I go go to the caropractor they do some thing I'm in pain they adjust my back and then they're like hey uh come back for this but I was like I know I'm good like you you fixed it I'm great totally right and then they're like but it's not a long-term solution and I'm like good enough for me you know like I I'm out and so that might be an immediate like
(22:44) 15 you know 10 to 15% boost in sales so like that's number one but the thing is is that I think that your close rates are going to go up so one is like you're losing some on the drop off right but I think close rates will go up and like when you're in pain your desire for a more like all the desire is there in that moment and we're emotions there we're missing it hey guys this channel I make for you business owners this is all I do every day this is what I love I'm so excited about this new series and so if you have other business owner friends
(23:13) that could benefit from some of the tactics because these tactics work across lots of different Industries not just chiropractors right it would mean the world to me if you just put into a text and you text it to them or you share it to them in a DM CU It ultimately helps more businesses get better and I believe in private Enterprise and I think that's how the world gets saved no one else is coming for us all right back to the video I always had this rule at least like with Fitness is like when someone walks in the door first thing I want them to do is expand the gap of where they are
(23:37) where they want to be so I'd have everybody hop on the scale the amount of people like oh I don't want to hop on this like I know I'm like get on the scale we got to know where it's just a number we got to know where we're at Mak sense and so it's the same idea with this got it okay so uh lead mag in terms of off- ride do you think this would be good this will increase show up rates overall getting somebody to get a $29 credit card purchased with fund is like not hard um they do that that secures their spot then when they come in we do
(24:00) um same day sale mhm now what has been the issue with the docs making this sale like you said they struggled with this so there's two elements you said there was insur like some insurance stuff there so what what's the issue here yeah so the issue is uh patient comes in and then uh we have to verify their benefits so there's there's like 20 different insurances and and every patient has a different like coverage or whatever right yeah so then we got to we have to we have to make our uh treatment plan then take out whatever
(24:26) the insurance covers and then they pay the their co-pay Co TRS so just doing that process um I think when they're on the floor seeing patience and then having to switch gears and uh do the math of like what this you know here's my recommendations here's you know all that I think that part kind of stresses them out how much of it is templated lot most of it like as far as the so we have we know that someone has Blue crossby Shield so whatever yeah yeah it's all exhaust BR you we can punch in number we have financial calculator for that so question so someone call so basically
(24:54) there's two spots that we can put this this process so either we can do it on the phone right with the go yeah or we can do it the moment they walk in the door so it would work like this so someone walks in and say hey do you have your ID on you I just want to confirm your appointment yes I'm Sarah cool great do you have your insurance card on you yeah and so you asked that but that way we can get the templates already like ready to go so that then the doc goes and then he leaves them in there and says cool let me get the x-rays and then he comes in with the x-rays and with a template for their specific
(25:22) insurance totally and then you can just match them and just do the sale yeah so the issue is like some of those some of those so I centralized where they verify those benefits right um some of them could take like 30 minutes to an hour to so if that's that's the okay so then we have to do it with the phone yeah I agree so what we're trying to do here is we're trying to decrease the friction associated with them giving us money and so there are three major levers to providing value the the fourth is obviously the dream outcome that they want to they have to want what you're what you're selling right but the other
(25:53) three correspond to the risk aka the perceived likely of achievement how long they have to wait and what they got to do that they don't want to do or they got to stop doing that they do want to do AKA ease or difficulty so you want it to be easy you want it to be fast you want it to be risk-free what we're doing here is saying okay well he had this big delay in the process that people had to wait another day in order to get the solution presented to them and so wouldn't it be better if we could just have that happen prior to them coming in
(26:16) so that from a speed perspective and a friction perspective they don't have to do anything besides say yes and then we can get we can get paid and they can get helped and for those who are curious that was the value equation chapter in the $100 million offers book The $29 gets in the way then we can still just do the it's like a you can either do a free offer like free x-ray free assessment whatever just if that's an issue I mean personal preference get the credit card and the insurance card yeah over the phone if it seems like a training issue then I would prioritize the insurance card but then that way it's like you already have everything
(26:46) they're pre-loaded and so then they can come out after the x-rays get it printed out from the scheduler the front desk and I mean shoot the morning of add theop print all the print all the the packets out for everyone and then the doc gets them in the clipboard when they walk in the door perfect yeah I mean you think that would work I I think so okay um and then if they ask like hey why do you need my insurance I thought it's $9 bucks then we'll say like hey just in case the doctor thinks he can help you
(27:08) that's want to know while your insurance yeah better I'll give you a different one this is just how we always did it okay so the reason I gave Raymond that line is because it only always works and I'll tell you the story behind this so I used to try and sell free trials and believe it or not there was a time in my life where I couldn't even get people start free trials with me they literally get in their car drive to my gym and i' be like hey you want to 14-day free trial and they would say yeah and I think cool do you want to put you know
(27:33) your credit card down and they'd be like why do you need a credit card if it's a free trial I'd be like I uh I mean it well I know I didn't know it like cuz I want to bill you later like you know like I didn't have anything to say and so one time it just came out and I was like well this is just how we've always done it and and after I started saying that no one objected and so despite how ridiculous that may sound it's unbelievable how well it works so if you're in one of the situations where you have like a tiny little process change or something that you need to do or introduce you know into a sales
(28:01) process like why are you collecting my information now it's like oh that's just how we've always done it and people just know that a lot of employes just do what they're told or they just do whatever someone you know taught them to do it's policy and so then what they do is they just stop asking that person questions cuz they're like it's not really up to me it's it's just like oh this is how we compete our our patient profiles okay perfect like it's better to appeal to policy totally they'll get this if this for whatever reason ISS you you'll
(28:25) you'll prioritize the insurance they'll come in they're going to have the printed out stack yeah of all the insurance the doc gets this on a clipboard yep right in order of the patients that he sees that day um he's like okay Mrs Johnson I've got your X-ray here I've got your insurance here okay this is what we're going to do for you and then this prescriptive close makes sense okay so right now are there some locations that are having like way higher close rates than others or like what's the highest close rate probably I would say Capitol Hill and uh what's the difference though the docker has a lot
(28:53) of certainty no no no uh percentage difference oh um so let's say Auburn is let's say they're averaging about 55 60% okay and then uh Capital Hill might be at like 80% okay no I mean they're both okay you terrible yeah they're not terrible but if you look at um cuz cuz a lot of these people have insurance so their entry level uh like Financial is not like super high on so so the ones that are just 10,000 case they have zero out of pocket yeah so I mean you got you're going to have 100% so kind of so
(29:21) this is how I would so I would imagine that the packages themselves are going to be similar it's just how much is being covered is going to be the difference right yeah and then also the fact that I think if if a clinic sees a lot of those 100% coverage ones then they kind of skip then they start they don't work on their sales skills for the ones that are and then they can say oh these are crappy leads or shitty leads or whatever yeah but just cuz you have to work a little bit for them right so I think just creating that training that's
(29:45) that's how I'm you to train them and role play more I'll give you something that will help you a lot with brick and mortar so I've done a lot of brick and mortar sales processes in my life and um as much as possible I like them to be like clicks and check boxes when we sell something for example it's like you literally just turn a laptop around and then you just like punch through it and you literally just say the words and then at the point that you ask for the thing you ask for the like you really can machine it that way yeah and that will eliminate so much of the
(30:09) variability between people and so I would look at what the top 80% guy is doing consistently make that into the basically the deck so that they have a visual aid to go through it and then it just feels like oh this is this is the next step I do this this is what you need this is what we cover he circles the thing on their on their thing turns it to them and then they they they rock and roll and then they just book out their next appointments I'm assuming so they're kind of looking at a tele proper almost like okay but they can show it to them okay so there's two ways to do it one is you have the laptop and you turn
(30:37) it towards the customer and then you basically read the words on the slides that is like the perfect sales pitch but with visual aids and whatnot got it the second way of doing it is you have that clipboard M but they don't know what's on the clipboard right and so the clipboard just has the script got it and so it's like cool I'm just ask a couple questions and so you basically go through the sales process and you just look like you're checking off the boxes as you're going through a script but then they always say the script and then
(31:01) the doc can visually showare this which they then staple to the the patient contract that way you know they follow the process and then it just keeps it consistent every time so either of those work I've done them both okay so leads page 207 if you have employees and you want them to do what you want them to do then there's three steps document you make a checklist demonstrate you do it in front of them duplicate they do it in front of you and so right now the who's actually doing it is that he wasn't the the salesperson he did say he is good at sales though and say okay I need you to
(31:32) document this by putting this into a checklist give it to someone else for them to follow it so now that you have it in a checklist now you follow it in front of them so they can you prove that the checklist works that and if you keep changing things while you're not using the checklist then keep changing the checklist until you actually follow it and then once you have the checklist right have them followed in front of you and then once that happens then you've been able to duplicate the skill into somebody else and that's going to be a huge issue or rather a huge opportunity for Raymond and his business so the next
(31:57) one is I think ad spend needs to go up so what cuz you're not spending very much yeah I know you know it wasn't until I had to do this process I was like we can because the return is so high on some of those things and if I I mean I would spend like a million dollars a month on Google AdWords if I could yeah yeah so how do we like I guess that would be one thing to increase well the first thing I would do is just literally tell them like I need you to double the ad spend and I need you to find more keywords so
(32:21) just find more for me got it the other thing that might be worth looking into um would be uh local SEO okay because SEO especially for intent based so it's like obviously there search but it's not hard to win at SEO locally like nationally you want to win back pain it's good luck but like you want to win Everett you know chiropractor Everett spine Everett pelvic Health Everett low back ever lumbar ever like you mean there's so many sciatic like all those I think you could probably win on longtail keywords so I'll put that as number seven
(32:55) um so right now Raymond is is doing the core for so this is page 49 of the leads book all right so this is about advertising getting leads and so he is currently running payad so one of the core four but I think that he has an opportunity on posting free content on his site to drive SEO if you don't know SEO is it's search engine optimization so that people who have high intent who are looking for a chiropractor in my area or other keyword or longtail terms will get sent to that site to maybe read a blog arle or something that sounds interesting and then while they're on
(33:25) the site they can take one of the call to actions in order to kind of take next steps in the funnel and then one thing that helps us on that I think is we're pretty good about getting reviews we have more reviews than everybody in our cities oh that's great and then I think that helps with the local SEO um but yeah and the the I guess the big question is like with the ad Spin A lot of these so the agencies that we hire like they work with uh many chiropractors right so those most chiropractors don't do what we do which is sell packages of 2400 they do visit
(33:50) to visit which is which is a nightmare um so I think that they base our ads Ben they're recommending our ads Ben based on that but my return on is so much higher than the average guy oh yeah so then out spend everybody totally so if you might have to talk in um in marketer speak for them okay and just give them this a Target CPA like cost to acquire or CPL and just say like listen I can I can pay up to this so like Make It Rain dude if as long as it's under this I'm good if you're managing an agency the more specific you
(34:20) can be the better and so you have to kind of learn some marketing language so that you can talk to them like marketers and I also tell you they'll respect you way more if you can speak their language what you're going to be looking at is either CAC depending on you know what IND it's either CPA or CAC typically CPA means cost per acquisition CAC is cost you acquire a customer both terms fundamentally mean the same thing and or uh CPL so cost per lead I like to kind of break this down into two numbers one
(34:43) number is what I will tell them is my acceptable range and then the number that's actually my acceptable amount because sometimes they tend to overshoot this is just me with a history of agencies and so I'll give I'll build in a little bit of padding between what I tell them and what I'm actually willing to pay but the more you trust the agency the more those two numbers can be closer together because if you build trust build a good relationship the higher up that number is the more traffic they can ultimately send you because they can
(35:06) spend more to get you a customer and would you have when would you consider bringing that all in house um cuz I kind of I hate dealing with these no I get it I get it it probably wouldn't be my priority right now cuz like if I look at this I'm like okay we got 12 to1 24 to1 91 so I'm like we're doing pretty well on this right um and do you not have do you have Google on the other three as well yeah okay it's just not there I picked a one like a high middle low for so that's low 9 to1 is a low one yeah
(35:30) for sure oh that's great jeez okay cool I would say basically I I'd stop it at 5 to one okay and say like so basically double or triple whatever the CPA there currently is and sometimes what you'll find though is that if you can double or even triple how much you can spend to get a customer you might be able to like 10x lead flow it's not like it's not it's not it's not proportional uh because you just all of a sudden you outs spend this many more people to to illustrate that what what I'm explaining to Raymond I'm going to give you two
(35:55) hypothetical examples all right so let's say I say you you could spend $11,000 in scenario one and that'll turn into $10,000 now you might think wow I should do that but wait there's more what if I said you could spend $10,000 and make $50,000 which one would you rather have well hopefully hopefully this one because here you make $40,000 net and here you make $9,000 despite the fact that this is a 10:1 versus here you have a 5 to1 so you have half the efficiency but you have four and change times the
(36:34) amount of absolute return and I see many small business owners get stuck in this trap of being like I have to optimize this I have to optimize this and you do to a degree but at some point sometimes you just got to spend more you need to expect efficiency to drop at scale it's just part of the game cool so local SEO add that in all right so let me do this so what I want to do is I want to reorder these okay um so that you have kind of like next steps does that work yeah okay sweet I feel like we can I feel like we're making profit I I like that pres I like the
(37:03) doing it before this makes total SI dude it's it's all it makes all the change in the world so what I'm about to outline is the next six months of work for Raymond and I would say a relative amount of increase that these tactics can do for his business and so one of the key parts of laying out a plan like this is making sure that the person has the right resources and that they're doing them the right priorization order right if there's something that takes 5 minutes and can double the business well
(37:25) let's do that first and I tend to say the heavier things for later unless it it absolutely has to be done first and the other ones are contingent on the execution of that and so by and large I will do light work high impact first and then often times there's the heavy work heavy impact that has other things that tail or are attached to it as the order of operations for him now we started this whole conversation around operations to make sure that they had the right people in the right seats to actually execute these strategies and so that's also something I'm taking into consideration when I'm laying out this
(37:57) plan so I'm going to use black here so we're going to go um in order so number one oh you're good as increase Google spend so that's number one and you're going to try and spend as much as you possibly can Facebook wead magnet $29 offer three tighter ad copy what I would do honestly is I would look at so this is how I would how it how i' spy on some  so I would look for chiropractor agencies that specialize in higher ticket and then I would look at their customers okay and then I would look at their ad accounts and then I'll bet you that they run the same ad copy that seems to work really well for all of them right and that's where I would look
(38:46) at for if I was like if I had to do my 1.0 version okay so number four um this is going to be the credit card plush insurance card uh setter this is cool number F there we go number five print out morning of insurance plans six um we need the sales manager to take over the process right manager takes sale one location test if it works well you can roll it out yeah I already do that oh perfect I got that right I would add in local SEO to get more traffic this is a long-term investment though but I think it's so worth it for what you're trying to do because the thing is SEO is going to have the highest return yeah for sure
(39:44) like in terms of Ro so to actually it be more profitable it's just like you got to be able to wait a year but you're looking at a multi-year timeline so I think it's just going to be worth it and that's it's not worth doing that like with all my individual locations yeah you just ranking each of the yeah each of those local markets and then like as soon as you know you're going to open up another one it's like you just yeah exactly you start spinning it out I'll just put a sub Point here same day God I love that four
(40:08) step sale and we'll add in sales preo SL checklist for integer so I think if we do these things we put a little estimator here I think this is probably an easy 2X in terms of lead flow and and making more money this can absolutely double the return that you're doing there this kind of these two are together so I'll just like mute there this is probably going to give us the 10% back that we're that we're losing between day one and day two right now so this is plus 10% now this one I think like the thing is with this one that I like so much is it like doubles the efficiency of each
(40:51) store like this one's like super super sexy because all of a sudden it might be able to take your Kent from like 1.5 to like three and like you might not have to open any more stores like if you could cuz like if you can double Revenue the fixed costs are more or less the same right and so if you doubled Revenue across all of these then you'd already be at five like you'd already be at five in terms of Eva you wouldn't even have to do anything else would that be attracted to the insal Wi oh yeah even
(41:16) small okay yeah got it yeah local SEO is probably like you might be able to get like a 30 to 50% boost okay it'll just take like a year but it's the nice thing is this all margin it's all margin and then the sales pres will probably be ble to smooth out your your closing percentage probably be somewhere like a 20% lift that would be kind of like my guess and so we've got a double a double 10% this could be a double depending this is more in terms of volume right volume this is uh yeah 30 to 50 and probably 20% lift here and that's probably about 6 months of work well dude that's the plan thank you
(41:49) so much dude 100% thank you man so I just sat down with Alex and uh he broke down my business and all the marketing experience that we have and gave me some pretty easy to implement things that we can do to grow right way so Raymond was amazing I'm so pumped to be able to work with him in this business and help him out here this was lots of fun for me probably more fun for me than it even was for him and hopefully even more fun for you and if you like this style of content really tactical business stuff you're going to love the first one of these that I did with Ashley who is a
(42:13) stylist and I think the tactics I laid out there could out many businesses blow up

Transcript:
(00:00) if there were a way to get your business or new product to 2x 10x or 100x overnight would you do it if there are a way to all but guarantee that no matter what business you're in it could become more successful than it currently is would you do it and if you could compress a decade of building a business into weeks would you do it if so this Workshop is for you and using the super influencer process I'll outline in a second will make someone here today enough money to retire that is a promise I would know because I've also used what I'm about to share with you to
(00:41) do exactly that I'm Alex fosi my first big business I scaled at $2.5 million a month which was B2B gym launch was gym licensing my second business was an e-commerce business that sold through an affiliate and influencer program which got to $1.
(01:00) 7 million a month which is B2B to see my third company was a software for lead gen agencies which we grew entirely off of Affiliates and influencers which we got to $1.6 million per month and so I've paid real money to get influencers to promote my businesses just to give you some context I spent over 20 million on influencers to promote Prestige Labs that's the actual checks that's what we that's what I paid out now we made that's what I paid out and in Allen I spent over $22.
(01:26) 8 million on influencers to promote the software those are my actual payouts from our dashboard and I've had over 23,000 Affiliates who promoted my last book $100 million leads that's a screenshot from our uh CRM which helped me sell over a million copies of my last two books $100 million offers and $100 million leads and you can see the slack message from my book manager there and so this process that I'm about to share with you creates real lifechanging value and it allowed me to sell my first two businesses to American Pacific group for 46 .2 million and sell Allen with a
(02:03) trailing 12 month of $12 million in revenue and then use all that money to start acquisition. comom to invest in and scale companies and currently our portfolio together ises about $17 million a month and so I've made Millions using influencers to promote my businesses and I can help you do the same and so I start with this proof because there's a lot of sucky fluff that's being taught out there like this fluff sucks from people who've never done what they claim and simply copy and paste stuff that they don't understand
(02:34) people being like I teach things that I've never done and I refuse to do that and so after spending losing and then finally making millions on influencers I've learned a lot of what not to do but I also figured out a few things that work and so today I'm going to share with you a three-step super influencer process anyone can use to get a flood of buyers into your business for free even and especially if you have no following or money yourself and so here is the three-step process number one know which influencer to pick number
(03:13) two know how to get them to talk to you and then number three I'm going to show you how to get them to promote your stuff because if you know who to pick and you get them to talk to you you get them promote your stuff you will make more money than if you do not and arguably if you pick the right influencer you might make life-changing amounts of money and so think about it this way if tomorrow the rock or Taylor Swift agreed to promote your business do you think your business would grow no matter what you sell be it umbrellas Contracting
(03:45) tequila or VA agencies or whatever it is if the rock got up there and said this is the dude do you think you would make more money obviously of course it would and better yet do you think there's any single move and this is the key point we talk about opportunity cost of the time and effort we put into every move we make in business do you think there's any single move that you could make that would make you more money in less time than partnering with someone like that no probably not so then why on
(04:18) Earth are we not putting all of our time into the one thing that could make you the absolute most amount of money in the shortest period of time I don't know why not and so before I dive in let me explain why taking action what I'm about to share with you with you may be the most important decision in your life all right so obviously option one you could be lame option two do it and change your life so I'm going to opt for option two and hopefully you do too and so there's a reason that this is so important especially right now there's a big shift
(04:45) that's happening in the economy and specifically the economy of attention traditional advertising is dying social media and influencer brands are on the rise you've all heard this but let me show you some stats to support it all right it's the reason that Logan Paul and prime a 2-year-old Company 2 years old is now beating they have more sales than power raid a 36y old company two years 36 and they're crushing them it's the same reason Mr Beast febles a less than 2-year-old company are in the multiple hundreds of millions of dollars a year in sales and they're gaining rapidly on Hershey's
(05:27) which was something that before this time and age was thought to be impossible and it's why so many mega brands are getting launched with influencers like Kylie has her Cosmetics proper 12 with Conor McGregor Kim has skims and you've got Ryan Reynolds with Aviation Jin and he's got a bunch of other brands as well so many of these Mega brands are getting launched with mega influencers or super influencers because they can almost guarantee profitability on day one so think about it like this if you can reach 1 million people for free as long as your product sells for more than
(06:04) it costs you make money period and so the question just becomes which thing will make the most money rather than whether that thing will make money at all so Mr Beast here has to make the decision of am I going to promote Margaritas or am I going to promote chocolate but if he did promote Margaritas guess what he would still make money not as much as he could if he did chocolate but he would still make money and what crazy world can you live in that you can guarantee millions and millions in sales on something that actually has poor product Market fit this is one of those big insurance
(06:42) policies you can take out on the future of your business if you make the right pick and this has never existed before this moment until now and so here's some graphs because everybody likes graphs it's the same reason they're more viewers on internet than they are on television more listeners and they're all radio listeners and even crazier this costs less and converts higher which means that there's more total people watching listening and consuming and more of them buying for less money overall the game has changed yet so few businesses are taking advantage of it
(07:22) and so you can see why this is such a huge opportunity said differently if the only thing between you and the fastest business growth you could possibly imagine was three steps wouldn't be worth doing great I think so too so let's dive in the three-step super influencer process how to pick them how to get them to talk to you how to get promote your stuff so let's start with number one how to pick the right influencer so there was a movie that came out a year ago or a year or two ago called air and the premise was simple Nike a shoe brand was
(07:57) struggling to enter the basketball Market at the time this is not drawn to scale the representation is that they weren't making that much money everybody else was making more fantastic and every year they would spend money on player sponsorships and they would get quote second tier rookies to wear their stuff there's the guy he's second tier he's wearing Nike and they kept losing the best players every year to Adidas and Converse yes Converse was actually a big player back then and so the exhausted partnership manager AKA talent scout
(08:29) insisted to Phil Knight that they go all in on this new Young rookie named Michael Jordan he was one of the top picks and they bet their entire basketball budget so they took what they were going to pay five to 10 players and just gave it to one and they did it in order to sign him and he got the biggest deal that anyone had ever signed because Nike needed him more than he needed them and they hoped they hoped that they would do $2 million in basketball shoe sales but instead they did 122 million in the first year and they created an iconic brand that has yet to be surpassed decades later and you can see
(09:11) how Nike now eats the entire pie all because they went all in on the right influencer they picked the right guy and so the question for you is who's your Michael Jordan and so there's two ways you can approach this one you have a branded product and you go find a super influencer to partner with so you have the thing and then you go to find the person or two you find the person and then you brand something around them either works so the Nike Air story was an example of number one Nike was selling basketball shoes people who wear basketball shoes tend to watch and idolize basketball players so finding the best available basketball player
(09:53) made the most sense for them in this case Michael Jordan so they kept their brand and then Jordan promoted a personal line that's how they married the two cuz he needed them less than they needed him but Nike overall was still a bigger brand than Michael Jordan was especially as a rookie an example of number two is some company that you probably haven't heard of which is Congo Congo is a drink manufacturer they have three massive Brands underneath of their umbrella and one of them is prime the other two also do half a billion dollar a year in sales
(10:25) and you've heard of those too but for the purpose of the presentation I'm just going to focus on Congo so Congo you've never heard of Logan Paul you probably have and so they decided to say we're going to go find the influencer and create the product that's branded for them and we're going to do the delivery and so the difference these two examples is Nike you get the pro the influencer to promote your brand or you deliver on theirs that's the difference between the two models both work and so which brand you use depends
(10:58) on who has the bigger audience cuz you're like wait how do I get which one well it just depends who's bigger so Nike had a bigger audience than Jordan so he promoted them now he was still up he was bigger in basketball than Nike and so they created a specific line around Jordan so that's kind of the Nuance of this and that's why understanding how this works is so important for you actually executing on it Logan Paul has a bigger audience than Congo more people have heard of him than Congo and so they delivered for him and so you can get an army of tiny
(11:27) influencers or find one super influence and the pro tip here is that the first if you want to find lots of little guys who are 100K each right it will take you longer but you'll be able to retain more ownership because you'll pretty much always be bigger than them and that's what I did in these companies so with Prestige labs and Allen both of those I had lots of lots of little Affiliates lots of little influencers the second is faster and easier to manage but you give up more now I will say personally that I lean
(11:57) far more towards this now as I understand branding and I understand speed to Market and I understand the value of aggressive growth and the insurance policy that a super influencer provides to a business which is exactly what we did with school I both co-own and act as my own influencer for the school games and school the platform itself and so you might be like okay well that's great for Nike and Prime and febles and school but what about me what about everyday business owners how do we actually get in contact with influencers and super
(12:31) influencers well first you have to know who buys the sort of stuff you sell the fancy term for this is ideal customer or Avatar or ICP then you got to figure out the influencers they follow then you got to pick out the super influencers from there that best fit your product and so I think about contacting people in layers so this is tactical all right so everyone take notes like this is the part where you take notes on it all right so first I start with influencers I know personally now you might be like well I don't know influencer believe it or not you probably do know someone personally they
(13:06) might not be Logan Paul but they probably have a bigger following than you I can almost guarantee that you know someone who has a bigger following than you that's why you know them and if you contact all of them or don't know any because I'm going to give all the people with excuses in the room they're like I don't want to talk to people I know okay fine so if you did contact all of them or you don't know any then you move on to the next Circle which is I ask my network who they know I say okay I don't know any big influencers do y'all know any big influencers and when I make this point I
(13:37) want to emphasize this actually ask you can even cut the person that you ask in on your side of the deal if they make an intro and it actually works out and you can pay real money for this because it's exceptionally valuable for you and your business for all the points I already made and so you just say something like do you know XXX person or do you know anyone who has that size audience or who caters to this type of people and if you want to add the optional I'm paying XXX for an intro now if they don't know anyone so this is for the people who have excuses
(14:08) in the room if they don't know anyone so you don't know anybody and your friends don't know anybody because you live in a rock fantastic then you move on to the next circle out which is influencers you follow or have heard of and what I do is I reach out everywhere multiple times and find Mutual connections and I harass the living hell out of them and offer bounties and crazy gifts and when I say harassing living hell I mean of my friends not the person all right to be very clear great way to not get a partnership done but reaching out on multiple channels super smart so if you
(14:39) follow them on Instagram also look at them on LinkedIn look at them on Tik Tok look at them via email look at Via Direct Mail people forget about this you can actually deliver stuff to people's address by the way you can't unsubscribe from Direct Mail fun fact all right so there are things that you can do to get people's attention and here's what's interesting somebody who has a very large following on Instagram might have a very small following on L LinkedIn and they might check both of their inboxes but where do you think you're more likely to stand out when they get one of 10 inbox messages on LinkedIn versus the
(15:12) one of 1,000 they get on Instagram right go everywhere because you might stick out and you can follow up to be clear I'm not saying don't follow up do that but I definitely want to take the people I know and ask them for it and now if none of them respond to you then you can go through formal channels and this is a little bit of a pro tip so one obviously some of these guys will have agents if you if you're looking for super influencers and I will say this having now dealt with super influencers it's not as much as you think most of the time most of the time
(15:44) it's not nearly as much as you think if you're a bigger business owner for those of you who get that otherwise you'd be like I have to spend $10 million to get this person honestly Superstars you can get for a couple hundred grand a year you'd be amazed now here's the little Pro tip for you most influencers of some sort have a website and most of them sell at least one thing and a little Pro tip for you is just actually go to their website as another place and opt in actually contact support actually Reach Out find the email address on the site and reach out you'll be amazed at again instead of
(16:20) going to the Thousand DM inbox on Instagram that there might only be six people who are actually emailing so just don't make the assumption that because lots of people see it lot lots of people take action so I'm going to tell you a quick analogy in this because I think this will drive it home we recently put out uh we did a we did a contest for editors because we have a big media team at MOS media and we had 1,200 people off of one post said that they were interested in the role now many people were probably like oh man I don't want to apply for something like that because I probably don't have
(16:49) a shot well wait for the second stat we then gave all of those 1,00 people who who wanted to be editors one raw file and we said just edit it and you've got 48 hours to send it in guess how many of the 1,200 the 1,200 people actually submitted an edit 60 60 5% one in 20 so the odds are still in your favor if you actually take action you would be and that's a pretty big number and it's the same thing going for jobs going for girls going for whatever you want you'd be amazed how low the bar is if you actually try and so that's how you pick them tactically all right so let's just recap
(17:35) this for number one find find this biggest person that you connect with using the circles if your audience is bigger than theirs then you ask them to promote your thing if Their audience is bigger than yours you offer to deliver for them finding your quote Michael Jordan can give you the benefit of years of building a massive audience without the time cost and you immediately reap the benefits of their work in exchange for a portion of the upside and so that's how you pick the right influencer number one so let's move on to step two you're like okay I've got my eyes on this guy I've
(18:06) got my eyes on my Michael Jordan now you got to get them to talk to you so no matter how good your thing is or the offer that you want to make them if they don't respond to you or you can't get a hold to them you're not going to get very far so here's how I get them interested verify yourself the magic message and the rule 100 three steps so let's walk through the first one so verifying yourself has two individual steps first you literally verify yourself on the platform if you can pay the $10 per month or whatever it is to get the blue check mark all right you do
(18:38) this because you will get five to 10 times the response rates and so if I think about my time as valuable if I can get if I can compress my time to 10x time for $10 a month I cannot imagine a better use of resources that means for 10 bucks you can get 5 to 10x the time back absolutely worth it step two of verif yourself is don't be like Rakesh 000018 don't be like him be like Jim Jim has a verification badge he has a description of what he does by the way if you want to partner with influencers to do stuff say so in the description say what you want them to see if you're like hey I'm reaching out to influencers
(19:19) and it just says like big music head and you're reaching out about e-commerce stuff probably not a good idea they're going to immediately read your social resume and be like this guy has nothing to do with what he's offering me if you want to be a professional act like a professional do it for money do it like it's your job because it is he's a profile picture now one thing that I would fix about Jims is I would make it more more of his face closer up and lighter lighter and brighter if you will I put mine there because of course you know magic social media man that I am um mind you I had to learn this the
(19:50) hard way my first version of this was like I was zoomed all the way out and you couldn't have seen it was super pixelated all right and so I've learned this stuff over time so you want to make sure you have a picture that makes you look like human being fantastic and then actually use the platform post a few things that show who you are on whatever platform you choose to so you can see he's got post obviously this guy's into music and his stuff's about music that makes sense by the way I don't know either of these people I just grabb them from my DMs I just saw who stood out and who were people had guarantee would
(20:16) never respond to all right so in short don't be a weirdo don't look like Rakesh be like Jim and to be fair Rakesh if you do watch this I don't think you're necessarily a weirdo you're displaying like one all right so number one verify yourself check so now if we have verified ourselves we got to figure out what we're actually going to say to them so let me give you the magic message so this is a sample message script you would send this to an influencer hey longtime fan firsttime messenger I own a company that partners with influencers to start communities this was one I made for school that they own based on your
(20:52) following it looks like you generate anywhere from X to Y per month in recurring income here are screenshots of people who started this month alone mind you the screenshots don't necessarily need to be from you they're just screenshots of other people who've had the same experience you get the majority of the profits we do a majority of the work would you be up for a 15-minute call for me to walk you through what something like this would look like that's it very straightforward now to be clear the more
(21:16) personalize the message the better you only need one person to say yes put the time in to actually look like you took a moment to think about this person don't just blast a hundred of these messages copy and paste I say long time longtime follower first-time messenger guess who some of the best people to start with are people you actually follow bonus points if they've already interacted with you before in the past and guess what if they don't respond congratulations you just got practice for free bonus points if it is your dream
(21:49) influencer offer to fly out to show them you're serious if you incur costs they will take you more seriously if you want to play with the pros you got to act like a now if you're listening to this you're watching this and you're like well I don't have the money to fly out that's fine but if you want to play in the big leagues you got to do what you got to do and they're not going to take you seriously because they want somebody who has some level of resources and success now you can fake it before you
(22:12) make it which I'm not really a fan of or you just say I'm going all in on this and you make the BET and you're going to strike out sometimes and that's okay because life is long and you only need one and so what you'd say something like this you'd say hey I'm out that way all the time so it's no big deal I'm happy to stop by so we can meet one another and see if there's an opportunity that makes sense the key part is like I'm out that way all the time because they also don't want to in inconvenience you but
(22:35) if you're like oh it's no problem I'm out there that way anyway because it also shows that you're busy you're doing other stuff you're they're not the only uh only only frog in the kettle I don't know if that's a saying I'm going with it okay fantastic and next little bonus tip is that if they have a public office spend time and money on an scen gift and a handwritten card and offer to pay a lot of money for them not you ahead of time for just 15 minutes and I'll be very clear about that last point the
(23:01) amount of people who are like hey I'll pay $100 for your time that might be a lot of money for you that might not be a lot of money for them and so you got to understand who you're playing with right if you if you're going up to kmen Electra shoot what's gen Z's equivalent of that uh Haley Bieber now she's married who's a hot girl Sydney Sweeney Sydney Sweeney great you're going to Sydney Sweeney and you're like hey babe we got out to dinner dinner's on me not a very compelling offer for SNY cuz they've got guys who will literally pay for all the food for the
(23:31) rest of her life and her travel and not just to get a picture of her underwear anyways the point is the point is calm down the point is is that you have to make it relevant to the influencer or the super influence that you're that you're going for it has to be something that they would actually value and the personalization I will say on a personal level that first one about making a big obscene gift it's more about the thought and the effort that someone can see that you incurred to put the gift together so I got an amazing gift the other day it's
(24:02) a it's a full SI don't copy this it's already been done all right so I got a full-size uh modern art piece that had uh the background of a of an Ace of Spades because we're we're in Vegas our headquarters in Vegas and it had this cool graffiti is paint all over it of the quotes that I had influenced the artist on and so it was all the quotes that he had had for me that had made an impact on his life and I got that and I was like this is so cool and it was clear and obvious that he spent a lot of time putting this together and it was
(24:33) relevant to me and so as a side note this is yet another Pro tip for you if you're going to give a gift to somebody and you're a business owner don't put your logo on it put theirs on it why would I wear someone else like it doesn't make any sense I want you to make something that I would want to wear all the time and then I will think of you every time I wear it then I create the positive Association okay bonus points over fantastic so you verify yourself you look like a legitimate person you send the magic message you offer to incur cost you try and send obscene gifts if you can if not you just
(25:05) offer to fly out if you can and at the very least you do a lot of work ahead of time which I'll get to in a second and you send the magic message great now since it's time to send it how many do we send you send a 100 messages per day split between as many platforms as needed 100 there's a rule of 100 it's consistent across Industries people talk about it I don't know why but I can't say that it works and so this will normally take about 4 hours per day so set a kitchen timer and send the messages you'd be amazed at how like if you just do this it will take you that
(25:40) long and just rip the Bandit off do it one day just do it one day and then you'll realize that you didn't die when someone doesn't respond and then you can do it a second day and then a third and then all of a sudden you'll start getting responses back I just had a DM recently from a lady who's like I read your book I did my first day of the rule of 100 and she was like I already got 10 responses she's like this is unbelievable and she spent years delaying her first message and I'm both happy for her and sad for her because imagine the
(26:09) potential you waste every day you don't do what you need to do in order to get where you want and then you keep repeating this until you get the replies bonus points and this is what I was referencing earlier if you've if you already follow this influencer and you've interact with them in some way you've commented on a story they they likeed something back then you already have an in you already have a history with that person even even tangential even tiny it still makes you look more real than Rakesh now I'll give you also a pro tip as being a quote super influencer if you want to call me that share your target
(26:42) influencer stories so this is what my DMs look like so this is what my my in the the outbox looks like or whatever so lots of stuff weirdo obviously porn blah blah blah now when I see mentioned you mentioned you in their story I I create content and so if someone created content for me because they mentioned me then it gives me the opportunity to put that on my story and if it's valuable then it provides value to my audience for no cost to me that's what a mentioned in a story is on top of the fact that they're spreading my message
(27:12) so it's actually like one of the easiest ways to quote give to a super influencer is just share what they have and also if I go into a DM inbox and I see that they've because you can see how many times someone has mentioned you or shared a story of yours and you see 15 shares I think oh shoot you know what I've incurred a bit of a debt with this person it's so nice of them to share this stuff they're making content for me they're they're spreading people to me I like them more at the onset day one day Zero so if you want to get their attention that's just a little Pro tip
(27:41) for you and a big reminder because I want to keep hitting this point is that you don't need a 100 influencers you just need one super influencer to take your company to the next level and transform your life so recap on section two on what you actually say to get them to respond number one be someone worth responding to verify yourself two look like a legit person on your profile three send the magic message or variations of that and personalize it personalize it personalize it offer to incur cost to meet them that's a little bit more advanced but it will work send 100 messages per day this takes time but you
(28:14) only need one and share the super influencer stories and posts you will gain more Affinity from them than if you do nothing at all so now that we have picked our influencer and we have optimized our messages and we're sending them we're going to start getting replies so here's how you close the deal here are the steps one over preparation equals profit two every position has an advantage three NOS or yeses so let's dive in so before you speak with them you want to prepare mockups of what their thing would look like on your product or the product that you want to
(28:50) make for them either way works remember you can take your Nike shoes and say we've got this idea for a line and we want to put it under you or I wi label drinks and I want to make a drink that's just for you Logan Paul or I want to make a tequila just for you the rock or I want to make a whiskey just for you Conor McGregor or I want to make Cosmetics just for you Kylie see where I'm going with this this is not new but people aren't seeing it this is why the opportunity exists so on top of the mock-ups you want to show graphs you want to be like this is you now this is you with me I
(29:19) say this simply but this is literally what you want to show someone you want to show some you actually did a little bit of math all right and you have some estimates and projections to go with that you want to say hey you've got this many followers if we post this post x times per week we assume y reach and we convert 1% of clicks which is standard based on these things that I've seen in the past within 12 months we should be able to get to here does that sound interesting if they say yes awesome you you're one step
(29:43) closer to closing the deal if they say no you find somebody else and you ask them why is it interesting because you know what they might give you some of the best feedback possible and so bottom line is that you want to show that you worked a lot on this and this is a key Point you'll see it as a recurring point when you're getting with the super influence I'll tell you why in a second the main reason you do that is because they want to work with a partner that's going to work hard for them and the best way to prove that
(30:08) you're going to do it later is to do it now is to do it first one of my favorite sayings is the best way to show an audience that you'll that you'll give them value after they buy is to give them value before they buy brilliant I know but guess what people don't do they're like I don't want to take I don't want to be taken advantage of my time is valuable no it's not and it's it's also relative you're coming to ask something from them don't mistake it like sure you're going to come be like they're going to benefit too but if you're going to a super influencer
(30:36) you're the one who stands to gain far more than them because they have themselves and they can make that partnership with anyone and you want them to pick you don't think about the time it takes you to make this great think about how much time you're going to save by them agreeing that you move years of work in the future rather than the fact that it takes you a day or two to prepare one presentation for 15 minutes so that you crush it and so for those you like but how do I structure the presentation this how you structure the presentation promise
(31:07) you tell them the good stuff that they're going to get from the partnership proof you tell them why they should believe you past experience or if you don't have that stats of people like them doing something comparable and if you have the product that you think that they should sell bring it and show it to them this is called a demo AKA a demonstration you want to show them that because if they do have a strong brand they're going to want want the thing to be good because they want to make sure that they're serving Their audience and so if you've got the bees needs of products let them taste the
(31:35) honey three plan tell them what the next steps look like what's expected of them and what you're going to do and by the way make your side look better than theirs so that they look like they're getting the best side of the deal and to be real they should be because they've already spent all these years leading up to this so you don't have to spend five years to build this audience they already did that and so they're going to just point which takes little effort but that's because they're leveraging the years of work they put in and then you're going to spend the rest of your time present forward making out for the
(32:06) fact that you didn't work the 5 to 10 years to build the brand and that's the deal and you might still have a smaller percentage of the overall pie and it's still worth it and so finally you've got the proof you got the promise you got the proof you got the plan and then you make the offer so then you make an offer so good they feel stupid saying no give them a Michael Jordan offer if they're bigger than you offer them more more if they're smaller still offer a lot and I'll give you a key little Pro tip on this help them grow if you want to go after a middle-sized influencer they may want
(32:38) growth more than they want money and so then offer them that instead or in addition so you can give on these variables it's like okay I can give you less in the economics but I'm going to invest all these resources I'm going to bring Five Guys I'm going to hire for you to help you 10 extra content so we both win because real talk if they are permanently associated with your brand if they get 10 times bigger guess who else gets 10 times bigger you worth it now I go through those four things and the thing that most of you guys are going to struggle with is proof so let's
(33:06) talk about that so this brings to the second point of this little mini part which is getting them to say yes every position has an advantage and a disadvantage I really want you to drill this in all right for example if you're brand new you sell the benefits of being brand new so for example I used to help agency owners with my company Allen which is a software for for agcy owners and some of them serve as gym owners which means they were direct competition of mine in my other company gym watch and so they'd say well hey
(33:36) it's easy for you to get gym owners you're the 800lb gorilla in the industry to which I would reply well one I wasn't always the 800lb gorilla I started at zero like everyone else but I promised a different set of benefits I said hey these companies don't care about you so if I was in your position I'd be like Alex doesn't care about you you're just number to him he he just wants to hit quota that's what his sales guys are doing right you're going to get assigned to some dozen care account rep who just clocks in every day that they train for
(34:06) a couple weeks just to get sped up and they're never going to cater to you but with me you're my only brand partner you have my full attention I don't want 100 Partners I just want one good one I can go all in on someone I can work day and night to help and grow and so you have my contact you have my cell phone you can come to my house I'll cook you dinner we'll be partners on this it would be impossible for them to give you the same attention as me now if you're thinking wow that's not a bad point well
(34:35) then I wonder what the advantage of being the 800lb gorilla is now if I'm the 800lb gorilla so once gym launch was the number one in the industry I would argue the opposite angle I would say well we have the best practices across a lot of accounts and I can feed them directly to you this kid doesn't have any other experience I can take the findings from thousands of accounts and feed them right to you we have the infrastructure and skill to just plug you right into this guy's got to hire all this I've got specialist across all
(34:59) these different things that can help you at a higher level and sure Sarah is only good at media buying but she's better at media buying than his generalist and we can help you scale on the business side because we already have we know what we're doing and you'll know that your audience is getting taken care of because we have support infrastructure let's say this thing does crush well guess what's going to happen to your little minnow he's going to get overwhelmed because he's never had this much attention before we know how to
(35:22) deal with it we've done it before and so the question is do you want to trust your brand as someone who's just getting into the industry or someone with a track record do you want to risk what you work so hard for on someone who might not even be here in 6 months we've been here almost a decade and we're going to keep being here so you're like wow okay every position has an advantage and a disadvantage and you sell based on the position you have in the marketplace so play to your advantages if you're new
(35:49) to the game and you're just getting into and this your first super influencer partnership then you're going to emphasize Personal Touch care flexibility going Allin the owner mentality of this is us being Partners we're in this together I'm going to do anything it takes to get to be successful now if you're this guy you're the 800lb gorilla then you're going to talk about track record the best practices the infrastructure The Specialist across functions brand Association they're going to get from associating with your brand where they don't get that with the minnow and once that happens whichever play you have
(36:19) they're going to say yes and if they don't then we go from our advantages and disadvantages to NOS or yeses which means we zoom out so let's talk about that if you don't have a track record the other reason to over prepare and make your presentations exceptional is that you can show them to other presentations that you make for other super influencers so if I try to pitch Kylie on cosmetics and I make this beautiful deck and I show all these graphs and all this explanations guess what I get to use I can take that when I go to Conor McGregor and I say this is some of the work that we prepared for
(36:50) other influencers I'm not saying work we did for them I'm just saying this is the type of stuff we do now when you see that what happens is people are like huh they're going to see who you're pitching and they're going to see the work that you do over and over again they're like wow this guy sustains a high level of professionalism and polish despite business he might not have won it's like and the subtext is imagine what he' do if we were actually working together and that's what you want them to think and so even if you didn't pitch them this is the extra Pro tip is that even if you
(37:19) didn't pitch Kylie or Connor or uh Ryan Reynolds you can show them alternative structures that you thought through and if you show three different versions for the three different influencers they might be like okay I saw you prepared me and that was okay but I really like what you did with Ryan Reynolds I like that version can we do something like that for me and so you give them more options to bait them in engaging with you and so all these things help you look more legitimate and increase the likelihood that you get one super
(37:50) influencer and if you get frustrated don't the gap between no and yes is where the opportunity to make life-changing money is and so we went out over a lot of stuff today and to bring this home I want to tell you guys two stories one from a new business owner using the super influencer process and the other from a very large established business owner because I want to cater to both people in the audience right now so I'll start with uh who both use the strategy for lifechanging wealth so let's start with a big business owner so some of you guys have heard of Tony
(38:19) Robbins in N graos they run a very large portfolio businesses and they recently reached out to a super influencer Matthew mccon and Matthew mccon plugged in their infrastructure they launched The Art of Living so it was a product that Matthew was the front face of and they did the delivery on the back end and they branded the product around what he wanted the art of living and they had the most people attend ever they had two plus million people registered for the that and almost half a million attend live and a million plus people see it
(38:47) unlike anything they'd ever had because they harnessed a single super influencer with a phenomenal brand and I point this out to show you a single partner can bring in life-changing income and so that's just an easy big business example all right those guys had the infrastructure they reached out I'm sure Tony Robins knowing all the the presidents and things like that he was probably one or two phone calls away from Matthew mccon and he said yes fine but let's talk about a small business example because I think for some of you guys here this may be the most relevant for you since a lesters may feel Out Of Reach for some
(39:20) of you and I want to be clear I don't think they're Out Of Reach for you I just think you may feel that way and so I want to at least meet you where you're at here's two UK guys Ms and fad and they added 44,000 per month in recurring Revenue without ads or a following neither of these guys has a following and they weren't even the face and that's key just like Congo with Logan Paul no one knows who Congo is no one who knows who Ms and fad are but when I show you who they partnered with you might have heard of them and so here's what they did they found an influencer Eddie ABW a former pro bodybuilder from
(39:54) the UK he only had 50,000 followers at the time and they reached out just like I said in the the the presentation earlier and then he replied doing the exact thing that I mentioned in the presentation earlier and then they told him that he'd be their only partner and the only client he had just like I said in the presentation earlier and theyd spent all of their time growing this brand which is exactly what they did to take him from 50k on because that's what he really cared about and he agreed and then they asked him if they'd want to start a paidon on
(40:24) community and they told him what would be expected of him and gave him projections proof promise plan here's the offer and then they made the proof promise plan into a presentation for him notice they focused on branding the product around him it wasn't the Ms and Fahad Community it's the abue crew about people were trying to get in shape get healthy again and he's older now so he's a slightly older demographic which I find actually as a side note very funny because makes a pot are 20y old guys all right Eddie Abus is in his 50s or 60s now and so then they
(40:56) launched the community and in the first 30 days two 20-y old guys with no following and no money got to 44,000 in monthly recurring Revenue in the United States at least that's a top 1% income and I want to be very clear it's not because like Ms and vad were able to take five years of work and compress it into one series of conversations because they were willing to give up the upside they were willing to get rejected by the other hundred people they reached out to that didn't say yes so they could get the one that
(41:26) did and so this worked because Eddie's audience wanted more high value access to him so mien vad made that happen very simple and so they benefited from his brand and he benefited from their operations and the work that he wasn't willing to do so when I talked to them they were like he uh he just just wants to make content he doesn't want to do anything else and so we just said we'll do everything else we'll bring the camera we'll do the recording we'll do the editing we'll even put the stories up they have the ctas with the links so that we drive people with the community and we'll manage the community itself and we'll send you a cut of the money
(41:57) and he said cool and so they both profited and so the point is if you actually just follow this process you can jump forward multiple levels of income quickly because you only need one super influencer to change your life just one and so for more tactics about this stuff because we're getting close on time I have free books and courses on Outreach using Affiliates also if you zoom into that little picture of mson fad you see a little book that they have in the background the only book they have referenced there it's book check it
(42:28) out um and you can watch this stuff on my site so I actually have the training for reaching out getting Affiliates more in-depth stuff more scripts all that stuff it's absolutely free on my site acquisition. comom trining it's all free all right um and if you don't have a product to recruit a super influencer with so the first ones if you already have a product and you and you want to just go straight to to getting them to promote it that's what that's for you and if you don't have a product then you
(42:51) can start like makes and vad by building a community for an influencer and the reason this is kind of like a one fits a one siiz fits all product for most influencers is that pretty much every influencer literally gets followed because people want access they want more exposure to them and so all you do is just have more exposure more content more access just behind a pay wall so that the highest fans get what they want and everybody else still get stuff for free so it's a win-win all right and so if you want that school.com games it's also free to start so if you're like I don't know what the product you can
(43:21) start one for free and you can go start approaching influencers to do it all right so I hope that I fulfilled my promise to you from the beginning in the three-step super influencer process which is one know how to pick them two know how to get them to talk to you and three how to get them to promote your stuff so you can create life-changing wealth and hopefully I gave you the tools to Leap Frog your income if you actually take action so there's all your free stuff thank you guys so much enjoy

(00:00) Over my career acquiring and scaling businesses foracquisition.com, I've done a lot of deals. I want to put the five most brutally effective tactics that I know in one video for you. A lot of these things I didn't actually learn from books. I learned them from mentors and actually seeing them do it and learning like in the streets in the real world.
(00:18) Most itty bitty tactics like don't actually drive the needle. But these five actually have gotten deals done and improve my situation or standing in the deal. So, let's dive in. There's three contexts that you're going to use each of these skills with. The first is with employees, and this goes both ways. If you're an employee trying to negotiate with an employer, then that applies.
(00:38) The second is going to be vendors. Now, this also applies if you're a vendor who's dealing with customers. And then third, you've got what I would consider partners. This is when you do deals, M&A, things like that, investment. So, these are kind of the three big vectors that all of this stuff applies to. So, if you're like, I'm not sure if this will work for me, you for sure, even if you don't have a business, you are an employee.
(00:57) And if you are an employee and you don't want to use that, you certainly have vendors that come to your house and do things for you. Like this is the fruit of life. You have to negotiate and you get what you negotiate, not what you deserve. That may sound not fair, but it's also the truth.
(01:12) Number one, this is actually from a Harvard Business School thing that I learned from Chiron Cervata. It's called BATNA. Now, I didn't know the fancy term for it, but it means best alternative to a negotiated agreement. So, what does this really mean? Research has shown that having strong BATNA, basically a strong alternative, gives you significant leverage in negotiations.
(01:34) Negotiations is all about leverage. London Business School did a study and they found that negotiators who know their alternatives set higher aspirations. So they ask for more. They make more aggressive first offers and they negotiate ultimately better outcomes. So your BATNA serves as almost like an anchor, a counter anchor that you have in the back of your mind of what you're negotiating with.
(01:51) It's kind of like a source of power. It's a decision standard that you only accept deals that are better than your best alternative. You can think about this in any setting. So, if you're with a girl and you know that you can only date tens. If a seven comes along, you're like, "Well, my alternative is a 10, so I'm only dealing with tens.
(02:06) " If someone says, "Hey, I'll be willing to buy all of your inventory for 10 bucks a piece." And somebody else comes along and says, "I'll do it for nine." Instead of just saying no, you're like, "I'll do it for$ 1050 or I'll do it for 11." You can edge them up. But if you know that it's not going to matter, then it doesn't matter.
(02:21) So, I'll tell you something that recently happened. I'm right now negotiating to buy a home. It's something that Ila wants and it's aggressive. We already have a home that we like a lot. I really like the house we have. My best alternative to buying this house is doing nothing and just enjoying the home that I already have.
(02:40) They're in a terrible position because right now I know that they haven't had anyone else who's bid on the property because it's aggressively priced. I'll put it that way. It's them versus me and it's who wants it less. The reason badness is so important, you're like, "Okay, I get that.
(02:54) How do I have a best alternative to a negotiated agreement?" You win negotiations, and I'm starting with this one because I think it it's all five of the or six ones that I'm going to show you are going to be so important, but this one is probably the greatest source of psychological power. And you do this before you sit down to the table.
(03:09) Me going to look at these homes, I know I don't have to buy the homes. When I was selling Gym Launch and Prestige Labs, I was like, I can just keep the businesses and they'll just keep making me money. I don't need to sell them. And from negotiating for that position, you only want to sell when you don't want to sell.
(03:23) You want to buy when you don't want to buy because you have something else. If you're looking for jobs as an employee, you want to negotiate when you already have another offer. So, if you're going to your existing employer, get another offer and then negotiate with that. You can only do that so many times before you start losing goodwill.
(03:37) So, you have to make sure that you're balancing that well. If you're dealing with a vendor, then you're like, "Okay, I'm going to get multiple bids before I'm going to decide to work with you because these are what I'm considering." You'll get so educated from actually negotiating four, five, six of these vendor agreements that you'll learn other terms that other people include that you can use, which is a later strategy that I'll explain.
(03:54) Getting multiple offers before you sit down increases your bet. So, for sure, don't take the first offer because even if you have first offer within the negotiation with one guy, but then you have that offer compared to all the other offers you're ultimately going to get to do the work. On the vendor side, it's reversed.
(04:09) What's my best alternative? What are my other customers? If I've got 20 other customers, I got people banging on the door. It's a supply demand thing. So, I've got more demand for my services than I have supply. And so, if you don't want it, don't worry. I've got another customer behind you. And so, this is the leverage that we go back and forth in negotiations.
(04:24) And then, finally, with partnerships, the same idea. How can I get multiple offers from people wanting to buy my business? And to the same degree for me, if I'm trying to buy a business, then I want to not have to buy the business because I got other businesses I'm looking at. So, no matter what, all of this is one before you sit down to the table.
(04:40) Right now, if you sit down and you need this deal and you have no other offers, all the little tactics that you can try, sure, you can try to do it, but the thing is that it's just trying to win at poker only on bluffing. It's a bad position to be in. I would rather have pocket aces. If you have other offers, there's two different ways of thinking about this.
(04:57) So, one is you can be overt about it and say, "Listen, this is the counter offer. If you can beat the offer, beat it. If you can't, no worries. We don't need to waste time." The other way is that you just have it in the back of your mind and then you just see what you can get. Because the thing is, somebody else is giving you a $10 offer.
(05:09) If you say, "Hey, I've got a $10 offer, maybe this person will just beat it by 1025." But if you have the confidence that you know you're going to sell the inventory no matter what for a profit, shoot for 11, shoot for 12, shoot for 15. Like you can shoot way higher because you know your plan B is not bad.
(05:23) And so when you show it, they're just going to basically marginally edge it versus you having the confidence to basically swing big. Real quick, if you're a business owner and you are not growing as fast as you'd like, I'd like to give you a free gift. So my team and I put together the $100 million scaling roadmap, which is basically 200 hours of us looking over all the portfolio companies we've had and what stages of growth they went through and more importantly where they got stuck and how they got past it.
(05:47) And so we broke it into these 10 stages and we made this little kind of quiz thing where if you put in your business information, it'll tell you where you're at and the most important part for you, what to do for each of functions of the business across product, marketing, sales, customer success, recruiting, IT, human resources, and finance.
(06:02) And so no matter what you're struggling with, someone else has already struggled with it and solved it. And so I'd like to give you this thing absolutely free. You can go to acquisition.com/roadmap, plug in your business information. And if you want us to actually help you deconstrain the business and you're trying to scale, we'd love to help you out on the thank you page.
(06:19) You can just book a call with my team and we will look at the business, see if we can help, and if we can, we'll invite you out to Vegas and we'll do this in person live. So if that's cool, hit the link. Otherwise, enjoy the rest of the video. Now, the second is a big one, and a lot of negotiation books and courses and stuff talk about this, and people are like, "Hey, I'm not trying to anchor here.
(06:36) " It doesn't matter if you say, "I'm not trying to anchor here." It's an anchor. An anchor is the first number that is set in a negotiation. If you're like, "Hey, what do you think you'd be willing to do this for?" And someone's like, "Ah, I was thinking I could maybe do it for $2,000." That's now the anchor.
(06:50) You want to get less than that, and you were like, "Shoot, I was hoping for 500." Well, something you should have said 500 first because now their 2,000s seem ridiculous. There is a strategy called counter anchoring, but it's typically not as effective as anchoring, but it's the only move you have left.
(07:02) Now, the flip side is the reason a lot of people don't want to put the anchor out is because they don't want to short change. If someone was going to say yes to 5,000, you put 2,000 out there, you're like, damn, because whatever happens is if someone gives you a fast yes, you're like, "No, I left so much money on the table.
(07:15) " So, I'll give you a little pro tip that I've learned being on the other side of this. If I have somebody who comes to me and says, "Hey, I'll do it for $2,000." And I would have paid five and I say, "Yeah, $2,000 works." The next thing I do is I say, "Hey, and if you were curious of whether I would do it for 2500, I wouldn't have done it.
(07:32) " And the thing is that it puts them at ease that like, you know what, you wouldn't have done more. And what happened is I bought a super expensive penthouse a few years ago. And after I bought it, the guy who sold it to me, obviously a wealthy guy, too. He said, "Hey, we accepted your first offer and you're probably wondering if we would have done it for less.
(07:48) " He said, "I wouldn't have sold it for a penny less." It felt so classy. Maybe he would have sold it for penny less. I have no idea. But in the moment it actually like I was like okay it just made me feel a lot better. So if you're in the reverse situation I would put someone at ease by just saying hey I wouldn't have done it for any less or I wouldn't have done it for anymore or whatever.
(08:04) What's interesting is that Daniel Nobel's prize winner figured out that people give excessive weight to the initial information and make insufficient adjustments from that starting point. It's a psychological bias. Basically it's like you want to anchor as high as possible. That's why I'm a big advocate of getting the gasp.
(08:19) put the big number out there because it completely shifts the whole negotiation numbers to way way higher and the things people think in different increments and that's what we want to change. If you say I'll do this work for $100,000, whatever you're in construction, if someone was thinking 10, their increments now become the entirety of what they were willing to pay.
(08:36) They're going to be like, can you do it for 80? All of a sudden, we're thinking in $20,000 increments. As a side note, you can also anchor increments. So, explain what that means. I'll actually walk you through the house negotiation that I'm actively in right now. The house was listed at 25 million. Then they dropped it to 20 million because the markets changed and things like that. Okay.
(08:52) So now they're at 20 million. So I made an offer for 15 million. They countered and said we'll do it for$69. So big move on their part, right? They're moving aggressively. They're trying to sell the house. They moved a lot towards me because they're trying to get a deal done. The natural thing that some people might think is okay, they're at 17, you're at 15.
(09:10) Counter with 16 here. So what I did is I countered with 15.25. So they moved three million, I moved up 250 grand. Thing is that there's this idea of like movement. If you make an offer, I make an offer. So if I say 15.25, what am I indicating? I'm not willing to move very much. I'm going to out of reciprocity, which we'll cover later. I'm willing to move a little bit.
(09:31) I'm going to make some counter offer, but I'm not going to give a lot. Then I can stack in other terms that make it more amarable for them. My initial offer, I had two other things. I was like, okay, I can offer cash. My first offer is not going to be cash. I can also say, hey, it has furnishings in the house which are super expensive.
(09:47) I don't want to have to deal with refernishing the house. What I did was when I moved up to 15.25, I sweetened the deal by making it all cash. But then I also said, I also want the $4 million of furniture that's in the house, which is technically a worse second offer than my first offer. But the thing is that I moved the number up and a lot of people are always way too fixated on the price and not enough on the terms.
(10:06) One is we anchor with our original price and also in the increments that we move in. And this was something that took me actually a while to figure out. And so let me tell you a story about this one. So, one of my partners at my gym way back in the day, I learned this from him. He had to get this big custom front desk built.
(10:18) So, it had like multiple cutouts. We had multiple sales people. Big impressive thing. You get a custom built. The guy came out, they built this whole thing. He was like, "Hey, when we went to do like the final inspection, we noticed that they had kind of like nicked a corner of it just from moving it around or whatever happened, right? It was a small nick, but it was noticeable.
(10:32) " My partner goes to the guy and he says, "Hey, how much would it cost you to replace this?" And the guy, of course, because he doesn't want to rebuild the whole thing. He's, "Oh my god, it would be a huge deal for us to have to like just this little thing. We'd have to go back to the shop. We have to do this stuff.
(10:47) It would probably cost us $1,500 just to replace that." And he says, "That sounds like a pretty good place to start it for a discount." Nasty. I was like, "Oh, I'm going to use that." If there's ever someone who messes something up, instead of saying, "Hey, what can you knock off the price?" Ask them what the big inconvenience would be for them, ascribe a price to it.
(11:05) And then they have a hard time backing down from that cuz they just said that's how much it would cost them to fix it. Then you should probably discount us by that much because that was the size of the mess up. So you get them bidding for themselves and then you flip it. So number three, I learned this from a different mentor.
(11:18) They call it misos, but basically multiple equivalent simultaneous offers. So what does that mean? That means that I present offer A, offer B, and offer C. Or just offer A and B. It doesn't really matter. You can have two offers. You can have three offers and each of these have different prices and terms associated with them.
(11:36) And so what happens is when you make multiple equivalent offers, it's like embedding reciprocity. It's like, hey, I'm trying to be reasonable. I just want to figure out what works best for you because all three of these work for me, but which one's better? This is a way of actually teasing out what someone else's priorities are if they're not willing to tell you because a lot of times you want to hold your card close and not say, "What are the things that are most valuable to you?" Now, over time, you build some trust, you build some
(11:55) rapport, and you will be able to share because ideally something that's important to you is not important to them. and they give you this one and something that's born to them, it's not born to you, you give to them. And that's fundamentally a good negotiation. And one of the big things that I misunderstood in the beginning is that I assumed negotiation was a zero- sum game.
(12:10) And it's never a zero- sum game because you're a different person. You have different needs. You're always going to have some things that will be more important to you than other people. And in that situation, it's like you want to just interlock the things that matter most to each person. That's where it becomes a positive sum game.
(12:20) Both parties are better off from basically giving and taking in places that are less meaningful to them and more meaningful to the other person. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology showed that presenting multiple equivalent offers simultaneously increases the likelihood of finding mutually beneficial solutions.
(12:36) This approach demonstrates flexibility while also maintaining your core interest because you're the one who's presenting all the offers. It's almost like a reverse assumed close. Hey, I'll do any of these three things and you just pick the one that works for you. And then the thing is they're picking all any of these I said already worked for me.
(12:52) Let me give you like a real world example. So let's say option A is lower monthly fee with a longer commitment. Option B is a higher monthly fee but has premium support. And then option C is kind of like a pay as you go with slightly higher rates but maximum flexibility. Right? So all three options will give you similar overall value but you might look at them and be like I just want to know which one meets your needs better.
(13:14) From their answers you'll be able to understand their motivations. Now let me tell you some knowledge from the street. If someone gives you multiple offers, if you're on the other side of the table, what I like to do is say, "I like the best part of this one, and I like the best part of this one, and I like the best part of this one.
(13:30) And why don't we make an offer that is the best of all three?" And I learned this from my friend Shiron. Guy's done more deals than anyone I know. I was like, "Oo, that's good." So, the flip side is you could ask someone, "Hey, can you give me two or three versions of what this deal might look like?" And then they come up with their versions of the deals.
(13:48) And then you say, "Great, I like this piece. How about we do option D?" And what's nice about this is it also shows some active listing for you. You countering with something like this or even taking two of the three components. Two of those components might be meaningful for you and not for them again because they put them in the different deals.
(14:02) You might find out that you can get more of the things that you want just by asking. So number four, reciprocity. Now reciprocity is key in all sorts of persuasion. And I'll say this one caveat that I believe reciprocity only matters in cultures where reciprocity matters. There are cultures where reciprocity is not nearly as important.
(14:20) This is where sometimes when cultures mix, people take advantage of systems because that's not as important in the culture they came from. And so the culture where the person is giving first in order because they expect something back, the other culture will just take advantage and be like, look at this idiot.
(14:35) He just gave me some free stuff. And so you have to make sure that basically you're within a culture or society that reciprocity is the norm. But if it is the norm, there's huge amounts of things that you can use from a persuasion perspective. So the beauty with how we structure reciprocity is that people are more sensitive to the fact that they gave something and you give something.
(14:54) What's more difficult is ascribing the relative value. So let me give you an extreme example. Let's say that I take someone's order from the counter and I bring it to the table where we're both eating lunch, right? The person might say, "Thank you for doing that." If I then said, "Hey, can you pick me up and drop me off from the airport tomorrow? I mean, I did get you your lunch yesterday.
(15:13) " The thing is that it poses, it looks like, it smells like reciprocity, but the value of those two concessions are wildly different. And so the idea is that we're trying to trade concessions in a way that is still advantageous to us. What I like to do in terms of my thinking, like the example that I gave in terms of multiple simultaneous offers, which is why I think this works well post that is that I try and break each of my things into as many different pieces as possible so I can trade more times.
(15:37) So, like this house example that I gave you earlier, if I have 15 million, but this thing is going to be financed. Can I go cash or financed? I can do closing period. I could say it's a 90-day close or a 30-day close. That's going to be significantly more valuable. I could say furniture versus not. There's other terms that we can basically weave into the deal that I'm not going to play all those cards at once.
(15:57) Now, this one is a real estate track. This is much more straightforward, but a transaction like this, it's like you want to think what are all the variables? We want to use all the value equation variables. Speed. How can I deliver this faster? How can I do it slower? We've got the actual price obviously.
(16:15) On top of that, we have the risk associated. So, who's going to be taking on more risk in this situation? And what are the different types of risk that someone's taking on? Then we have ease. How can we make this easier or harder for the other person? For each of these components, you want to take whatever you're offering, whether it's an employee or whether it's a vendor or whether it's a deal.
(16:32) I want to look through each of these lenses and think how can I have more variables at my disposal so that when it comes to the horse trading I can make a small concession in ease and they only have two variables and I've got five and when I have five I can give without changing my price and say hey I'll do 15 with ease they'll come down from 17 to 16 and I say cool I'll do 15 with ease and risk and then they come down from 16 to 15.
(17:00) 5 and I say cool I'll do 15 with ease, risk, and speed. And so when we do it like that, then all of a sudden it's like I'm still keeping the reciprocity, but I just have more arrows in my quiver. When you're sitting down at the table, you want to think through all of these different variables that you have at your disposal.
(17:17) For me, I have this big deal sheet that has 80 different things that I can change about a deal so that when I go into the conversation, I have so many things that I can move flexibly to make my offers more compelling without the unstated assumptions that people all have because the thing is they're assuming the deal just has these two things, then everything else is the way they want.
(17:38) And for you, you have 80 other variables that you're like, "Oh, I can change this one. I can change this one. I can change this one." And that allows you to stay in reciprocity with the other person that ultimately gets you a better deal long term. So as we're thinking through this, it's if we sit down at the table and we have one or multiple other offers that we think are really compelling and interesting and we use that as our psychological power so we can anchor super high and we anchor low in terms of our counters, right? Anchor high in terms of our initial,
(18:03) anchor low in terms of our counter offers and then we have multiple simultaneous offers that are either presented to us or that we can present to somebody else using more variables. and then horse trade with reciprocity so we can stay in the pocket but still more or less stay the same initial offer then we're probably going to increase the likelihood that we get a good deal done number five is framing I would say this is most important especially for employees and vendors less so for partnership type or like M&A type stuff
(18:28) but it can probably also be important here too but I'll just give more use cases in these two right now so if we're talking about framing then how we position something is going to matter a lot so if I'm an employee selling to an employer, which is fundamentally what we're doing. I would probably say something to the extent of we want to make investments in these places and I see me coming in as an investment, not a cost.
(18:51) And ideally, if we frame this as how am I going to get a return on this investment, then I'm no longer a cost center in the business at all because I'm just a percentage commission essentially on what I'm bringing in the business. If I'm a vendor, to the same degree, I'm going to try and frame something as an investment. I'm going to frame it based on return, not based on overhead.
(19:09) On the flip side, you always want to reframe the other way, which is you want to reframe this as cost. You want to reframe this as overhead, so that ultimately you have more basically negotiating power because you're pushing them down. They're anchoring themselves up. A lot of times people don't even understand framing.
(19:21) And so they'll just accept the frame that you present. So rather than saying, "Hey, this is going to cost you five grand," we can say like for $5,000 investment, you can see $15,000 in maintenance cost savings. That's very different than this is going to cost five grand. If that's the reality, then it's going to be far more compelling and far more likely person's going to accept your offer.
(19:37) even though functionally it's the exact same thing. I was talking to a few home services businesses that do like kind of construction stuff. And so I talked to a pool guy, talked to a patio guy, I talked to an awnings guy who did like awnings on top of patios and I said, um, do you have any data that shows resale value of homes that have awnings versus not? Or do you have any data on resale value of the specific neighborhoods that you're going to go into of pool versus not pool? If someone knows they spent $100,000 on a pool and adds $100,000 to
(20:03) their house, I'm like, then the pool's free. Except you get to enjoy the pool the whole time. So this we shouldn't even be talking about that because you're really just taking it from one pocket and putting to another. You're the one who gets to keep the pool. I don't keep the pool. It's all for you. So the idea here is how we frame it.
(20:17) If you're going into these things that cost you 100 grand, that's a very different frame than your house is currently worth a million. The other houses that are selling at 1.2 all have pools. It's going to cost you a h 100red grand for the pool, but you're going to add $200,000 in home value. what are we talking about? It's a very different conversation.
(20:31) So, tactically, when you're in one of these situations, we want to have the data to support our argument for whatever our framing is. And typically, it's going to be some sort of return, especially if it's a monetary thing, right? We want to frame it in terms of what the is. And so, the strongest position is look at the other 10 houses that sold in this neighborhood or look at however many deals that have been done.
(20:48) They all had these components. The ones that didn't suffer this sort of loss. And you know what? Maybe it's not a 1:1 ratio. It cost you 100 grand and the houses with pools, it's an extra $50,000. Okay, let's not frame it as 100. We can frame it as half off. But you also get to enjoy the pool for that whole time.
(21:04) And so if you think you're going to sell this in however many years, you want to enjoy it and barely pay much at all over that period of time. Probably rock and roll. If you like this video, you're going to love the 13 years of brutal business lessons that I have learned over my career. And dry.

Transcript:
(00:00) you have to spend an hour arm wrestling a client to sell a 1 000 package whereas here people buy 40 000 packages over the phone in less than 15 minutes so when i was 28 years old i was five or six years into business or my business career and i had just gone through a five-day gauntlet so i had done a two-day client event which was we had six or seven hundred clients uh that had come to our highest level program in person and then the next day i had my executive meeting then two days after that i did a meeting uh
(00:34) with all 135 of our employees who flew out uh to austin to to to do a two-day conference with us do some trainings all that kind of stuff my dad calls me up after this kind of five day marathon and he says hey alexander because that's what he calls me right he says hey alexander but he sounded really way more concerned and i was like what's going on um and so i roll out of bed put a hoodie on walking in the hallway so i didn't want you know wake layla and he says i thought you said this was just going to be a meeting of your highest level
(01:03) uh clients and i was like it was he was like didn't those people pay like 42 000 a year the highest level people and i was like yeah he's like but i thought but you just said you had like 700 people there and i was like yeah i know and i was like what's the issue he was like you had 700 people who paid that much money and i was like yeah what kind of came next was something that i think probably stung a little bit at the time but i knew that it wasn't coming from a place of where i didn't think it was coming from
(01:32) a place of of meanness and he says do they know that they're paying you that much i was like yeah they're aware it's not like i'm magically siphoning money out of their bank accounts he's like well i mean i hope i hope what you're giving them is worth it that could have really stung and it probably did um but i think i was kind of in such an emotionally exhausted state because if you've done five days of just pure events of it i was like i had no adrenals to get angry with and so i said well let me walk you through it so i said if
(02:04) i made you 239 000 would you pay me forty two thousand dollars he's like well how long would it take me and i was like it would take you know eleven months he was like okay well do i know i'm gonna make that money and i was like yeah you're pretty sure you're gonna make the money it was like okay he's like what would i have to do i was like you would you know wouldn't have to do a ton you'd have to probably do about 15 hours a week of work he was like okay um and would i have to pay that all up front or like how would i have to pay you i was
(02:38) like you would pay me as you made the money he was like huh well then yeah i would do it and i was like and that's why they do too and so when i walked my father through that kind of mental explanation partially part of it was to make sure that my father you know felt like i was legit but the other part of it his questions actually uh denote what the components of value are and so the purpose of this video is to walk you through the value equation which i think you know might be one of the bigger contributions that i'll have into the
(03:09) the marketing world and there are four components to value that's why i have my little handy-dandy ipad here so we can do this all visually alright so we'll say value and we have the four components of course of value to do when i was creating this it was because i wanted to figure out what this word meant i think value is one of the hardest things that we have as entrepreneurs to understand we just say it it's it's used loosely lifetime value you know provide more value excessive value blah blah blah right but we don't
(03:36) know what it actually means and if you ask someone what is value right how do you just how do you describe value how do you how do you measure or quantify value i think this is my one of my better things and so this is the value equation as alex for mostly defines it okay so there are four components to this the first component is what i consider the dream outcome all right and when i was thinking about this it all started because i was really trying to figure out why some people would buy some things and not other things
(04:06) and at the at the very beginning of this it was if i were selling to men in general more men value making money then losing weight right and so in general the category of things that make people money cost more for men than the category of things of losing weight and that's because the dream outcome of making money at least for men increases status more than losing weight does and so as a result that is deemed more valuable and so while i'll go through each of these components i'm going to give you two kind of examples
(04:36) of one that exemplifies it and doesn't exemplify it so that you can see it kind of in the real world the first component is is the thing that we are selling valuable in terms of is the dream outcome that we're going to deliver to the prospect something that they would like the reason this is probably the first one is because it kind of defines the category now within a category the remaining three variables are the things that will determine what is expensive and what is not and to go back to the the weight loss scenario if i
(05:03) have uh a woman for example who wants to lose weight and i sell there's probably some things that help people lose weight that are five dollars and some things that help you lose weight that are fifty thousand dollars so you've got a five dollar ebook and you've got liposuction all right so why is one five dollars and 150 000 when the dream outcome is the same of losing weight that's where the other three variables of value come into play value number two and obviously the goal here is to increase the dream
(05:26) outcome the more the more appealing we can make it seem the more viscerally we can describe what the dream outcome is going to be like when the when the prospect experiences it then they're going to deem it more valuable and then by extension be willing to pay us more for it the second component of value is perceived likelihood of achievement and believe it or not this was actually the last of the four because i was still trying to figure it out because i felt like something was missing and so this is the easiest example that i can give
(05:53) you mentally for two things where one is more valuable than the other based on the perceived likelihood of achievement and so for example if you were going to get now we'll use liposuction as an example if you're gonna get surgery right from a from a from a doctor and one doctor this is their first surgery coming out of medical school and the other doctor it's their 10 000th surgery of this specific type of surgery which guy would you be willing to pay more for well obviously the 10 000 surgery guy right i mean if anything you probably
(06:19) have the the first time surgery guy you'd want to do it for free or have him pay you right and so and what's funny about this just as an added tangent is that the guy who it's their first time would probably end up taking longer so you're actually getting less time with the guy who's done it 10 000 times than the guy who's done it once or never right and so even though you're actually getting less time you're willing to pay more for it which is just another interesting thing which is why value is not uh time in terms of how
(06:44) long it takes you to fulfill something should never be in the value equation for yourself all right so first is dream outcome is the thing that we're that we're going to sell this the experience that they're going to have would they imagine themselves experiencing going to be allowed to them second is how likely do they perceive the achievement of that dream outcome if i buy something right like that ebook example if i'm buying an e-book versus liposuction the likelihood that i think that i'm actually going to
(07:09) get the stomach that i want is probably significantly lower with an e-book than with liposuction right so the perceived likelihood of achievement is lower and by extension i will now get less value i will perceive less value and be willing to pay less for it and so for us as business owners and promoters for our businesses the goal is that in this equation and the reasons a fraction is that we want to increase both of these things right we want to increase the perceived likelihood of achievement and when you increase the dream outcome this
(07:36) is why a lot of marketers start promising bigger and bigger things i also believe that it's the most amateur it's the most beginner but it's where everyone starts alright this is where i started my career where all i would do is dream is is do bigger and bigger dream outcomes i promise more and more and the perceived likelihood of achievement what i did is i put more and more testimonials so the more testimonials i had the higher the certainty that the person or the prospect would experience what i was selling they believed me that if i had a
(08:01) thousand testimonials versus one you believe the person is better at the thing right and if they're better at the thing you're more certain which actually decreases risk which becomes more valuable third so this is the bottom side of the equation right so the top side of the equation we're trying to increase the bottom side of the equation we're trying to decrease all right so this is time delay so the time delay is the time between when i pay and what i get what i want i have this kind of in two separate pieces here well
(08:27) i'll just i'll just talk about the main one and then i'll talk about the about the fourth one we'll hit it all right so time delay and this is probably one of if not the most powerful things like if you want to enter into a marketplace you can do whatever the best guy is doing and do it in half the time and you will become more valuable right people will pay for speed all right and if you ever compete against somebody who's free or giving away free stuff sometimes you compete against government services i've
(08:50) got a friend of mine who does dmv expedited services in new mexico all right and they have 14 locations of basically expedited dmv services so you can renew your license and all that kind of stuff and they cost 50 bucks instead of being free from the government and they murder it murder it even though they're competing at something that's free they beat them on speed and so if you ever are competing against uh free compete with speed right fast speeds free okay so time delay can i do the thing faster can i get them there faster
(09:20) now the longer it takes the less valuable my service or product is right the shorter it takes the more valuable it is so in theory if i were to click buy on a digital product for a six pack and then look at my abs and i have a six pack that would be an infinitely valuable product right and so if we can think about our services as like how quickly right can i make this happen in reality a different example would be um if i were selling marketing services right to a physician and as soon as their card ran their phone rang right on the front
(09:50) desk with somebody saying hey i just heard about your thing i'm qualified i'd like to buy your services that would be unbelievably valuable right immeasurably valuable because of the speed right and so you can in a very real way increase the value of what you sell without changing the thing but only delivering the outcome faster that's the third component of value so the idea here is that we want to decrease the time delay right we want to make it faster for the prospect to experience the outcome that we are promising
(10:17) fourth component of value all right and there's two components to this i'm going to give you some nuances here it's effort and sacrifice so effort is what someone must do that they don't want to do in order to achieve the outcome sacrifice is what they have to give up or stop doing that they do enjoy doing in order to achieve the outcome so i'll give you an example of both all right so it's kind of like 4 4a and 4b right but i think they're kind of i bulk them in the same thing because i think they are similar enough that they're worth uh
(10:47) putting in the same bucket so effort for example would be like if i wanted to lose weight right then uh if i'm you know cindy lou all of a sudden i'm not doing certain things i might not be weighing my food i might not be counting my calories i might not be eating you know shopping at the healthy grocery store i might not be working out in the morning i might not be waking up right early in order to get the gym i might not have an extra hour or two every day that i have to dedicate to this i might not be sore right these are
(11:16) all things that i now have to experience that i don't want to experience that are part of effort right these are things that make this less valuable on the flip side if i were to uh sacrifice i'm sacrificing the foods i love i'm sacrificing sleeping in i'm sacrificing walking down the stairs without being in pain and so i think effort and sacrifice oftentimes are flip kind of both sides of the coin right they're either they're heads and tails of the same concept which is why but i think if you can think of that in terms of your
(11:43) own services like what am i making someone give up and what am i making someone start doing that they weren't doing before that they don't want to do right and so again the goal here is how can i decrease the effort and sacrifice associated with achieving the outcome when they buy from me the example would be if i had the the abs thing right now let's say it was instant but it was like incredibly painful right well you clicked the button then you get the abs but it was just like it felt like fire all over your body that would be a lot
(12:09) of effort from sac i mean that's painful right that's literally painful versus nothing at all well in each of those examples the one that isn't painful is going to be more valuable right and so as i think through product lines service lines i always attack it from this perspective all right is how can i create more value by increasing the dream outcome and my expression of it so that they believe what i'm saying and the way i have depicted what they want to be actually what they want and you would be surprised how many times people
(12:38) get this wrong right i was talking to um dr john berardi is the co-founder of precision nutrition they sold for a a nine figure plus exit he was talking about one of the biggest breakthroughs they had in their business when they understood the job to be done all right so they sold search certifications right he said most people think that selling certification is about selling continued education he was like that's not the dream outcome people are not actually wanting to buy the certification the dream outcome of the certification and
(13:07) the experience around that is actually being in a community and being meshed with other people who are just like you weird just like you and so as soon as they realized that that was actually the job to be done and people just wanted a socially acceptable excuse to go do that right certification is socially acceptable excuse to do that then in that instance now they had to find the dream outcome properly as to what people actually wanted right and so that was a huge breakthrough in their business and then business well up and all that kind
(13:32) of stuff and so getting the dream outcome right may seem simple but a lot of times being able to depict it accurately back to the prospect as they desire it um is extremely valuable so the goal is to increase the top side and decrease the bottom side and one of the things that and the reason this is a fraction and not an addition and then subtraction equation is that if you can get these bottom things down to zero right getting the bottom to zero you have an infinitely valuable product so no matter what your promise is on the
(13:56) top even it's tiny a tiny inconvenience you help people avoid if it's immediate and it requires no effort on their part you have an infinitely valuable product and when i look at the biggest businesses when i look at my own businesses and how i've changed as an entrepreneur over time i used to focus only on the top side and now when i look at the amazons i look at the netflix i look at uber all of that stuff is stuff that decreased the downside uber made it immediate and you now you now if you've seen on lyft you can be uh you can get
(14:22) first in line right so it's like boom you can hit it for an extra five dollars you can get picked up an extra like in a minute right it's crazy but they were smart about it they realized they could increase the value by decreasing the time delay netflix made decreased all the effort and sacrifice that went along with watching television and seeing uh and running movies and all that stuff it was immediate for them right there's no effort no sacrifice it's all right there you don't have any picking it's just boom they're like make suggestions etc
(14:46) this theme amazon right you buy it and then they've got drones delivering it to you in two hours right they consistently the biggest companies decrease the downside of the equation which is where more of the work happens but in my opinion it's also where the biggest moat lies from a competitive advantage standpoint and so this as i look at my companies this is what i'm focusing on with our products and our services how can we decrease the time delay how can we how can we decrease the effort and sacrifice that are associated with
(15:10) achieving the outcome that we want and then in so doing increase the perceived likelihood of achievement of the pro of the prospect so what i want to do is give you one side-by-side example of this concept so you've got personal training and you've got uh lipo all right so you've got both kind of versions of the same dream outcome all right so both stream outcomes are you're gonna look good you're gonna feel good all that kind of stuff right so i would say this is a is a one out of one um if we were to rate this on a binary scale
(15:36) of does it achieve the dream outcome yes personal training will help you look good feel good etc liposuction help you look good feel good etc all right now look at let's look at the second second thing here right perceive likelihood of achievement if you're buying personal training the perceived likelihood of achievement probably kind of low right because you're like am i really going to do this am i really going to follow the nutrition plan am i really going to wake up you know am i going to do all this stuff do i really think it's going to
(15:58) happen for me probably put a zero most people don't actually think they're going to be successful when they buy the thing now on the contrary liposuction do you think that you're going to have less fat on your stomach when you buy section the answer is yes you do think that you're going to have less so the perceived likelihood that you're going to do it very high which is a one let's go to number three so time delay all right so personal training am i going to have it immediately no personal training might take 12 months or 18 months or 24
(16:21) months before i get to my ideal weight and even then i still might not be my body might not the way i want it to look or my stomach might have extra skin all that kind of stuff right so it's going to take a long time for me to get to where i want to get to right it's not going to happen soon boom we've got another another zero here now liposuction if they just suck all the stuff out of my stomach and they cut the skin off right and it's nice and tight right what's the like what's the the time delay on that i don't know maybe a month maybe two
(16:46) months right before before it's it's all ready and sucked in right so it's a short and much shorter time time delay for the dream outcome to occur and then finally effort and sacrifice for personal training all the things i gave earlier right i gotta give i gotta i gotta go i gotta change the way i shop i gotta change the way i eat i gotta wake up early i gotta be sore three days a week right i might not be able to eat with my kids like there's all these other pains that go with i gotta learn how to cook healthy all these things
(17:11) right lipo i don't change anything right the effort and sacrifices i i fall asleep and instantly i'm woking back up from my medical coma i am sore in my stomach for sure you know for three or four weeks but then after that it's done right whereas here on this personal training side right i'm going to be sort of for for years right now my goal here is not to debate whether uh you know i think people should do fitness or do liposuction i'm obviously just do whatever you want right but for the for the for the context of us as business
(17:39) owners to understand the difference in value this is a one out of four and this is a four out of four which is why you have to spend an hour arm wrestling a client to sell a 1 000 package whereas here people buy 40 000 packages over the phone in less than 15 minutes and that is the difference of value and that is why the value equation is how i think that i this is how i see business this has taken me a long time to figure out and so i wanted to share it with you guys so anyways lots of love keeping amazing and if this was interesting for
(18:09) you fyi my book just released um it's 99 cents you can get it i made it 99 cents and the goal of all the things that i have here is um you know we're trying to build a portfolio of companies that does a billion dollars in revenue we're currently at about 85 million i know there are a lot of broke people in the world and uh my point here is to make sure that you are not one of them and to equip entrepreneurs with the stuff that they need to succeed without having to buy any courses on the internet so uh keeping awesome lots of
(18:35) love and see you in the next vid bye

14 Years of Marketing Advice in 35 Minutes - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDR-R--4HhM

Transcript:
(00:00) I've been in business for 14 years. We spend  tens of millions of dollars per year in paid   advertising, and in this video I'm going to share  something I've never shared before - which is that I have 12 internal hacks that we use  whenever we write any piece of advertising or copy that goes out to sell stuff. And I'm going to give you all of them.
(00:22) So let's start with number one - Headlines  Come First for a reason and the reason I have it as the first one is that it is the first  and most important so to quote David Oggovy   uh once you've written your headline you spent  80 cents of your advertising dollar right and so that means that the vast majority of people will  only see the headlines in whatever it is that you make and it almost feels unfair that a headline  is just a phrase or one word or one question but it is also the thing that is ultimately going to  get the most people to or have the biggest lever on whether your advertisements do well so think  about it like this because it's the law of small   numbers which is if you go from let's say a 1%  click-through rate to a 3% click-through rate you
(00:59) triple the amount of of people who are ultimately  going to see everything else that you have and   so there's very little things that happen in the  rest of the entire funnel that have the ability to triple sometimes you get 20% lift 50% lifts that'd  be a monster split test but a banger or killer headline can absolutely outperform the control  by two three sometimes 5x right that is why it's so important and it feels unfair because it's so  short but the thing is is the best advertisers the more they've been doing it the more they obsess  on the hook they obsess on the headline because
(01:31) they know that's where the money's at right like  if you have a winning hook for your ad campaigns you keep using it to death and you try and beat  it and so here's the here's some of the things   that I write down which is curiosity is king  different is ideal and sexy works and never run an ad without a headline because the thing is is  all ads have headlines there's just bad ones and   good ones because if you don't write a headline  you do have a headline it's just not very good and so fundamentally the headlines serve to give  us a different wrapping paper for the same offers
(02:01) and you want this headline to be so powerful and I  like this visual it grabs the reader by the throat right and so bonus points is how can I know that  something's going to work ahead of time one of the   best ways to test headlines and hooks is to look  at your organic content or other people's organic content or other people's ads look at the first 3  seconds visually and verbally what are they saying and what's happening in the background and those  are the first places that I'm going to look in   order to model what headlines apply to me now  the the really sexy hack around this is can I
(02:33) take can I steal like an artist from a different  industry can I look at ads that are working well   in the travel space and use them in business  can I look at ads in the weight loss space and use them in business or whatever space you're  in and so some thoughts I have are curiosity quotes questions are there kind of emotional  outcomes or experiences that I'm describing   one of my favorite headlines of all time is how  to yay without boo if you biggest insecurity right i'll say that again how to yay good thing  without boo bad thing even if you biggest fear
(03:03) how to speak confidently in front of strangers  without ever practicing even if you're deathly   afraid of speaking in public fyi there are entire  books written on each of these 12 pieces that I'm going to talk about i'm trying to give you the  8020 because at the end of the day when you're   writing ads you're not going to read 12 books  before you write the ad you're going to have a little mental checklist that you go over and  that's the checklist I'm giving you yeah and   so each of these bullets are kind of like the  best like best converting nuggets that I have
(03:26) on each of these kind of mini topics and so this  is like my little cheat sheet so whenever I get   stuck or I need a new idea or for a new image or a  video or copy this is what I use to kind of remind myself number two say what only you can say so if  you've done something remarkable or different you want to say it proof will always outdo promise so  the reason at the very beginning of this video I said we spent tens of millions of dollars on  ads last year between our portfolio companies   so this isn't like we don't have an agency that's  actually us spending money in our actual companies
(03:58) um so it's not like me taking credit for all the  clients that I have uh like it's not that it's   like these are companies that I own that we spent  money on to generate revenue right so we risk real money behind these things now if you're the only  triple black belt in your local area say so if you're the only person who's helped moms over 35  who are vegan powerlifters say so if you're the only person who like the thing is is that what you  want to do is you want to be one of a kind but the beauty is that you get to control what the pond  that you're one of a kind is and so the friendly
(04:32) reminder here is that competitors can copy your  offer but they cannot copy your proof that has to be earned and so one of the big reasons the big  defenses that I believe exists for people who have   done stuff which is why you should do stuff is  that it doesn't matter how many AI avatars come out the AI avatar can never have done something  in the real world they can lie but they can never have done something and so no one can take your  story or your experiences away from you and this   is one of the things that excites me about the  future of AI is that story is still going to
(05:02) be paramount why should I listen to you is still  going to be a question at the top of everyone's mind and in a world where trust is going to get  diminished very rapidly where we're not going to   know what's real and what isn't verification of  facts is going to be even more important so say what only you can say number three always call  out who you're looking for and bonus points who you're not looking for which is actually even more  powerful than the original call out so because it's one thing to say hey you know I'm looking  for business owners but if you say hey if you're   below $250,000 a year you're below $500,000 you're  below a million dollar a year hey this isn't for
(05:38) you go consume my free content it it communicates  very strongly where you position yourself in the marketplace and so if you only want to help people  who want to lose a lot of weight not a little bit   of weight like there's a big advantage you know  what's funny i've actually never seen anyone in weight loss do this but just say like "Hey only  for people who are trying to look o lose over 30   lbs.
(06:00) " Here's the crazy part there's enough people  who are trying to lose over 30 lbs that you can say no to the people who have less than 30 lbs to  lose here's the other great thing about people who   have over 30 lbs to lose is that you might only  need a couple hundred customers in order to make your business work and there's like a billion  people many billions but maybe only a billion   that speak your language doesn't matter point  is is that most people are afraid of saying no to customers but when you say no to customers you  polarize the customers who are the right customer   to move even more towards you what you don't want  to be is vanilla if you say "I'm everything to all
(06:26) people i accept all customers." Then it means no  one feels pulled to your marketing because they're   never going to think "Oh this is for me." That  is the result that we want to have happen from our advertising that someone self- selects they  raise their hand and be like "Wow I feel like this   person's talking to me.
(06:44) " And so when you advertise  you never advertise to the masses you advertise to one person and so you want to be very clear when  you're writing your copy who is that one person i want to identify the reader i want to identify  the viewer or the listener right and you want them   to think how does he know my secrets well you can  only be that specific if you're talking about one person and so as you go through this you can go  through different levels of awareness which is   like at the top level someone can be completely  unaware so you have to hook them with curiosity at a level underneath of that you have to have  someone who might be problem aware hey do you get   up at night to pee more than two times hey have  you ever had someone cancel a contract before it
(07:13) comes due right these are problem aware then you  have solution aware which is like have you ever   tried to collect using some of these softwares and  it hasn't worked the way it was supposed to have you ever tried a supplement and it hasn't gotten  the results that you want that's solution aware   right underneath of that you have product aware  okay have you ever tried this type of creatine versus this type have you ever tried an ad agency  before that's done meta ads right these are very very more aware customers and finally the most  aware customers are people who already know about   you and about your product and then you have to  make offers to those people but at all all the
(07:43) way through the stack we want to talk to people as  though we know who they are because you probably do and the crazy thing is that customers this is  the crazy part about customers we all you want   to lean into the fact that everyone is selfish  everyone thinks they're the center of their own universe and when you can say something that  actually affects many many people but you can   say it as though they think that they're alone  in the universe when you are specific that is what creates compelling copy specificity  and so if I say "Hey are you overweight?"
(08:11) That's that's trit marketing you don't want to  use terms like marketing ease like like like um marketing speak marketing lingo right you've read  ad copy before and been like "Oh this is ad copy." The way that you get out of that is by taking  words that people use and breaking them down into   chunks and so by saying "Hey uh instead of saying  are you overweight?" It's do you have trouble getting upstairs or going on a a walk for a long  period of time without a rash forming between your legs and sweating in places you didn't know you  could when you say that that's much more specific
(08:44) and so what we want to think about is what are the  moments that someone's going to experience fatness   what are the moments someone's going to experience  brokenness what are the moments someone's going to experience frustration in their marriage or their  friendship or loneliness like we talk about the   moments because the moments is what they remember  no one remembers the vague words and that's not what gets them to emote or have an emotion and  then ultimately lowers the actions threshold   so they take the next step and so for example I  just had a a cash episode with a gentleman who
(09:11) does bar consulting so he helps bars become more  profitable uh like restaurant bars and so when I looked at the copy it looked generic it looked  like he was just using marketing lingo rather   than saying "Hey when you look behind the bar does  it look like a bomb went off?" Right does it look like this is a homeless shelter behind your bar  right the thing is is that you're probably going   to laugh but the person's probably like "Yeah my  bar looks like that it's a mess.
(09:31) " Right and the thing is is that that's a moment when they walk  in or they look behind the counter and they're   like "What happened?" That's the moment we want to  pinpoint because they probably had that happen the last seven days and if that pain is is fresh  the likelihood that they then take that next action is high so the next one is number four  always have a reason why and this is big so I like to use the uh the fraternity party planner  uh perspective which is that it doesn't actually   matter what reason you use but more so that you  have a reason to begin with and so this uh the
(10:02) first point when I started adding this in was um  I think I read one of Keini's things ages ago uh where we talked about how when people were cutting  other people in line if they had a good reason   people were more likely to let them cut in which  is basically a persuasion win they said "Hey can I get in line in front of you?" And he's like "Hey  I've got this paper I've got to turn in i need to   copy it quickly and so people said yes but later  they tested it where they just said "Hey I have to get in line because my cat is back home." It  has nothing to do with getting in line or needing   urgency around the copy they just basically said  because insert random reason but having a reason
(10:34) in general for most people makes it better than  no reason at all and so the word because is one of the most influential words in the English  language use it because it works and so if you   are going to use a reason great now you get bonus  points for a reason if you can tie it back to urgency or scarcity in some way which I'll talk  about those two in more depth later and so when   you're giving your reasons why what I encourage  you to focus on is giving them the reason why to do the next step and just that right every line  of copy sells reading the next line of copy and
(11:06) then those lines of copy sell the click and then  the click sells the and then the the landing page   that after comes from the click the headline of  that page sells the opt-in from the opt-in it sells showing up to the next thing is that we just  want to be very clear about our messaging one step   at a time because someone can't take nine steps  we want to sell one step and be very clear about what we want them to do next right a a confused  mind does not buy and a confused mind certainly does not click and so when I say thinking about  this as a fraterning party planner is what reasons
(11:34) does a fraterning party planner need in order to  plan a party not many at all the bar for having a reason to party is quite low timmy got his wisdom  teeth out kegger you know so John broke up with his girlfriend kegger uh it's Tuesday let's drink  right and so the idea is that you don't actually have to have a reason that's good in your mind you  just need to have a reason in general it could be   your birthday it could have been your birthday  last month it could be your wife's birthday it could be your dog's birthday right it could be  the anniversary of the business there's four   dates that you can run for a whole month right  it's my dad my dog's birth month this month and
(12:08) for that reason we're running this offer right  it does not matter now how do we make it even more compelling and this one's nasty this may be  if I had a favorite which is hard to say because it's like picking between your kids um which of  course everybody has a favorite child um kidding   calm down anyways uh is damaging admissions all  right there is probably I mean in my experience nothing more powerful than damaging admissions now  what's very interesting about this is they've done   research on basically the persuasiveness  of somebody who admits their bias upfront
(12:41) so if you say "Hey I make money from these videos  in the following ways." People even though they know that you admit you have a bias they are now  more likely to believe you because you said you have a bias because you've actually been truthful  and so you want to own your flaws and damaging admissions in my opinion are so powerful because  they're actually just rooted in truth so you want to always own your flaws of course you have them  of course your product isn't perfect say so and what you'll sacrifice in promise you'll gain in  trust and trust trumps promise think about the
(13:16) promises that you have to give to a referral very  little why because you are borrowing the trust of the introduction of the person so when you get a  referral you're like "Yeah uh you helped my friend   Sandy so I'll buy." You don't need to promise  much at all because they trust you and so I would rather always sacrifice promise to gain trust and  so there's a you know the famous Eminem story of uh he figured out when he was rapping that if he  owned all of his flaws and he said "I'm short and   I'm white and I'm blah blah blah blah." Right he  says all these things about them the other person
(13:44) has nothing left to say he pulls all the wind out  of their sales he pulls all the punches because he punches himself with that and then they have  nothing left and so basically we want to address   all of the concerns they have upfront in our  damaging admissions and so what happens is the the the linguistic power of this is that you have  statement but other statement and the statement that comes after the word but is the part that is  the thing you want them to believe and so you say something that is true and believable and damaging  to you so that they can believe that thing that
(14:18) comes after but so let me show you how this works  so if I said "Hey these markers smell like [ __ ] but they write four times longer than other  markers and they don't dry out." You're going   to be like "Wow I now believe that more than  if I just said these markers last four times longer than other markers before they dry out.
(14:42) " If  I said they smell terrible and or but they do that it's more persuasive now watch this let's flip it  these markers write four times longer than others but they smell like crap what am I emphasizing i'm  actually emphasizing the fact that they smell bad   not the fact that they write longer and so we  use the first part to gain trust for the second half of the statement viagra only works for 4  to 6 hours but you're going to have the time of your life right and so it might raise your  your blood pressure but you're going to have an amazing night right our websites are ugly as hell  but they convert right our systems are incredibly
(15:15) boring but they work right if I said our systems  work but they're incredibly boring I'm going to emphasize on the boring part not on the fact that  they work and so by how you organize your language   around words like but which are amplifiers it  allows you to say damaging admissions in a way that's compelling and so right now what I would  like you to do is write down all of the flaws all the things that people complain about the things  that you know you could do better and claim them   because the thing is that the prospect is already  thinking them but if you can claim them instead
(15:44) of them thinking them you acknowledge them gain  trust and then when you make your statements they   will believe you more so if you want to stand  out in a crowded marketplace tell the truth it makes you more authentic and if you can do with  humor you get even more bonus points so it's like   listen our gym has honestly pretty terrible  parking our AC is kind of on and off i don't have the best equipment but our sessions are more  fun than everyone else's cuz it's all we've got if I said that you now believe me right the thing  is is if you saw an ad that said that you'd be   like I kind of believe this guy he's probably  not so bad right he's telling the truth and I'll
(16:20) bet you his classes probably are fun now if I just  said "We have the most fun sessions." You wouldn't   believe me because anyone can say that but what  people won't say is the truth so number six show don't tell now this one is one of those ones that  you will probably nod your head on and be like "Yes of course show don't tell.
(16:46) " But the thing  is is when I say show don't tell I'm actually   talking more about breaking down the reasoning  so kind of like I was alluding to earlier which is instead of saying get more sales describe what  the experience of getting more sales means or what that moment would look like like selling somebody  that you're running out of order forms because   customers are reading their credit cards to you  over the phone too fast that is the experience of getting more sales right so you want to note the  descriptions of what's happening and the emotions they might experience the overwhelm of having  too many phones ring and not enough salespeople that's the experience of getting advertising that  works don't just say get more leads describe the
(17:19) experience of what getting more leads means  that's what they want to experience they want to see their gym full they want to know what it's  like to have a line around the corner they want   to know what it's like where they actually have  to reorganize their gym so that they can actually make room for more people at the session those  are the good problems that we would describe   which also yes they're problems but if we describe  the future problems they would prefer to have than their current problems those are arguably some  of the most compelling things you can include   in copy because if you can describe the problems  they haven't thought about yet then it's likely
(17:50) that you've experienced them or help other people  experience them which then increase the likelihood   that they believe it will happen for them and so  the big thing here in terms of show don't tell obviously from a creative perspective you want the  videos to demonstrate it you want your creative   your images to demonstrate it but your actual copy  itself you want to use more descriptive language that is specific to the experience they're going  to have the moments and I'm going to repeat this
(18:13) theme because it's big what is the moment that  someone's going to experience that they got more   sales what does that moment feel like what does it  look like when what moment will they realize that this has actually occurred show me that sales has  occurred describe to me that scenario that is how you write exceptional copy and what's cool about  this is if you want to write unique copy the way   you describe that moment will always be unique  to you compared to other people and so you can always have fresh copy that sounds different and  interesting because you're not just going to use   the same words everyone uses number seven tie  benefits to status whenever possible so a lot
(18:51) of people talk about benefits not features which  is true but I like to take this a step further mentally which is a cookbook so fast and easy that  all your friends will wonder how you found the time to be fit and cook for your family right that  would be okay that's one level right of benefit but the idea is what is the like in that benefit  what we tied in is we tied in their friends their friends are going to give them status because  of this thing which is just a cookbook right so   rather than say "Hey you're going to cook meals  fast and easy." Sure that might be an element of
(19:22) it right but so fast that their friends are going  to wonder how they're doing it is another level of this and so whenever we can tie status and this is  why in the in the lead's book I talk about this on page 140 i talk about the what who when framework  this is where this becomes incredibly important and so what we want to do when we're thinking  about status and the reason that this framework   works so well is that we're thinking about the who  right obviously it's them but who is giving them the status because their status within different  realms is it their family who's giving them status   is it their friends is it their colleagues  or co-workers is it their rivals is it their
(19:56) competitors who are they who are they vanquishing  and so humans are a competitive species we do desire status because it increases the likelihood  that we're able to procreate and create more kids   and acquire resources right and so we want to tie  all of our benefits to what it's going to do what they ultimately want which is going to be status  now what's interesting is that the status that   people get is going to be unique to that person  within their subgroup so if I'm going to try to describe status to a mother it's going to be  probably from kids that excel and other parents
(20:26) wonder how they're parenting not from getting a  Lamborghini right now if I'm trying to talk to a hustle bro who's 20 years old then probably  talking about a Lamborghini might convert now   it might not convert the type of hustle bro that  I would be looking for but nonetheless it would convert some person who's interested in that right  i'm all about mosy mobiles and having cash cars that you can buy for seven grand and then not have  to worry about car payment so you can actually   rich in your bank account rather than in other  people's eyes but point being if we're writing
(20:52) copy we have to meet them where they're at and so  the the wording that we think about this and also   just to give you more color on this is that we  think past present future so how am I going to create status for them with their spouse them with  their wife today and in the future and in the past so now I have multiple different people who are  giving and awarding status to this person through   the copy we're writing and different time periods  so it gives you endless variations and angles to approach the benefits all right and so you want  to think the lines so that you can or so that your   friend's mouths will drop with envy right that's  what we're trying to describe here number eight is
(21:25) that we want to use urgency and scarcity all right  now to be clear urgency and scarcity people lock them together but they're actually different  things all right so scarcity is a function of   quantity urgency is a function of time all right  so that means that I have an unlimited amount of widgets that I'm trying to sell but I'm only  running my promotion until midnight it's a it's a function of time that's urgency if I only have  a hundred widgets or I'm only choosing to sell 100 spots which scarcity you can choose to have then  at that point once a 100 spots maybe that takes a
(21:56) year to sell or maybe it takes 5 seconds to sell  that line in the sand no matter how many people   want to buy it after that point cannot buy it  now you can have both but fundamentally all we're trying to do is show that other people want it and  that they have to act quickly what we're trying to   do is decrease the action threshold threshold so  they take action and the key to making urgency and scarcity work is making it legitimate there's  actually I don't even know if there's really much more to it than actually having it be legitimate  there's there's really not another secret now   there's different types of urgency and scarcity  which I talk about in the offers books so I have
(22:30) a whole chapter uh in the offers books so page  104 for scarcity and then the next chapter right   afterwards I have for urgency which is uh page  112 and so I talk about four different types of urgency and different things that you can do to  include scarcity um in your offerings whether   it's products or services but no matter what  you just needed to be real that's all I can tell you and the part that people struggle with  is they're like but what if someone wants to buy   after midnight what if someone wants to buy when I  already said I have 100 spots it means you say no
(22:58) and you say no so you can maintain the reputation  so that the next time you have scarcity guess who   the first buyer is going to be the one who wasn't  able to buy the last time so you're digging your well before you're thirsty i would always prefer  to underell my demand so I always have more later   otherwise you're always going to be looking for  the next kill the next sale and you're going to be putting the scarcity urgency up but everyone  knows it doesn't matter because you're not going   to sell out and that's where you start losing  power now number nine is implied authority all
(23:22) right now this isn't this is a nasty one in a cool  way so this actually goes back to number one so if you're the only double secret black belt in the  area say it right if you've transformed over you   know a thousand people to black belts say so if  you're the only you know if you have a pro alete client and they allow you to say it say it all of  these things imply authority and people listen to and trust authority figures more and so that's  how we've helped 5,000 gyms or 6,000 gyms over the last seven years and so part of authority  is also just longevity if you say we've been in   business for 40 years the likelihood that you are  a legitimate business is pretty high right that's
(23:59) actually a pretty rare feat so if you've been in  business for a while that's a big thing now maybe   that you and your co-founders in aggregate have  done over 20 years of advertising maybe it's four of you guys have all done five years but it sounds  better to say in aggregate we've done over 20   years of advertising right now again the the key  here is if you have something as a hook like as seen on Oprah's best boot camps or best boot camp  in Vegas or best chiropractor in Vegas or best   whatever is this is why these tiny little awards  matter so much because you can actually even start
(24:27) a sales conversation with did you find us on the  Vegas best boot camps list now you might know that no one even knows that this list exists and that's  okay because that list just gives you applied authority when you actually have the conversation  with a prospect and so at the end of the day this   is where proof does beat promise all right and so  we're now getting into the believability of the claim right so this is why it's further down on  here because someone has to want the thing that   you're offering first once they offer it then all  their their warning bells are going to go off like
(24:59) "Why should I believe this person?" And that's  where you want to have the proof that yes they   can believe you and this is why documenting and  substantiating the things that you have done and the people that you have helped ultimately makes  you more likely to be persuasive right if you have a thousand people who have you know you have a  thousand testimonials versus somebody or a thou   imagine you go to a you see you looking between  two restaurants on Yelp right one has a fivestar with three reviews that's three there you go three  reviews right or you've got 3,000 reviews why not
(25:28) let's just stick with it all right but you've  got a 4.6 which one are you going for for sure   no question you're going to the one that has 4,000  reviews now it's 4,000 uh with a 4.6 rating rather than a five but that doesn't make sense this one  has five this is a 4.
(25:46) 6 the proof demonstrates the   implied authority that obviously these people  have been around they know what they're doing they service a lot of customers it's social proof  all right now number 10 always have a PS statement all right now why do we have a PS statement so  it's a power sentence which is what I like to   think about it all right is that power sentence  the the two most red parts of advertising number one the headline number two the PS statement  and so if you have the two most red lines in all of your advertising you better be sure you're  thinking about what you're writing and at the very   least have a PS statement right and so always  have them and make sure that they're strong and
(26:17) so I have a number of different strategies that I  use for PS statements and I'll tell you probably   my top three all right so number one in emails  I prefer to have some sort of sign off that gets people jazzed they're very excited to have I want  to reward them for having read my email so this   is where I put jokes in this is where I put fun  stuff that's light so that every once in a while when I do want to put a call to action I make this  PS a call to action that's strong because I know   everyone's going to read it and click it because  I've train them to click that link all right now
(26:45) in an advertising setting that PS statement is  either going to be a disclaimer of who this is not for which often works really really well hey by  the way if you're just getting started this isn't   for you this is only for people doing X Y and Z  click here that's very strong as a PS statement another PS statement that works very well is just  recapping everything in one sentence we've helped   a thousand people we're good at making black  belts if you're serious about black belts click here boom right and so it's like hey if you did  if you just read to the bottom and skip to the   bottom like I do this is the main this is the main  nuggets right your main points of persuasion all
(27:16) in one place now you can also piggyback on this  with a PPS statement and have two PS statements because guess what the only thing that's read uh  less than or sorry the only thing that's read more   than the normal copy but less than the headline  and the PS is the PPS that's the third most read statement in copy so I would also include  something there too if you need it now number 11 this one's going to be this one this is like it's  amazing how effective this is and also how simple it is and the only thing simpler is to not do it  so you have to have clear CTA so calls to action
(27:50) if you do not tell someone exactly what to do next  you decrease the likelihood that they do it so you want it to be stupid simple not you know what to  do you know you know you have to they don't know right and so if you want X click the button and on  the next page fill your information then select a convenient time for you to come in so that you  won't miss right we want to be very clear about   what they have to do and what's going to happen  next right they're not going to guess but here's a really really cool sub point about this if you  tell someone to take an option or take a step and
(28:23) then you tell them what's going to happen next  and then what you said is going to happen happens   you increase your sad do correspondence meaning  you gain influence over them because what you said after they followed your instruction came  true it's the reason Martha Stewart was such a powerful influencer compared to other people she  literally gave people recipes to follow and she said "If you want to bake a cake here's the 18  steps for baking a cake." And when you follow   these 18 steps you get a cake and then when you  get a cake and the cake the cake tastes good and
(28:52) then you tied to status because other people say  "This cake is amazing and your family loves you   for baking this cake." Guess what happens she  gains influence over you because the next time she gives you instructions you are more likely to  follow them and so we can embed this within the   process of persuasion so we want to basically  make promises keep promises make promises keep promises make promises keep promises over and  over and over again where they actually take   action and that's the key part is that they have  to take action on something you said and what
(29:17) you have to say will happen happens that's what  makes it it's not just saying "Oh open loop oh   just make promises." They have to take action  and then your promise gets fulfilled based on their action so outline step one two three and  outline what's going to happen next because when   it does they'll believe you the next time you  tell them to do something and like I believe in this so much the reason I called my whole company  acquisition.
(29:41) com was so that the name of my company was the call to action so if someone's like "Hey  how do I find out more about acquisition.com?" I had someone show up in my building and say "Hey  how do I apply to acquisition.com?" And I was like number 12 and this is a this is a this is so  good this is so good i mean all of these are good this is why I use these like I've really tried to  8020 this for you guys third grade reading level most copy doesn't convert because people have  to pause to understand it and the moment they   pause they stop because it takes more horsepower  than they're willing to dedicate to it so we have
(30:24) to assume that the prospect is in a rush doesn't  care about what you have has below a third grade reading level and is distracted and that's the  person we have to grab by the throat and bring   into our world this is the $100 million scaling  road map and what we did was we broke down the 10 stages of scaling and so if you're advertising  whether that be in emails for outreach or writing phone scripts or video sales letters or web  pages or making content all of these things are messaging that include copy to get people  to do stuff and so what we did was we broke   down all the different stages of scaling into  these 10 steps where you get stuck and how to
(31:00) break through and it's all absolutely free and  so if you're a business owner you're not sure   where you're at enter your business information  it's acquisition.com/roadmap and then on the thank you page if you'd like us to help you  with your marketing if you'd like us to help   you scale then I'd love to have you come out to  one of our workshops we run them monthly here at our headquarters in Vegas so on the thank you  page you can book a call but otherwise this   is absolutely free you don't need to attend a  call or anything like that to get this it's my
(31:22) gift to you so go acquisition.com/roadmap and  enjoy the rest of the video sentences that are   too complex or use too big of words you're not  writing a college paper right you're writing an ad that has milliseconds to catch someone's  attention so make the process as frictionless   as possible so if you want to make easy copy you  want to make light copy the way that you do that is you look at everything that makes copy hard  to understand you're writing hard to understand   and remove it so great copy the words fade into  the background no one's actually thinking about
(31:52) the words they're just understanding what it  says and then ultimately being more likely to   be persuaded by it so if I have something that's  written at ninth grade reading level but or third grade reading level so many people cannot rate at  a n read at a nth grade reading level many people can read but they can't read at that level and so  if we want to automatically disqualify twothirds of the people who read the copy keep it at  nth grade but if you want everyone who can   read to read then keep it at third grade  look at the most popular books in America
(32:23) they are purposely written because the authors  know what they're doing at a level that most   people can understand so fancy equals friction  simple equals sales i put every ad that I write through free reading level tool and I continue  to edit the copy as if it is third grade reading level now I'll give you a couple quick tips on  this all right so number one is you want short   sentences small words big promises right big  proof you want few adverbs and better verbs meaning instead of he quickly ran say he sprinted  and so we want word concision we want to have as
(32:57) few words as possible to communicate the point  but we want to keep the words themselves as simple   as possible now if you're like wait a second  sprinting versus running fast sprinting is a more advanced word and this is why writing copy is  difficult we have to think is there another word   that people also understand that I don't have  to use two words and I can use one now at the highest levels I will never prioritize concision  over simplicity so simplicity trumps concision meaning fewer words concision itself is like a  nth grade word all right um which is using fewer
(33:28) words to say the same thing as many words but you  probably understood it better that's what's crazy is this stuff actually works all right and  so these are 12 but you know I do like overd   delivering so I'm going to give you one more bonus  lucky number 13 all right so instead of 13 because that might be uh that might be unlucky so we'll  put bonus here i don't believe in superstition   but let's just roll with it is whenever possible  use humor all right because uh if you look at the Old Spice ad the highest converting ad of all time  to my knowledge um in terms of it took something   was a not a market leader and make it the made it  the the market share uh you know dominator is it
(34:04) was funny right and the thing is is that if you  can entertain and educate at the same time you   win right because entertainment makes something  significantly broader education is what's going to change someone's behavior and so we want our  ads to both entertain and educate entertainment   to go broad education to go deep the education  changes the behavior meaning that they take the click that means that they do what you want them  to do this is why now if I had to pick one thing to cut out it would be humor all right because the  you can make ads that convert with the other 12   but if you want the extra sauce right tickets to  that thing you've always wanted to go to right if
(34:37) you want that extra sizzle then you can add humor  in the difficulty is how do you make something   funny for everyone and this is where testing is  so important right if you look at how comedians I'm a big study of comedy because I really enjoy  it um how come comedians make their whole specials is that they will go to many many clubs test  new material and they might find when they do a   60-minute set that there's only eight minutes that  people really liked they then frontload the first eight minutes their next set and then they have  52 minutes of other stuff and they find two more   minutes that people like and they put it there  at the front for the next one now they've got
(35:07) 10 minutes and that's how they build their sets  until the whole 60 minutes is hilarious because   they've tested it in North Carolina and New York  and Mexico and internationally and so they've got something that just converts and by converts  it means it gets people to do what they want   them to do which in the context of comedy is  laughing right and so if we can make something that's both funny and educational ultimately we  win and if you like this then I have 13 years   of business insights that I've learned uh and  I think you'll absolutely love that video and

Transcript:
(00:00) When I was 17, I made $6 an hour. When I was 21, I got to $25 an hour. When I was 23, I got to $250 an hour. When I was 26, I got to $2,500 per hour. When I was 28, I got to $18,000 an hour. And so, in this video, I'll show you three ways to 10x your income. So, the first way is through something called arbitrage.
(00:16) And so, arbitrage is just a fancy word uh that means buying and selling between two different markets and capitalizing on the difference in price for the same asset. Now, there's a lot of ways that you can arbitrage. So this applies for both businesses and employees. Entire financial sector is almost built on arbitrage which is can I buy a stock uh for a certain price and then sell it later.
(00:39) And that's where you have options trading and all these other types of things um that banks and financial institutions will make hundreds of billions of dollars a year on. So, number one, on a personal level, you can uh buy cheap locally wherever you're at, and then sell whatever you have, like your services even to a more expensive market, which is why the number one money-making skill in 2024 is English.
(01:03) And so if you live in a foreign country and you live in Thailand or you live in Malaysia, you live in Vietnam, whatever, you have something where it's very cheap to live and then you can sell your services globally at the most expensive market rate, which would be probably Europe and the US, then you could in a real way have this big arbitrage between what you make and what you spend.
(01:25) And so, for example, in Thailand, the median income is about $2,700 per year. And so if you can sell your services even at the US median income, which is closer to like 50 or $60,000, you're looking at more than a 10x increase between what you make and what you spend. And wealth, which a lot of people don't understand, wealth is a ratio. It's not a number.
(01:47) It's the it's how much you spend relative to how much you make. So you can make $50,000 a month or $500,000 a month. If you spend more than that, you're going to feel poor. Now, if you make $5,000 a month and you spend 500, you're going to feel rich because you always have more than enough. And the key about wealth is having more than you need.
(02:04) And so, you can either make more or need less. So, let me show you this to you visually. So, personally, right, you have a couple options. So, one is your income stays the same, but you decrease your expenses by moving geographies. So, you change where you live. The other way is that you can live somewhere that's normal. It depends on where you're starting, right? And then sell to a different geography overall.
(02:36) Now, again, there's an interesting story that I'll tell you. When I had my really nice mansion in um Austin, this is years ago. Um I noticed that when people came to my house to bid services, I was like, I feel like this is way more expensive than a comparable service that I've paid for in the past.
(02:52) And then I started talking to my neighbors about it and they're like, "Oh, that's just called the zip code tax." And I was like, "What does that mean?" They're like, "You have a nice house. People will just raise the prices because they know you can afford it." And I was like, "Oh, well that sucks." Um, and so I learned about that.
(03:06) Um, now I'll tell you a real example of a company that I actually invested in. So, um, I live in a high-rise building now, and there was a guy who met me in the elevator and he literally elevator pitched me for his business idea. And I thought the business idea was actually really interesting and he had a prototype.
(03:24) He pulled it up on his phone literally. I mean it's I live high up so there's a decent amount of time in the elevator and um I ended up going to dinner with him and I ended up investing in the business and it's actually one of our portfolio companies and so uh I asked him though because I knew what the revenue of the business was.
(03:38) I was like how can you afford to live here? And he said I can't afford not to live here because I get to meet people like you. And so he was way living above his means, but the arbitrage that he was basically getting into was network arbitrage is that he was basically overpaying to have access to the best, you know, the people who had the most money in that specific market.
(03:58) And I still am not the biggest fan of that because it's so risky. But he ended up funding his entire growth of the software company um based on people that he met in our building. And so I find that kind of interesting. and he ended up proving it out and the company's actually really successful. So, it's definitely one of those like I wouldn't do it this way, but people have done it and it obviously worked.
(04:20) And so, these personal income things I still think completely apply to business because the only way you can go aggressive in business is being able to reinvest capital as you grow. And if you're just making income, the amount of capital that you have to get aggressive with is proportional to uh what you make versus what you spend.
(04:37) And so, it's like if you don't know how to make more, just spend way less. like when I uh started that the my first gym, I was first living on the floor. But even before that, when I made the transition, when I wasn't sure where I was going to have the gym, I lived in a spare bedroom for $400 a month.
(04:54) And so, like, I I I bring this up because it's not like I was balling out. And mind you, I had money saved up. I had $50,000 saved up and I was making at the time about $4,000 a month um from training people online before I made my transition to my gym. And so I I say this to say like I strongly encourage you to employ some level of arbitrage within your life either in your business or personally or both.
(05:16) And you can do that geographically. You can do it via network. Or you can just do it by massively decreasing your spend by spreading your expenses between more people which is how I just just shared a bedroom uh with somebody and only bought food from Costco and that was the only food that I ate. And so at the most basic level, all business actually comes down to some sort of arbitrage because even if you have a skill difference from someone else, you have an information advantage.
(05:41) And so the arbitrage you have is that it c you know how to do something for less than it costs someone else to do it. And so they pay you to do that thing. And the arbitrage between what it cost you and what you charge them is how you make a profit. And so arbitrage is absolutely at the core of everything economic where basically profit is created.
(06:00) The best part about arbitrage is that you can employ it at all levels of personal income. So even if you're just working a job versus you make a ton of money uh in your business. There are levels of it and I would encourage you to start when you have nothing because you basically arbitrage is a way of thinking.
(06:14) It's like how will I live my life in a way that I always have this this differential between what something costs me and what I can sell it for in the future. So, the second way that you can 10x your income is through increasing the number of people who know who you are. Now, the way to do that is to give away amazing stuff for free.
(06:34) All right? And so, giveaways is one of the strongest uh I mean, they're so strong that they're literally regulated by the government. That's a really good telltale sign that something works is that the government steps in because it's so powerful that people abuse it. And so, the two most powerful words in marketing are free and new.
(06:52) And so when you have a new giveaway, you want to have it be something free. Now, I have been able to 10x my income multiple times in my life, like I said earlier. Um, and I have done it basically in every business through some sort of giveaway. And I'll explain what that is. So, the first massive increase when I talked about um was actually through something that we called the six week challenge.
(07:13) All right? Which was where we actually just gave away uh six weeks of service and accountability and workouts and nutrition planning and everything to people. Now, no one else in my market could compete against that because they were just giving trials, 14 days, sometimes 21 days, and it was just like workouts or it was just access to the gym. I gave away a full program.
(07:30) Now, I had a way of structuring it so that they would pay, but then they'd get the money back if they did it, and that encouraged people to uh to give it a shot. But, it was it was what took the gym to a completely different stratosphere. And just trying to do traditional marketing just didn't really work that well, or at least I got traditional results, which were mediocre.
(07:48) Now the next uh big thing that I did was uh in gym launch I wrote the gym launch secrets book. And you'll notice this is a common theme for me uh is that I write books before I get into any market. And I do that for a couple reasons. One is that when I write a book before I get into a market, the writing process itself is actually a learning process for me.
(08:04) And so it's like how much can I learn? How much can I consolidate um and synthesize information uh to put it into a really coherent way because I think writing is one of the best ways of learning how to think. And so the gym launch secrets book, the reason this was so crazy is that it outlines everything that we did to turn around gyms.
(08:19) And I was so afraid to publish this because I was like, "Oh my god, it's going to be all my secrets. Everyone's going to have it." But then this is where a lot of the give away the secrets, sell the implementation mindset came from. And so you should never be afraid of the things that you're giving away.
(08:33) And this this process of doing these types of giveaways is what generates huge amounts of demand. And so fundamentally, if you're going to grow a business, you either got to get way more customers if it would 10x. It's like we got to 10x the customers. We got to 10x how much they're worth. And I'll get to that later.
(08:46) So, I'm going to put something to rest that you're probably worried about. I was so frightened to launch Gym Launch Secrets, the book, because it was like this is everything that I learned. I was like, "This is like my life's work." Um, in this book, it's 400 pages of how to just run a gym. Like, it's it's everything.
(09:00) It's like the trainer ads, the the salesman ads, the training, the scripts, how to set up your lobby, like the the the the upsell process, the different pricing packages, how to do semi-private, how to do larger, like everything was in there. And I will say this, like at a lot of big decision points in my life, like Ila kind of like put her hand on my shoulder and she's like, "If you're afraid that it's too good, it's probably the right thing to give away.
(09:21) " And I remember being like, "All right, like like here goes nothing, you know, like this could destroy us." But the thing that ended up happening is two things. One is that all my sales team was like, "Can you give away more books?" Anybody who's read the book is like so bought into our method, our way of doing things.
(09:38) like they immediately like we don't have to sell them on the gym launch way. They just like they're like can we just I just need your help. I want to do it right. I want to do it right the first time. I don't want to try and like trial and error this thing which was the goal. But the sales guy saying that I was like okay well that's super encouraging.
(09:51) And the second thing I'll tell you later but this one is one of the most effective ways and I'll give a couple more examples. So when I uh started my software company Allen what I did was I gave away and this is crazy. I gave away basically unlimited coaching and uh training like a whole course that most people would charge a gazillion dollars for.
(10:13) I just gave it away for anybody who used my software. And so with Allen, we were able to go from zero to $1.7 million per month. All right, just using this within six months. And so most people were trying to charge agency owners like show them how to sell customers, how to how to package their offers, how to run ads. I did all of that for free for anyone who just used my software.
(10:36) And so that was like a crazy offer. That was a crazy giveaway. And that's what generated a ton of demand inbound for Prestige Labs, which was my supplement company. The big thing that I gave away there was the entire what I called supplement selling secrets. I I used to say secrets a lot. I don't say it anymore. Um, but I had I I eventually called it S3, which was the selling system uh for supplements.
(10:55) And so this is something that had made me I mean so much money in my gym career that it took me two years to release it because I was like I held it so close to my chest. Hey, if you actually want to implement this in your business, just send this video to whoever is going to be implementing it or your partner or just to yourself if you need to or share it to your story.
(11:12) It would mean the world to me. Otherwise, back to the video. But basically, instead of selling this, I just gave it away and then I just encouraged people to sell my product. Now the thing is is that people could take this and many people did. They just took the selling system and then just sold other supplements. But I had built prestige to have specific technical components into how the business was operated that made it it made it so much more advantageous for people who went through this training to use my supplements. So it's like I
(11:38) showed people how to sell massive bundles, how to sell subscriptions, all of these things. And I priced it so that anybody who would sell would be able to have a discount far below what someone could get for retail. And so it was specifically made for people who were going to go through this free giveaway. And you're like, man, did he stop there? No.
(11:56) Because with school, like right now, for example, we're giving a $100,000 away uh or a cyber truck to the person who uses the software, right, and gets um and builds the biggest group uh within a 30-day period. And we've done uh three of these so far, and I think we're doing another one here in December. But the thing here is that this is what generates a ton of demand on the front end.
(12:16) And so, it's like if you want to if you want to 10x, you can't do an incremental change. you have to do an order of magnitude difference. And so that comes from giving away actual tangible value, real stuff. Like people were charging $10,000, $20,000 for what I was giving away here for free. Um, and the thing is it's not like, oh, I just like just like tossed it up.
(12:36) I actually had the support the same way somebody who ran a business that had like a coaching business would run it, except I just did it for free. And with Prestige Labs, same thing. We had reps who would go out, call the gym owners up, train their teams on how to sell the product. All stuff that you'd normally charge for, we did for free.
(12:51) Um, gym launch secrets, six week challenge, the $100,000, like all of these things had real costs that we were willing to incur because it generated so much more demand that it was offset with the amount of customers that we could bring in the door. And the only way that you can do a giveaway longterm is that you have to have some sort of product that you know you're going to sell in the back end.
(13:10) Like you have to still have a monetization system that makes sense. like it still has to lead to uh something. So like here it's like cool this led to the memberships, right? And then gym launch secret led to gym launch which was the licensing, right? And then Allan led to the software. Prestige Labs led to the products.
(13:25) And so each of them basically I gave away this thing that was really valuable. But then it led to we monetized a different way, which I've said this before, but my favorite business model in the entire world is look at what everyone else is buying, make it better, make it free, monetize another way. And so even with uh acquisition.
(13:42) com I wrote both the books uh that are free and I just just recently released the scaling roadmap uh which you know most people charge a gazillion dollars for. It's 14 hours uh and every single stage has 30-ish pages of what you need to do uh to solve the problems to get to the next level. And it's free. You can just go get it. It's on the site.
(13:59) But the whole point here is that this is what this allows you to provide outsized value to people. And it's I I bring this up and I show each of these examples, right? because people don't believe me or at least they I see the giveaways people do and they're just lame. They either don't do it because they're afraid of giving too much value away or they give away something that just doesn't have a lot of value.
(14:17) But you the the key is that there has to be some sort of hard cost that people can actually realize like oh this is real value that I'm getting for free because otherwise you don't have reciprocity. We want to jam value into someone else's wallet so that they then have to transfer it back to us in the form of money later.
(14:34) Now the big key here is that you got to be willing to wait. But if you can do that, the cool thing is is that so few people have that level of discipline. This strategy will literally always be available. I can shout it from the rooftops and still 95% of you aren't going to do it. And so if you're like, how do I come up with this thing that I give away for free um in$und00 million leads, I wrote a whole chapter on this, engage your leads uh with offers and lead magnets.
(14:56) And I basically break down exactly what you need to do and how to think about lead magnets in general, how they generate more money for you, and kind of the different types of lead magnets that you can You can reveal a problem, you can do free trial, you can do a onestep and a multi-step process. Um, and so each ones of these are are are different versions of this.
(15:13) So if I if we were to look at this as our as our as our little rubric here, right? Six week challenge is going to be uh essentially a three-step and a multi-step process because most people who work out for six weeks want to work out more later, right? So it's like, okay, cool. You're going to need this other thing later. Gym Launch Secrets.
(15:29) This one was more about revealing a problem. So, it shows all the things that you need to do and then people are like, "Oh my god, this is so overwhelming. There's a lot of things I need to do to fix my gym. It'd be nice if I had help." And so, then they they take the next natural step. With Allen, same thing.
(15:44) Now, with this business, the way that this model was kind of structured was almost like a premium where again, you solve a problem for someone, you help them grow their agency, and then they're going to need the software even more. And the way the software was structured, it build um Prestige Labs. So with with uh with this the basically the problem that they had is they didn't have a supplement sales system.
(16:03) Once they implemented the supplement sales system the next problem they would naturally have is what supplements do I sell which duh we have prestige labs right and so in each of these cases you want to think about can I reveal a problem for my prospect can I give them a trial of the thing I have or is it one step in a multi-step process and I give examples of these and then you can have different delivery mechanisms which I won't get into but you can check that out there.
(16:23) So, the third way to 10x your income is through making customers worth more, which is going to come down to in the fastest way possible, pricing. And so, I talk about price a ton. And it's because it's the most powerful lever on profit. And if you're in the game to make more money, then you should try and raise it.
(16:41) And so, the nice thing with this is that you can do this again, whether you're an employee or you're a solarreneur or you're at a, you know, super big business, it works the same way. Um, so you got your pricing lever. Okay. So, as an employee, you basically have three options. All right. So, number one is you can simply ask for more money.
(17:01) Now, I don't recommend doing that because you're not going to 10x your income that way. So, then it's like, okay, so if I just ask for more, ask. Okay, I might get a little bit of a raise if I'm good. If I'm not, they might just say no. The way to really ask for it is to take on more risk. And so you will be compensated for the amount of value you create, your ability to negotiate, how replaceable that skill is, and most importantly, the risk you're willing to take on.
(17:30) And so a business owner gets paid more than the employees in the business because the business owner takes on more risk. Right? Eduardo Savin, who was the first investor in Facebook, he put $30,000 up and that was worth a gazillion dollars today. and he really didn't do much besides providing the first $30,000 of capital for the servers for Facebook to begin.
(17:48) And so he took on risk and as a result of that, despite not really doing any work, he was able to make a significant amount of money. Now, as an employee, what does taking on risk look like? It means that you switch to a percentage of your compensation or the entirety of your compensation based on some key metric that you have responsibility over that you can draw a connection between what you do and how much revenue or profit the company makes.
(18:10) Now, in some positions, like sales, it's a little bit easier to draw that. And that's typically how those roles are structured. But if you know your job well, then you can think of ways to tie what you do to what the company makes. And you should do that because the closer you can tie yourself to revenue, the more valuable you will be.
(18:26) The third thing you can do as an employee is you can just switch, right? You can start applying to other roles uh either within the business or in other businesses. And I actually think that the within business swap is one of the most underrated. So like in terms of which one of these will make you the most money.
(18:42) This will probably make you the most which is you taking on risk. You switching sometimes you can get a significantly larger raise than simply asking. And I think the reason for that is that if you have if you're in a role where there's multiple people in your role it sets a precedent for the business that even if you're a higher performer that they feel like they have to then increase everyone else's pay which is kind of a risk to the business.
(19:01) Basically here you ask the business to take on more risk versus here you take on more of that risk. Now the switch allows the business to maintain face and allow you to get into a role that takes on more responsibility or has a different title and then you can earn according to that. Now the final thing here is obviously you can start a business which then would switch your category overall.
(19:23) But let's talk about that. So the pricing lever here is really related to your income. The pricing lever here in businesses is related to what you sell. Now I want to be really clear here. An employee sells your services. You just sell them on a recurring contract. But fundamentally it's what it is. And so I think people see these in very different categories.
(19:38) I don't see them as that different uh personally. Obviously the only real difference is risk. Now from a business perspect because think about like this. What's the difference in an employee in 1099? Mostly government but the actual day-to-day obviously there's control and you know have to show up on time and you can have other you know other other customers but the actual like what you do doesn't phenomenally change between being an employee and being a 109 but a 1099 is a business owner and an employee isn't. And so I
(20:02) just think that if I can if I can smooth over that wall, I think a lot more people would be willing to take the risk because fundamentally like the doingness is not that dissimilar. And so here you have services which you sell your time for and you have a price which is your salary or or the way that you negotiate your compensation and that's it.
(20:20) Now as a business owner you do the exact same thing. But instead of having one boss, you have many bosses and you have to talk to them every day which are going to be your customers. And so um I have talked at this at length and still no none of you do it. So the big thing to do here is implement a price anchor.
(20:35) Now a price anchor is basically just a price that you put way above your normal prices that mentally anchors how people perceive the remainder of your menu. And so people actually frame all numbers with respect to the numbers they heard first. And so by the way, if you're ever selling something, you want to include even earlier in the presentation massive numbers.
(20:55) Even if it has nothing to do with the price that you mentioned later, just big numbers will will frame people's minds in big big thoughts. So that when you say uh and I'll give you I'll give you a simple example and then I'll tell you a story. So if I said $10,000, right, and then I said $100, it sounds very different than me saying $100, $10,000, right? It's a it's a different shift in terms of oh my god, that's so many different units.
(21:19) Right? Now, obviously, you heard the first one first, and that does influence it, but big picture, the anchor makes everything else seem cheap by comparison. And so, let me tell you the story about a crazy steakhouse that SB made. There's this uh restaurant uh by Salt Bay, who's like a meme, but he actually has like, I think, like 10 or 11 locations, something like that, called Nerret.
(21:38) And so, Nerret is a a super expensive steakhouse. And everything they have is a little bit more than the very expensive steakouses. So, like a normal steak there is, I want to say like 90 bucks, which is pretty steep, at least today. Uh, even for a high-end steak place, maybe a hundred. All right, but here's the thing is that they have this gold menu, which they just wrap the meat in gold foil, and they charge like $2,000 to $3,000 for these steaks.
(22:04) And you're thinking, why on earth would someone go and spend $2 or $3,000? Because they want someone to know they spent $200 or $3,000. And so that would be by its very different a luxury item where the price of the thing itself uh confers the value to the product. Meaning the more expensive it is the more desirable it is.
(22:21) And the key to luxury products is that other people know how expensive it is so that you get status by proxy by being able to afford the product. Now that's very different than a premium product where the value isn't in the fact that it's expensive. The value is in the fact that it is significantly more valuable in terms of the result or experience that it delivers.
(22:39) This is what we call in the biz a profit maximizer. And so what a lot of entrepreneurs especially don't understand is that the thing you sell most of isn't necessarily the thing you make the most money on. All right? So let me say that again. So if you look at McDonald's for example, they sell burgers. They don't make a lot of money on burgers.
(23:00) If they only sold burgers, they would go out of business. And so even though it's the core product, it's not the profit maximizer. They make significantly more money on fries and Coke because the margins on fries and coke are way way better than meat and a bun and fresh lettuce and tomatoes and onions and all the other stuff. And so the thing you sell the most amount of is not always the thing you make the most money on.
(23:22) And so you can absolutely build like their business now McDonald's corporate's business is real estate, but the franchisee business is really the the Coke, ice cream, and and and fries business because that's where they make the disproportionate amount of their profit. And so this is why the giveaway thing that I was mentioning earlier is so important is that you can have this very valuable thing that you give away for free and then you maximize your profit with this other thing that's significantly more expensive that is typically going to be a very more
(23:47) handheld more done for you more heavy service more concierge more white glove version of whatever it is that you sell. Now if you sell on the product side typically it's going to have to be newer designs different materials uh that will make a better experience. So, a friend of mine actually implemented this into his uh online business, and he had this he just created this super expensive 101 version of his thing that was 10 times more expensive.
(24:12) So, his thing was $500 a month. He charged $5,000 a month for this. It was a business to consumer business. And what the craziest thing happened. He then had a ton of people take this more valuable offer, which he had zero intention of actually selling. He just wanted to have more people buy the next thing. But not only that, a higher percentage of people bought his previously most expensive package because it looked like the much more affordable, more reasonable middle option.
(24:36) Because I want to overd deliver, I'm also giving you a fourth bonus way of 10xing your income. And so if leverage is getting more for what we put in, then we want to take maximal advantage of the assets we already have. And so a big part of doing that is saying, okay, who do I already know? And so you want to hit your list with the combination of those three things.
(24:56) So you're like, "Okay, I'm going to arbitrage myself and basically sell stuff for more than it cost me. I'm going to live in places that cost me less than what I need to spend so I can be more aggressive and take on less personal risk so I can take on more business risk." Cool. Next thing you're like, "Okay, I need to give something amazingly valuable away." Got it.
(25:12) That generates more leads. Then I'm going to upsell people into a super expensive thing. Got it. And so then finally the question would be like okay well who am I going to do this to and so this is where you look at your cell phone you look at your email list you look at your when I say email list just literally the contacts that are in your email not like you've developed some email lists now if you're a business obviously you should have an email list and if you don't shame on you all right so you've got your cell phone you've got your email
(25:35) list um on top of that you've got all socials and then let them know about this free thing that you have and then create the ascension process that naturally leads from the giveaway where you solved a problem. Uh sorry, you revealed a problem, you gave them a trial of a solution or a one-part solution to a multi-step solution so that they then naturally want to buy your next thing.
(26:00) And so our largest portfolio company actually ran this exact play. And in one email campaign, all right, so literally just like a three email uh blast, right, to the list that they had, they drove everyone to a webinar where they just said, "Hey, here's this amazing offer and they were able to make $2.3 million from this one campaign.
(26:24) " Now, obviously, this is a business that has millions of emails on the list, but I mean, I don't know what your income is now, but three emails for 2.3 million ain't bad. And so if we scaled this down on one/10enth, then it would be $230,000. And if we did it 100x less, then it'd be $23,000. But this is a great way to implement all of the stuff that I just said immediately. Yeah.
(26:44) And the reason that this is one of the strongest ways of 10xing your income, there's no real additional cost, right? And so you're just making money for not a lot of cost because we've already incurred the cost of getting the customers. And so again, arbitrage being a theme here, like we already paid for this, so cost is zero, and we're going to sell this thing that cost a lot to them, but not much for us.
(27:03) And if you like this video, you're going to love this video on 10 ways to make a million dollars.

Stop Caring What Others Think of You So Much - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqjGxVW-Ae0

Transcript:
(00:00) The easiest way to lose in life is to try to avoid looking bad. So you have to stop caring about what other people think of you. I'm Alex Shamuzzi. I own acquisition.com. It's a portfolio companies that generate last year over 250 million in aggregate revenue. Along the way, I've had to work and push through a lot of things that other people disagree with.
(00:17) I had to lose friends along the way, people who didn't agree or approve of my lifestyle, family as well. And so this video is just going out to anyone that resonates with that or you're in a period of life where you know you need to separate from the pack in order to create the new pack that you want to be a part of.
(00:35) And so what I want to do is give you some reframes on how to change your perspective on how other people see and think of you. That won't necessarily make it easier to not care about what they think, but more so still allow you to operate anyways because at the end of the day, the work just needs doing. And so number one, ignore the opinions of losers. So hear me out.
(00:51) Richer people won't judge you for saving your money. Fitter people won't judge you for cutting calories or packing your food or deciding to eat a certain way. Right? Higher status people aren't going to judge you for cutting bad friends. It's the people going nowhere who have the most to say because they have nothing to do.
(01:11) And so take the fact that they have something to say as an indication that they're not doing anything else with their time. Not that it's some sort of sign that you need to change your life or change direction. You're probably on the right path. They are leading indicators. Their hate, their snide remarks, the little like you're missing this, you're not doing that.
(01:28) Those are actually positive indicators despite the fact they hurt because you're kind of still transitioning your programming from the way that you used to be to the way that you want to be. And so if you're trying to be successful and you're facing big life decisions, don't listen to the people closest to you. Listen to the people who are closest to your goals.
(01:45) And I think that if you are in a situation where there's no one around you who's closest to your goals, then it means that you're going to have to consume information from the outside. It's almost like you have to separate your brain from your body. You need all your consumption of information to be from people who are where you want to be. And you can have your body for now in a place where it doesn't want to be.
(02:01) But in time, once your reality catches up, you can actually move your body to a place that now makes it even easier for you to consume the things that you need to get to where you want to go. And so fundamentally, if you don't want someone's life, don't take their advice. If you don't like the way they live, if you wouldn't swap places with them, if you don't like the way they have a relationship with their wife or their girlfriend, or you don't like how they think about work or you don't like how if they're, you know, not in shape, they're not in any of the you don't envy them in any domain, why would you value their advice? And if you think this is
(02:27) something that I'm saying because I'm trying to do from a pedestal, like I promise you, like I gain nothing from these videos, like and if you're like, why does Alex even bother making these videos rather than just like all the business stuff that I normally talk about? because these these concepts were the things that laid the foundation for meble to do the things I had to do in business if I didn't have this base level programming. I couldn't do anything else afterwards.
(02:45) And so I also don't say this to somebody who didn't go through that. Like for me the hardest decision to my whole life, the hardest decision that I ever had to go through was quitting my job.
(02:57) And it sounds like such a basic thing, but for me the job that I had had was basically the culmination of everything that I had done at that point. Like I was caring about what college I was going to go to in middle school. I know that's very hard for some people to grasp because that's like not your reality, but for me that was reality. I remember thinking, are they going to look at my eighth grade transcripts? Like I didn't know.
(03:07) And to be fair, I was a little bit lied to by my parents, but like we'll just leave it like that, right? And so when I went to high school, like the extracurriculars that I took, the fact a three sport varsity athlete, the fact that I wanted to become the literary magazine editor and chief for my high school and vice editor of the newspaper, like I did all that stuff because I wanted to get to college.
(03:24) Then when I went, you know, studied for the SD, I got into Vanderbilt. And then when I went to Vanderbilt, I graduated in three years because I was like, if I do that, and while I was there, I was vice president of the power of the team and president of my fraternity.
(03:37) And like while I was there, I was like, "Okay, if I max this this transcript, maybe just maybe I'll get a great job." And I did get a good job out of college. I had a white collar consulting job, which is kind of like one of the you either go investment banker consulting at the high echelon schools. And so like this job was the culmination of everything that I had done in my life at that point.
(03:54) And here's the part that really sucked is that like for me, my dad was really happy with my life. He and I would get lunch a couple times a week. He would just like he would, you know, brag about, you know, his son who's the businessman. I was working. I was a consultant. I was a businessman. It's He's like, "You're following the plan." He's like, "You do this for a few years.
(04:10) You go back to business school, get your MBA, you do the next thing, right?" And so, it was always the next thing. The thing is is that it was this, it was a path. And I knew that me getting off of it literally meant that I had to forsake basically all the friends that I had locally in Baltimore cuz I came back home. second because all the guys that I knew who followed the same path, me stepping off that path is almost me.
(04:29) It's like unspoken talking about the path that they're still following. And I think that's the really nasty one is that if you start doing something different than everyone else is doing, they assume that you're attacking them for living their lives out. I don't know why people do this, but they do it.
(04:45) And so a lot of ways they want you to fail because they want confirmation that the path that they're on is the right path. and they want you to fail with the risk that you choose to take because it confirms the fact that they that they shouldn't take the risk that they weren't willing to take. And so don't be upset when people have these snide remarks. It's because they're actually protecting their own egos. It took me a lot longer to figure that out.
(05:03) And so just reminding myself that like, hey, I've been able to boil down almost all criticism from other people in my life to this statement. So please listen to it carefully. You do not live in a way that I would prefer. That's all it is. Every single remark, why are you doing this? Blah blah blah. It just comes down to you live your life in a way that I wouldn't prefer. And the answer to that is of course not cuz it's my life.
(05:21) You should live your life in the way that you prefer. Why should I live my life in the way that you prefer? That makes no sense. But when as soon as I I got that translation, that reframe, it somehow just like it it was like the volume of the world turned down for me. Oh, okay. Why aren't you going to be at this guy's the the fantasy football thing? Why aren't you go to this destination? Why? I was like, dude, I'm trying to save money.
(05:40) I don't like I can't afford that in time. I can't afford that with money, you know? And that's why I'm like I got some flack, you know, online where I was like, "Hey, I didn't go to a lot of friends weddings when I was in my 20s." They're like, "These are once once in a lifetime thing." Hey, first off, half divorced.
(05:50) Second off, the thing is is like if they're real friends, like real real friends, couple things. One, if they're real real friends, they won't care because you're actually real friends. Second, if they're real real friends, you probably only have like two of them, like real friends. If you're like, "No, I've got like 40 friends.
(06:02) " Like you don't have like you have acquaintances, you have people you've met who invite you to pay money to come to their thing, their party. It's just a party. It's all it is, right? Obviously, for those of you religious, whatever, there's that attitude, don't get me wrong.
(06:15) But even so, your attendance does not in any way impact the quality of their marriage. It also doesn't really impact the quality of their friendship. And if your friendship is lost, a lifetime of friendship is lost over your attendance over a party, then you're probably it's probably not a friendship worth keeping. And so, that was always my perspective. Two of the closest friends I had, I actually couldn't is so crazy.
(06:32) Two of the weddings that I probably would have considered going to during that decade both happened within the same two weeks. And Leila and I both got COVID in those two weeks. And so I actually didn't go to the two weddings I probably would have gone to. Now guess what? I'm still friends with both of them and they don't care.
(06:44) So it's this idea because when you're a kid or you're younger these feel like these massive milestones, but like as you get older like this stuff just shrinks into irrelevance. It just doesn't matter.
(06:56) The things that do matter is that the relationship you had wasn't going to be predicated on whether you you attended something a party. So number two, extreme people get extreme results. Now this one's near and dear to my heart. So I'll tell you why. So my father is a big believer in astrology. So zodiac stuff. So my whole upbringing he was like you're, you know, he had all these book these big fat books on like what your life's going to be and all this kind of stuff. And my dad's a smart guy.
(07:15) He just likes it. So anyways, I'm a Leo 2 or three. I think I'm a Leo 3 and he's a Libra. So Libras are balances. And so I would say that if there was one thing my dad repeated to me the most throughout my entire upbringing, the most the number one most repeated statement was balance. He'd always say balance. Balance. You just say just one word, balance. Balance. Balance. Cuz he was like, you're so unbalanced. you're so extreme.
(07:39) And this one's near and dear to my heart because I was told my whole life that I was unbalanced, that I was too extreme, that I was too hardcore, that I was too allin, that I was too obsessive about everything. And I honestly had to fight to be me. And I'm making this because it's not common to be unbalanced. It's more common to be mediocre.
(07:58) Like the people who obsess about work life balance tend to be mediocre at both. And so like if you want something, you have to go get it. It's it's like this entropy. Like the world will try to drag you down and make you a part of it. It will try to dilute who you are. It will try to make you fit into the mold that they accept.
(08:16) And so like you have to be willing to be extreme to get an extreme result because many of the goals and aspirations that you have probably are above average. Like actually if you look at you're like I want to make a million dollars a year. Fine. Guess how rare that is. You want to guess? It's not 1%. 1% 600k in the US. And if you're global, forget about it. So you want to make a million dollars a year. That's not even a one out of a 100red goal.
(08:35) It's a one out of 200, one out of 300 goal. And you have that goal and you think that somehow you're going to behave like the 299 and get there. It's not normal. It's unbalanced. You have to take unrelenting, obsessive amounts of action for a disproportionate period of time where you get zero reward for doing so.
(08:54) If anything, you just get disproportionate punishment for taking this. And you get and you question your own sanity half the time because you're like, "Am I just being crazy? Is it insane for me to have these aspirations, these goals, these dreams for my life?" And everyone around you will tell you yes.
(09:07) because it's in their best interest because it makes it your failure protects their ego. And so people demand success but refuse to work. Right? They won't work weekends. People want opportunity but won't talk to strangers. People claim ambition but they sleep in every day. Right? We're the result of our actions, not our aspirations.
(09:25) So many people have the same goal as you, but very few of them will do the same work as you. And so you have to have uneven work to have an uneven goal. Yeah. Broke the leash when I left. That was like it was [ __ ] My dad was like, "I'll see you never." So, number three, and this is a big one, raise your standards.
(09:41) Now, a lot what's interesting about standards more than the other first two things that I just brought up is that standards actually have to come down to beliefs of what you think is possible. And the beliefs of what you believe are possible create the construct within which you live your life. And so, we live inside of prisons of our own making based on our belief system.
(09:58) And so, if you want to change your life, you have to change your belief system. Now, I'm not getting woo woo. Calm down. A belief system is just a different way of saying things that you know or believe to be true. These are just the facts that you live on. Now thing is is we can't double check every single thing that we believe because we can't it just it would take too long, right? As a human being, if you every single thing you had to fact check.
(10:14) So the vast majority of the things that we believe and take as true were just given to us by other people. It's what I find very interesting about this is that we are so hesitant to question our beliefs when in reality almost none of our beliefs are our own. They're not yours. They're someone else's. And so I'll say something that I can maybe just do my very best to translate to you.
(10:32) For many people, working around somebody who's a super high achiever, a super high performer shifts their worldview because they they see a different way of operating and a lot of it comes down to what that person demands and expects of the world and reality. I'll give you an example. So I'm relatively good friends with Jimmy, Mr. Beast.
(10:50) Just from happen stance, we've we've created a a good friendship. And I've read Elon's biography by Walter Isacson and Jobs. Some of the friends that I have that are, you know, billionaires and whatnot. They have this streak. And the streak is a level of unreasonleness around their goals and what they believe to be possible that they just do not accept less. And so Munger said this thing that I really like a lot, Charlie Mer.
(11:16) He said, "Never underestimate the man who overestimates himself." And I think there's something to that. like he Charlie Mer hated men who had big egos, crazy aspirations. He thought it was really risky, but at the same time he also said they tend to win. And I think that there's a huge element of truth. Like I think many people who know me would consider me to be one of the most unreasonable people that they have met.
(11:34) And it's not like in a way of purposely trying to be combative with other people, but more so when you witness someone say, "Hey, I need this done tomorrow." And then one by one disassembling every single person around them who tells them why it can't be done.
(11:51) And then once the 20 different voices you've told them why their idea can't work and they've just eviscerated every single one of them. It's like great. So tomorrow then right it's like they will stand there. They will take the brunt of the storm from the whole army to be like I know this is possible. Tell me why physically we cannot do this. If you cannot break it down to physics then it is possible and we're going to do it. Tell me what is stopping us.
(12:08) And then just systematically destroying every one of these obstacles to make something that for most people will seem impossible possible. And so the thing is is like of the people that I've seen that have just been absolutely crazy high performers, they've all been like this. And so the thing is is that it's so rare.
(12:24) And so if you have this drive, this determination, this thing inside of you're like, why isn't anyone think this is so important? Like this is the most important thing, right? And so there's this great visual that I want to draw for you real quick. Hopefully I won't mess up my own little clean clean slate here, but I'm going to draw for you cuz I really love this.
(12:40) So Paul Graham, who's the founder of Y Combinator, had this little tweet about this that I really like. And he said, "If you have intelligence, you know, on one line here, and then you have determination on the other line." He said, "Let's say you've got a 100 points like you're building a character for a video game on either side of this line." He said, "If you take down determination, you know, one point at a time and you keep intelligence, pretty quickly you have this very smart person who doesn't do anything and convinces themselves that like nothing nothing will happen." He said, "But the interesting thing is that if you keep
(13:04) taking intelligence down, he said, you can keep going, but when you have somebody who's 100 out of a 100red determined," he's like, "They tend to just still be very successful." He said which is why determination even more so far more so than intelligence is the determinant of success.
(13:20) And so when they look at that in Y combinator how do you operationalize determination? So determination from a behavior perspective in my opinion comes down to the it's it's an extinction curve. All right. So an extinction curve I'll give you a simple example. I'll give you two examples to drive it home. Let's say you knock on a door right? No one opens or nothing happens. Right? So that's a null outcome.
(13:37) You do something nothing happens. Some people will knock again. They have a longer extension curve than somebody only knocks once. Nothing happen. A smaller percentage, a much smaller percentage will knock a third time. Nothing happens. A significantly smaller percentage will knock a fourth time. Nothing happens. A significantly smaller percentage will knock a fifth time.
(13:55) And it's the maniacs who will stand there and then knocking door down because they believe somebody's on the other side. And if no one is, then they'll just pay for get the door fixed because they were really confident that there was somebody on the other side. The thing is is that when you behave that way in the world, that extinction curve, that is determination.
(14:06) How many times can you continue to act without seeing the results of your action? That is determination. You want something and you will just continue to beg. And maybe it's you knock on the door, then you jiggle the handle, then you look through the window, then you go around back.
(14:18) Like there are so many people that off the first knock stop. And so I use the example of just knocking in again and again. But the reality is that you typically will knock multiple times, knock louder, shout, look through the window, go around back, call the phone, text, see if there's a find my friends, text their friend to see where they're at.
(14:36) Like there's how many doors will you go through or will you break down to get what you want. That is determination. Basically the goal doesn't change. How you get there you don't care about. You just care that you get there. And so that trait above all else and this is something that I have witnessed with beast and the few billionaire friends that I have and just what I've read from from Elon and you know Steve Jobs is like the unwillingness to shake from what they believe to be true.
(15:00) And so the thing is is that this isn't permission to act like a dick. But it is permission to say that if someone can't disprove why what you think is possible is possible, that you absolutely can hold on to that with white knuckles and say no, we will figure it out and you will tell me what obstacles are in the way and one by one we will dismantle them until all that is left is the goal.
(15:18) And so here's the tough reality that I had to realize and I used to repeat this self. Sometimes other people's dreams have to die in order for yours to live. And I remember having to say that to myself because all it is is that they have aspirations for my life. I'm never going to listen to someone whose aspirations for my life are smaller than my own.
(15:36) Like don't take advice from someone who has smaller dreams for you than you. And so the thing is is that my dad, believe it or not, because he had higher fear around risk. And so it wasn't out of mal inention. It wasn't out of malice. It wasn't because he didn't want me successful. He didn't want me to be a failure more than he wanted me to be a mega success.
(15:54) Because if you think about it from a parent's perspective, you are your parents biggest burden. I heard this in a little short the other day. I loved it. You are your parents biggest burden. You are the thing they worry about 24 hours a day all day long. And the thing they're worried about is that you're going to make it. And make it for them is just that you're productive member of society, that you're happy you could feed yourself.
(16:11) That's fundamentally what they want. They want you to have a good family. They want you to have something that you don't hate and that you can make money doing. That's it. That's to be fair, that's a high bar in some places. But the thing is is that your dreams for you might be higher. But if your dreams are higher, so too might be the risk you're willing to take.
(16:29) And so they have a different risk apparatus than you do. And it makes sense because for you it's like think about how how scared they are of you getting hurt of something bad happening to you. So it makes sense they act that way. It's not you doing something dumb. Now don't get me wrong, you might be doing something stupid, but the thing is is that the good news is like unless you die, you can still get back up and try again.
(16:46) And so for me, it took me realizing that the people who were telling me what I need to do with my life had smaller goals than me because if I told them what I really wanted, they'd be like, "Dude, get real." And so you might have that, too. Some people in your life may be like, "Be realistic." It's like, "I'm not trying to be realistic, man. I got one life. I'm going to die.
(17:03) " And here's the crazy part is that life is short, but youth is even shorter. And so, use it while you got it. So, number five, and this was this one's uncomfortable. Pain is a prerequisite to progress. So, I remember saying something about this a while back and I had a bunch of comments that I saw of people being like, "As soon as this guy said pain is progress, I was out." And I can already tell you I know that they're not going to be successful.
(17:27) And it's not that I'm saying that like I want you to go through pain. I don't think anyone wants someone to go through pain, but I think that you want someone to grow. And think about the reason they call them growing pains is because as soon as you stretch past your potential, as soon as you get into an area that you haven't done before, it's uncomfortable.
(17:46) And so to get the adaptation from the extra stress, you have to have the extra stress to get the adaptation. And so you can beat 99% of people without being smarter or luckier, but by being willing to endure pain and uncertainty. That's a big one, uncertainty for longer. because the fastest growth periods are often the most miserable. And so if you want progress, get used to pain.
(18:09) And I love this quote from Paul Graham. I referenced him earlier, but if you want to earn a million dollars, you have to endure a million dollars worth of pain. And so I said there was two kind of categories there. One is the actual pain. And the other is the uncertainty. But the thing is a lot of the pain comes from the uncertainty.
(18:26) Like what's interesting about this is they've done this little experiment with uh with mice and I remember reading about this and being like that makes so much sense. So, a mouse that gets dropped into water, right, will do its little mouse paddle, whatever, and then eventually drown after like however many, you know, minutes.
(18:44) If they took that mouse, drowned it, and then right before it was about to, you know, die, they uh pulled it back up, dried it off, and then put it back in, it went like 30 times longer. It wasn't even it wasn't like 20% longer, 50%, it was like 30 times longer. It stayed above because it knew there was a chance of survival.
(19:03) And so the first mouse who then gives up at the 30 minute mark rather than like the 60 hour mark or something insane is everyone because we don't know if we're going to make it until you make it. You don't you don't get the second you don't get the human or whatever who pulls you out and then puts you back in. You don't know that.
(19:22) And so you just have to have faith that if you keep paddling, if you keep your head above water, you'll eventually make it to where you're trying to go. And so it's the uncertainty that we have to battle. This is why there's like I do every once in a while make these types of videos because like it's the stuff between your ears. It's the beliefs you have about the world that ultimately allow you to persist and continue when things don't work.
(19:44) Cuz I want to be honest with you, like 2025 has been by far the hardest year of my well hardest year in the last eight years. Out of the last 13, it's my fifth worst. All right? But out of the last eight, it's a local minimum. It's the worst year I've had almost in the last decade. And I bring this up because so people have heard of hedonic adaptation, right? You get used to pleasure very quickly. What they don't talk about is that you also get used to pain. So you habituate. You get used to things quickly.
(20:02) So it actually does work on both sides. But here's the nasty part. The reason entrepreneurship and growth is so difficult is that you do not adapt to pain if the pain changes in intensity or variety. And so if you want to effectively punish someone, then you want to change the variety of punishment and the intensity of punishment.
(20:20) And so the thing is is that life is exceptional at doing that for you. And I love this saying um life doesn't fight fair and neither does business. And the thing is is that you have to fight regardless. You have to fight nonetheless. And you have to win. And that means that whatever whatever whatever software you have to install, whatever belief system you need to have, you do whatever it takes.
(20:38) And so, um, I wasn't planning on sharing this, but I'm going to I'm going to do it now cuz I think it's I think it's relevant. So, I just had a a friend of mine for a long time ago who came out to visit me. And he had started a business and it was in an industry that I know a lot about. And over that time period, he never once reached out to me for help or anything closing the business down.
(20:57) And so when he came out, I was like, "Dude, what the hell?" And he said, "If I was going to fail, I wanted it to be my own. I didn't want it to be I didn't want anyone else to kind of like have a part of that. I wanted to like I wanted to own the outcome regardless." And I was like like I heard that and I just thought to myself like what a terrible way to see the world cuz my perspective is entirely different than that.
(21:14) Mine is I want to win no matter what. And if I need to ask for help from a hundred different people, it doesn't matter how many people I help cuz it is my fault no matter what whether I win or not. And so it's also my responsibility to do everything in my power to win. And so I get no points from anyone by losing on my own. I get no points for doing it on my own because at the end of the day, you're never going to have done it on your own.
(21:33) You were born from somebody else. My dad came here came as an immigrant. So did my mother, right? Both my parents are first generation immigrants, not born here. So like everything I have is because of them. Okay? I'm also born in America. I'm a white guy. I've got good genetics. Whatever. Like there's a hundred things that are out of my control.
(21:50) But if you don't play every card you have, then what are you doing? And I'll tell you the story that my dad told me and it was actually like really impacted me. There was there was a period of time where I thought like I came out of academia so I had the the guilt right the guilt of privilege that they try and instill in you. What a handcuff by the way.
(22:08) Anyways so I told this nonsense to my father and he said to me do you think Shaquille O'Neal was like I can't play basketball. I'm 71. It's not fair to other people for me to play basketball cuz like this is like I'm have such an advantage. And he just looked at me. He's like play the cards you have. He's like, "You can't play basketball. You're not 71." He's like, "But you can do this, so do it.
(22:25) " Like, if you're good at something or you have some natural predisposition, by all by every means possible. Knock on every door. Bang the door down if you have to get the opportunities that you want to. Like, what's your downside? Shame. Shame is your downside.
(22:45) Someone wagging their finger at you saying you broke a rule that doesn't exist that I made up to make you feel bad. You're going to die and so are they. So get get what you want. So number six, success demands courage. So what's interesting is that I think Peter Thiel said this, or maybe I'm just making that up, courage is in far shorter supply than intelligence. And so a man with twice the courage and half the advantages will always beat a man with twice the advantages and half the courage. There it is.
(23:05) And Peter Seal said this, "Courage is in far shorter supply than genius." There's a lot of really smart people. There aren't a lot of very courageous people. And he's talked about this and I agree.
(23:18) There's an interesting, you know, observation you can make is like why are there so many kind of like autistic founders that build these big companies? And his thesis, which I agree with, is that many of them just miss social cues. And so, because they're less affected by the social criticism and social rules that other people choose to adhere to, even though it's entirely arbitrary and made up, they're able to operate in a world without those rules, a world that's significantly more of their own making.
(23:35) And so, that's the construct they choose to live in. And so right now you have likely the things that are causing you fear are rules you made up or rules that other people told you that you chose to believe. The way that you conquer those rules or at least the ways that helped me is playing it out.
(23:51) It's like okay like fear exists in the vague, not in the specific. So when someone says I'm going to be a failure, that's vague. What does that mean? It means that you tried something and didn't work. Is that what you mean? Well, because that happens all the time, right? It can't be that. No.
(24:07) What is it? Well, other people would know what that you tried something and it didn't work. Okay. Does that mean that you give up forever? Cuz that would make you a failure, not just trying again. Cuz if you kept trying again, would you still be a failure if you tried a second time? Well, I guess if I was still trying. Yeah, you're still trying. You're still trying.
(24:20) You're not a failure. You're still trying. Okay. Well, I What if I lost all my money? Well, guess what? 60% of America has no money. Welcome. 60% of America is like literally less than zero dollars. They literally have less money than they owe. But even so, does sleeping on your couch or living in a worse neighborhood or not having as good of a car, is that make you a failure? I think it like it's still way better than the vast majority of the rest of the world.
(24:42) And so, like in the Western or developed world, your worst case scenario is you get free housing and free food. That's your worst case scenario. I think the true downside is believing their lie and then living the rest of your life as a slave to someone else's dreams. Real quick, guys, I wrote these two books.
(24:59) one will help you make whatever the thing that you're selling is better so that you can get more people to buy it at way higher prices. And this one is about getting the world to find out about it, which is how do you get leads? And these together can help just about anyone get their business started or scale their business from wherever it is to significantly bigger.
(25:16) I've spent more time on these books than any piece of content by a mile. And I think in aggregate they have like 32,000 five stars on Amazon. And so if you want them, I'm sure there's a link somewhere and you can find them on Amazon, too. And if you're poor and don't have $20, you can go uh to acquisition.com/audiobooks and I'll send you the audio version of this free. Number seven, be okay with no one cheering for you. Think of it like this.
(25:34) No one cheers for you not drinking for a day or not smoking on a long drive or not overeing for one night. No single workout or meal is ever impressive on its own. The reason so few people understand success is consistency never looks impressive in the moment, only at the end.
(25:58) And so people only root for people who don't need it once you've already won. People are like, "He's amazing. He's so good." But like that's the last time you need it the least. And so you're all you always have to be the person who roots for you before everyone else does. And people struggle to do things alone because if everyone else were cheering you on, then it means that you're not in the right place.
(26:16) It means that you're just like everyone else and that's not where you want to be. You know, I'll tell I'll tell you a really interesting one that's more recent. So, when I was about a year and change out from selling gym launch, I wanted to have a second acquisition channel. So, we ran a lot of paid ads and I wanted to have another way to get customers.
(26:36) And so, I read this book on outbound and I was like, "Okay, we're going to do this outbound thing." And 90 days in, we had only done one sale. And I put all my attention towards this thing. And I remember the whole executive team like kind of like called me onto a Zoom call like an intervention, right? Like all these people were there and I was like, whoa, what's going on? And I was like, I mean, I own the company. I can't get fired.
(26:52) So, what's going on? Right? And so, they were like, hey, we need to talk to you. You're spending way too much time on this outbound thing. Like, your focus is needed elsewhere in the business. Let's do more of what works. This is a woman in the red dress. I was like trying to use my stuff against me.
(27:09) I remember that conversation so vividly because it had been 90 days and we only had one sale. I basically had almost nothing to show for my work, right? And I remember it so vividly because the scene that I recall was this moment in the movie Troy, Brad Pitt. It's an old movie and it's at the very beginning and Brad Pitt, who's Achilles, is going to go fight this giant right before he's about to, you know, fight the giant.
(27:27) There's this little boy, it might have been a squire or something who hands him a helmet or whatever. And he says, "He's huge. You know, I wouldn't want to fight him." And Achilles Brad Pit looks down at the boy and he says, "And that is why no one will remember your name." First off, savage.
(27:41) Second off, I remember thinking that because like it's normal to not want to keep moving when no one's cheering for you. Cuz the reality is that people only root for other people at two times. At the beginning when you start and at the end when you finish. The problem is neither is when you need it. So you have to master the middle, the boring, soulcrushing, unending, relentless middle.
(27:59) It's the step after step after step while you're running the marathon. Like the starting gun's exciting. It has balloons. Everyone's there with you and it's like I'm going to start this thing, right? And then there's nothing. there's just nothing for 26 miles. Just nothing. And then at the very end, you've got more balloons and more people. But that's where the winning happens. The winning happens on your own.
(28:17) So after that little intervention, I said, "No, we're going to double down on this because I think this is what's required for us to be able to sell this company." And over the next 9 months, we're able to get piece by piece by piece to get it to work until eventually outbound was 50% of our sales.
(28:35) And because of having two very different acquisition channels, it made the business significantly more stable and ultimately sellable. That decision to basically tell everybody, "Yeah, you're all wrong." Took honestly a lot of balls because I also felt bad. I was like, I want to look like I want to seem like I'm a listening leader. I want to seem like, you know, I'm taking everyone's, you know, ideas into consideration. And when every single person who's in leadership in the in the business is like, you need to stop doing this. You need to keep doing what works.
(28:53) I was like, you're all wrong. I'm going to keep doing this cuz I know it's the right thing. And so sometimes you have to do that. And this is one of my favorite memes ever. Can you pull up that meme that has the It's like, yes, you're all wrong. It's like one of my favorite memes. It's like here's a meme and I probably love this meme. It's probably my single favorite.
(29:10) It's not really even a meme, I guess. I mean, I just think it's a visual, but like I think about this one a lot is that sometimes you just have to be that guy and be like, "Yeah, you're all wrong." Number eight, hold yourself to a higher standard. Now, this is different from raising your standards in terms of what you believe is possible.
(29:27) This is taking that same idea and applying it only to yourself. So, the first example I talk about is the universe. is like what do I believe is possible in the universe versus what I believe is possible about my behavior and I think the world has gotten incredibly soft especially in the west and so self-love if there is such a thing isn't a wine and spa day it's holding yourself to a higher standard than anyone else does I think self- loveve is doing whatever you can to bridge the gap between who you currently are and who you believe you can become and so the voice inside of your head that's never satisfied with your achievements isn't your insecurity it's
(29:58) the part of you that knows that you can do more. So don't listen to people who are like ignore that that little voice. It's like no that little voice is knocking on your head being like dude you can do better than this. Like we don't have to accept this reality like we can be more.
(30:15) And so if you think about how how humans learn things, right? The primary way of learning is through modeling. We see other people do things, right? And then we do them, right? We actually get feedback from from doing it ourselves. And so if you want within an organization to inspire everyone else to go to a higher standard, then you have to hold it yourself. And I would say that I'll give you two very tactical examples.
(30:34) So Leila had this realization that she wanted everyone in the company to dress up more. She said she saw people who were showing up on Zooms like they just got, you know, got out of a bomb shelter. I mean, who knows? Whatever. And she she was like, "Man, these, you know, these these people just look like they're just rolled out of bed.
(30:51) " And then she looked at herself in the mirror and she was like, "Well, I'm kind of just like wearing sweats and have no makeup on and like all this stuff." And so she started dressing up and like putting makeup on and just like, you know, looking presentable. And all of a sudden, she didn't even say anything. The rest of the company started doing it, too.
(31:08) And if you're curious, how do they deal with how I dress? She lets everybody know that this is actually a uniform for me. And so I am in uniform. It's just my uniform is different than theirs. Just FYI. So the second example is that at acquisition.com, I would say just about everyone works six days and probably half the company works seven days a week.
(31:25) Now, anyone who hears that, of course, all the super soft people, you're fine. You can comment there if you want to, but we're trying to win. And so, the reality is the people who are on the other side of the globe who are fighting to beat you are happy to work 7 days a week. No problem. Also, 7-day work week completely manufactured as of like the 19 like 40s, right? Like, this is a a new human concept.
(31:43) This isn't like, oh my god, how are these people surviving? This like you're going to be okay. Now, let me tell my story now that we've diffused the the the weakness bomb. Many people work that way. Why? I work and Leila work. And so if you want to see a certain behavior exist within your company or your surroundings, best way to get that to happen is to model it yourself. And so this is just as true with an organization or it is with a team or even as it is with you and a spouse.
(32:05) Like if if I want Leila to start doing something, one of the easiest things is just start doing it for her. And the nice thing is that you don't even have to have the conversation. It just starts happen. And then as soon as it happens, reward, reinforce the behavior. Yeah.
(32:17) And some of you guys have seen me write this little in a bunch of places. And uh I talk about being one of zero. So I'll tell you where that came from. So at the book launch two years ago, one of our things when we were building out my you know brand was one of one content which is like only make stuff that we can make, right? Don't make stuff anyone else can make. And we kept that.
(32:39) And as we approached the launch, you know, it got cooler and cooler and we were like we're going to give away even and then eventually was like we're going to give away it all, right? And so believe it or not, the giving away at all was like a surprise that like half my team didn't know about either at the launch. So it was like actually super fun for me in the background.
(32:50) But when that happened and everyone went nuts for it, they were like, "Dude, that wasn't even one of one. It was one of zero." It wasn't just doing what only you can do. It was doing things that you didn't know you could do yet. Doing things that you didn't know were possible, but you believe are within your potential. And that's why I love one of zero so much is that like I want to live a one of zero life.
(33:07) Not a life that only I can live, but a life that best version of me that can do things that I can't do yet. I want to live what that man would live. And so that is why I think it's so key to be able to hold yourself to a higher stand and be able to do that for a long and enduring basis because it's the only way that you're going to achieve what you ultimately want or at least what you're capable of. Now, let's talk about reality.
(33:26) Number nine, accept hard tradeoffs. There is no perfect way to live your 20s. You either live them up and become an underskilled 30-year-old or you work them up and become an underlived 30-year-old. You just have to figure out which you'd rather be, accept the trade-offs, and know that there are no doovers.
(33:43) So, in my experience, I've met far more people who were dissatisfied with their live at Up 20s than those who regretted their work at Up 20s. Because in your 20s, most of the time, you don't really know what you want. But what you need to do to grow and move forward is usually pretty straightforward.
(34:01) So, you take the known path and along the way, you gain perspective on what actually matters to you. And often you realize that there are far fewer things that truly matter than you originally thought because living it up in your 20s might have just been chasing your mom's dream or your friend's dreams only to wake up in your 30s and realize you didn't live it up at all and you didn't work it up either and now you have neither.
(34:18) And here's another hard truth about this. What you believe is going to be your live it up in your 20s, your 40-year-old self doesn't value any of that. But your 40-year-old self absolutely will value the skills that you acquired in your 20s. because the skills will stay with you and will compound with time. But I want to be clear. I don't say you should or shouldn't do anything.
(34:37) You can do whatever you want. This is just one man's two cents if you're dissatisfied with your current. But I remember there was this moment when I had six gyms and I knew what I was going to do to get to 10 locations. I ended up flipping the model and doing something else.
(34:50) But when I realized what it would take to go from 6 to 10, I remember I made this video where I publicly basically was just like, "Hey, I'm working a lot right now." and I was working basically like 612s and I still kind of like took Sundays and I used to watch the Ravens and I looked at what little time I had left in my week and I was like well am I willing to give up the Ravens which is a football team for those of you guys who aren't in the US and you know fantasy and you know Netflix series that I watch am I willing to give up that to get to 10 locations and I was like yeah I'm willing to give that up for 10 locations
(35:20) and so I made the trade. Some of you aren't willing to give up wreck dodgeball or, you know, beers with the boys. And I don't think like if if you're not, great. Just make sure that you're doing it for the trade-off that you know you're actively making, right? If you're doing it by default, right? If you're watching your TV series, then you really are like, "No, I would prefer to have this TV series than Michael, then dude, more power to you." The thing is is that most people make unconscious traits. They accept the trade-offs. So once you've accepted the trade-offs, the
(35:44) next one is you have to be willing to look like an idiot. You just have to be willing to look like an idiot while you figure it out. Because once you figure it out, everyone else looks like an idiot for doubting you. The easiest way to lose in life is to avoid looking bad. So Sam Alman had this little blog post that he made about the power of being misunderstood, but he basically posited that you should trade being short-term low status for being long-term high status, which most people seem unwilling to do. And a common way that this ends up happening is by eventually being
(36:16) right about an important thing that most people don't agree on. But the key thing is that fundamentally you see something other people don't see and they don't believe what you see and so they bet against you. And all asymmetric returns in life come from betting against conventional wisdom. But conventional wisdom is usually right.
(36:33) And so you have to be willing to bet big. And the thing that's unproven is you. And so of course it makes sense for them to bet against you because conventionally they'll be right. But you're n equals 1 and you have a much longer history with you than they do.
(36:51) And so you actually have an asymmetric information advantage against everybody who bets against you is that you know you more than they do. And so you know that if you say you're going all in, you're going all in because opportunity only looks like opportunity looking backwards. Today it looks like risk. So a couple final thoughts. When losers go through hard, they think poor me.
(37:09) When champions go through hard, they think poor everyone else is going to try and catch me because they're going to have to go through this too and they're not going to make it. And so despite all the hard that you're going through, you just have to believe with all your heart that you're going to make it. Because the thing is, as long as you keep trying, you are making it.
(37:27) And one of the things that I've learned about success to the degree that I can even say this is that you become successful the moment you decide you are. Because there's always going to be another goalpost. And the thing is is that your current self today is living a life that your past self once dreamed of. You've accomplished goals that you said would make you happy. You've accomplished things that you said would make you successful.
(37:44) And so success is very much in the eye of the beholder, including your own. And so that means that you can both be successful and be dissatisfied. They don't have to be mutually exclusive. And I think that's okay.

Transcript:
(00:00) this is Cody he runs a custom Trophy and Plax business doing $1.7 million per year it's a family business that's been passed down for four generations but the business only makes 6.4% profit barely $100,000 and after taxes it's even less so if Cody wants to pass this down to his kids one day they're not going to inherit a thriving business just a low-paying job with long hours and a lot of risk I'm alosi I own acquisition. comom a portfolio of companies that generates hundreds of millions a year and I also sold and built a physical
(00:26) Products company so I'm very familiar with some of the problems that Cody's dealing with my suspicion is that key things that are going to Catal his business are fixing his pricing scaling his advertising and figuring out how to generate repeat business from his existing customers and so first I'm going to dive deep into the business then we're going to break down all the tactics that he and you can use to scale your business what's up how you doing let's talk about trophies yeah so my name's Cody Cody schulson I own trophy
(00:50) Outlet well last year we did about $1.72 million in Revenue mainly trophies and awards personalization uh about $110,000 in profit 6.4 % net margin um and I'm third generation owner of the company we've been in business for almost 40 years so that's amazing so when I saw his low profit margins I immediately think is it a per unit thing that he doesn't have good economics on which could indicate a pricing issue or he just need to sell way more volume based on his fixed cost and so anyways I needed to dig to find out more so what's
(01:18) the uh yeah what's the goal the goal is 3.5 million in Revenue I really want to d double uh Revenue the reason this goal is so important to me is it's it's a legacy to me if I can create a business that's profitable and can sustain itself that's a fourth generation maybe fifth generation business so who do you help so mainly coaches um event organizers as well as businesses and organizations as well as gag gift uh purchasers I got that Vibe yeah okay so how do you help them uh so we offer free engraving uh fast shipping everything we do is personalize to the business or the
(01:48) individual they go to the website to our platform purchase you know add the personalization info the logo things like that and then we fulfill it if it's a needs approval anything like that but most things ship in one to two days sweet how do you make money how do we make money all right so um on our website Direct on our website most of our products kind of land in that1 $150 price point uh we have products that range from $4 all the way up to $900 so it's a wide range uh most popular item is a$ five and 6ot trophy which kind of lands about $89 to $130 okay and then
(02:21) Dash plaques which are like little car show things that guys collect when they go to car shows and oh interesting yeah so it's kind of we sell them for $125 um we minimum 50 but we sell thousands of them I've never even heard of that so how do you get customers trophy Al started in 1985 you know this is our 40th year and uh we launched our Etsy uh business in 2019 we did about $70,000 the first year and then in 2013 or 2023 we launched Amazon and did about $300,000 and then last year we launched Tik Tock shop and we did about $270,000
(02:52) in Revenue but 250 of that came in December alone uh so we had a video go viral with 20 plus million views that's awesome uh so went crazy so 250 of that came in in one month so that was kind of fun you guys are blowing these up on the Tik Tock shop and since I'm in charge I got to be here today to make sure these all get shipped out if you can keep it going maybe next week I'll make the come in and they can take care of it have a good Sunday and you sold those we sold those yeah and not quite family appropriate but yeah no I love that and you were able to fulfill on the amount
(03:22) of orders that came in yeah yeah we did about 13,000 of those so do you have inact set up like you yeah we produce everything in house so we engrave C all ship it so what I found really interesting about these gifts is they're very sharable both in that like they're funny and you could share like a video about it on social media but also because whenever you gift you literally send a product to somebody else and so I'm trying to think through you know are there ways that we can harness that or at least lubricate that process so we can get more shares more referrals more return customers across four different
(03:51) channels uh most of our clients come through uh online and internal is through SEO and Facebook ads we just launched Facebook ads and meta about October November with an agency yeah and then Amazon we spend about $7,100 a month between agency and ads and then Etsy and then Tik Tok still kind of figuring that one out a little bit since it all happened in December but about $2,000 so far got in ads there so the channels get super overwhelming because we're spending so much money on ads and agencies and what's working what's not working you know so just getting Clarity from Alex on that piece alone is super
(04:23) helpful well how many customers have you have you sold so far in 2024 uh Direct on our website and I have this broken work out per channel in a couple slides but total visits is about 990,000 visits to our site about 2500 orders just a 2.
(04:43) 8% conversion rate and about 781 products so it's a lot of products is everything everything made to order yeah everything so it's not so it's not like you're carrying a ton of inventory like you got raw raw materials in raw materials most of it we bring in from our vendors kind of as we need it we don't car a huge huge so when I asked is it made to order that was an important question because inventory can be one of the biggest costs in a business and especially with somebody that had that many ex skes I got really worried about it but because it's made to order then it's really just like optionality so then you just look at operational efficiency of like how difficult it is
(05:08) to make all these different things and I bring this just from my own physical products appearance with Prestige Labs which is my supplement company you know you you've got to be looking out you know 8 weeks 12 weeks sometimes 16 weeks ahead of time to make your orders and that can be a huge cash drag on the business what's been holding you back so I think it's marketing um fulfillment wise we proved that in December we can handle about double fulfillment I mean with limited complexity so um so I just
(05:32) need more people to the site more people buying and we can fulfill it so and also very product heavy with low margins so working on the margin piece uh getting profits up a little bit so do you want to like sell this company eventually or like what's the haven't really had any thoughts of selling but I want to create a business that is sellable yeah so I have the option if I want to sell or but I would love for it to be a fourth generation business someday all right so how many locations do you have because
(05:55) you have brick and mortar correct uh we have one retail location now uh we have two locations total uh we closed the other retail location down it is production only facility okay so the other retail location um you know does maybe $150,000 in Revenue out of that location so just like walk-in traffic and whatever yeah Walkin email stuff does it break even not really okay so we're kind so you have a manufacturing facility in one retail yeah which also does some manufacturing as well yeah is there any downside to just like consolidating to the one it's something that we're actually looking at and going
(06:26) more e-commerce and kind of cutting the yeah the retail business the fact that he has two physical locations is a bit odd given the nature of retail in 2025 the vast majority you know and it's continuing to grow as people are doing online sales and especially with the amount of customization that he offers it makes more and more sense for him to sell to a national base which he's already doing so these are the issues what are the metrics you got so numbers 1.
(06:52) 72 million in Revenue about 110,000 in profit 40% gross margin I would have expected gross margins to be higher for this business and it varies per product tons of you know like certain I was like expecting like you know one like you buy these trophies and they're like you know a dollar and you're like there's no like this is made of rubber you know like okay so it it varies widely between the products and platform and stuff like that but uh yeah net margin about 6.
(07:20) 4% uh LTV 133 and then CAC 1190 LTV to CAC ratio 11 to1 and that's Blended across all channels how do you come up with pricing guessing for the most part or I'll look at some competitors but um there's not really good Apples to Apples comparison necessarily do you do like a Cost Plus or like yeah so I have massive spreadsheets of all of our cost you know things like that factor in labor and then I just kind of add my margins to it and you know have slowly been trying to bring that up over the years yeah when Alex is pointing out the margins and they're really low and I agree I just
(07:48) don't quite know what to do yet and but it's a problem we've been looking to solve for quite a while what percentage of customers are are new versus return I don't have a percentage for that gut gut I would say probably just on our website and internal customers probably 5050 okay because this four-year-old business so You' think there'd be a decent amount of return yeah a lot of our business I mean $530 in Revenue comes just internal so emails calls things like that most of that is re is is repeat business the
(08:20) fact that he's getting $500,000 per year in return customers I'm going to be poking on that to see if there's any unmissed opportunities there that we can squeeze the hell out of that and maybe double triple that if we do it on purpose rather than on accident do you have very high fixed costs in this business not too bad no cuz if you have half the business comes in from word of mouth I would expect the margins to be higher like the net margins think this is big hypothetical it's like if we got rid of all of the new customers right and we just sold the 500 and something
(08:50) thousand from Return customers that should be free customer acquisition and then we should make money right but looking at this I'd be like I don't know if we would make money and real quick for those of you who are new fixed costs are basically costs that stay in the business independent of how much you sell so rent is a fixed cost some kinds of Labor fixed cost your internet connections fixed cost these are things you have to pay every single month variable costs are cost as a result of sales so if I sell more
(09:16) products I have more cost of goods right I have more maybe labor in in creating those products the costs basically work by their name they're fixed or they're variable yeah our cogs are pretty high I do think there's a pricing issue yeah which we'll get too okay but okay this is good your LTV to cac's pretty strong yeah it's it's pretty decent and I learned that a few months ago coming here the first time so I started increasing and that has that's not lifetime Revenue that's lifetime that's gross profit that's profit yeah okay yeah interesting so what I'm zering in on is is there a pricing issue and to
(09:46) what extent is there one because this is a great limus test because if you get free sales which return customers are free sales it cost you nothing somebody else tells them about it and then they come in right you should be the most profitable on those customers and so if that that level of volume you're still not profitable you either have high fixed costs which I asked him in the beginning or we might Dingle lingle Ling have a pricing issue it's 40-year-old business who was in charge of pricing that whole time like you took it over from your old I guess he took it from
(10:11) his old man so like your third generation so my yeah my parents ran the company they didn't have a price structure they just kind of yeah you know and on an annual basis do you review all prices every year y interesting so about February March of every year is when our vendors raise prices so then I adjust accordingly got it was their margins the same when they were running it uh much less lower oh way low like not making money at all so my mom was running it I remember very distinctly looking at a product and the cogs on that were like $50 and we were
(10:42) selling it for like 45 I mean this does not work yeah so I immediately raised prices like you know doubled them almost and constantly just continually up them yeah I think I have some ideas there all right what else you got Channel breakdown so direct traffic and internal is our you know biggest um 13 to1 LTB to CAC ratio Amazon our highest conversion rate at 99.
(11:07) 6% conversion and of course the the Blended 11 to1 LTV to CAC so interesting and so you don't have LTV metrics on Tik Tok no couldn't quite figure that out yet okay um the easiest way to do it is just go uh total revenue divided by total number of customers okay so you did 262 do you know how many customers you sold on think about almost 13,000 Michael 262 divided by 13,000 says 262 13 20 Yeah clean okay so 20 bucks that sound about right average yeah well that's the average order value right so we we just don't know how many times they've purchased right which is
(11:40) one as of this point you know MH so aov is typically used in e-commerce uh or retail which is average order value he's saying that he has a low average order value on Tik Tok but it's very different for different customers or on different channels and so it's valuable to understand what the aov is by customer and by Channel now this is a little bit of data but at the end of the day if you want to win you got to know your numbers if we're thinking about the business zooming all the way out we have the cost of getting a customer and then we have
(12:05) what customers are worth and the first transaction you get is going to be the average card right the first transaction but then after that you want repeat purchases as well and so I'm going to probably be pruning into like okay how many people buy again or is it a onetime purchase and things like that so little bonus for you so I've been following your content for quite a while and you know obviously you have the caves of God so here's the C goat goat greatest of all time so I wish is it a cow is it a cow a oh it's a
(12:38) it's a goat for a second I thought cuz it could have been a cat like a calf like a little baby cow I could have done that too I didn't think this is great yeah this is one of our top selling products actually is it really goat trophy oh that makes sense that makes sense it's you trendy well thank you so much I appreciate it I will put it on my desk and I will show Ila just remind her of my calf Excellence yeah so we actually have a gift for ilila also which is in the back oh is it is it for me to give to her so I can get some husband points you get some husband points you love this oh she'll love
(13:08) this this is great she'll love this I love these These are really good yeah so you want a double Revenue yep got it what's this I hear about you wanting to buy another business yeah so I had a business reach out to me that's in the same industry in the St Louis Market that we're already in so um he's getting old wants to retire so and what's he doing in revenue and profit he does about double what we do about 3 million in Revenue don't know profits yet or anything we haven't even got to that point yet um but he's got a from what I
(13:37) understand he he does pretty decent on his margins he does a lot more custom stuff so which there's a lot higher margin on some of that stuff the biggest concern with him is 70% of his Revenue comes through one customer yeah so that's a pretty big uh pry buy that wouldn't buy that M gotcha I would try and find out if I could who the vendors were that he has in China for his connections for his raw materials yeah so that I could try and use those vendors yeah that was actually one resource I thought was well if I could buy this then it's cheap enough it's monstrous customer risk and it's
(14:06) especially if you have somebody retiring that one customer might be so at acquisition. comom we have a scorecard called the value acceleration method which essentially how can you both maximize value and then also minimize risk which ultimately makes a company more valuable in this one he says there's two big red flags here first is you've got keyman risk which is when you have a small business you got an owner that's retiring often times they are key man in the business now they've been working for however many years and there's so many things that they're unconsciously competent of and unconsciously are doing to keep the the
(14:35) wheels going and it's often not documented or at least well documented so that's a big concern number one but by far the biggest concern number two is that 70% of the revenue is coming from One customer so if that customer leaves because maybe the guy retires and he has a relationship with them then I'm so out right on this deal now the third thing here is we have to answer the question why bother right like why are we even doing this what problem are we solving now he did did bring up that this guy has some better connections for raw materials which can improve his margins which I do think is valuable but do I
(15:04) want to buy a business to get a connection I'll zoom out from the from back forward which is like what do we want to be when we grow up basically this is going to become a media marketing business that monetizes through trophies right or you can go the B2B Wholesale route which is probably like outbound sales team that's calling wholesalers and whatnot yeah from what it sounds like it sounds like you're better suited for the Ecommerce director consumer side that's what it sounds like I don't like currently that's where we're at yeah CU I think you get more than double sale currently um and it's
(15:38) just easier but that just kind of came naturally it wasn't anything we pursued necessarily but yeah majority of it's all e-commerce and okay you might have one of the simpler plans um that I have yeah uh yeah which is I I mean simple doesn't mean bad uh simple as good you know sometimes you have like 10 things to do it's better to have three that move the needle a lot and I think you're kind of in that situation there's three big things but I think we'll um we want you come over here and then we'll we'll we we'll net it out so Cody is actually at stage five product ties in the $100
(16:09) million scaling road map so if you look at marketing he needs to spend more on Niche down marketing and so the issue here is that he's he has two different avatars and we have to get him to pick pick and commit the nice thing is that I can probably tell you what the other problems he's going to be having at this level are and what he needs to do to graduate to get to the next level we broke down the stages of scaling a business into 10 steps and we did it across all eight functions of the business so product marketing sales customer service it recruiting finance and HR and the nice thing is that
(16:36) businesses behaven patterns and so if you want to know where you're at and what you need to do to get the next level this scaling road map is absolutely free and it comes personalized to you so we built this bot you plug in your business information and we'll send it right over to you now if you like the interaction that I'm having with Cod and you're like man I would love it if acis.
(16:55) com would take a look at my business and see if they could help me kind of move the pieces around and make it significally more valuable we run scaling workshops under our advisory practice throughout the year and if you want that on the thank you page you can schedule a call talk to my team and see if it's a fit otherwise get the scaling road map it's absolutely free and enjoy the rest of the video what percentage of customers are gag gifts so that's the Amazon Etsy Tik Tok Tik Tok that's all that so that's like what's that 4% yeah roughly and that's kind of been the fastest growing since
(17:24) 2019 that's when we launched that which is all under a different brand technically okay um we started a different brand back thing cuz we're we don't want the explicit vulgar to be under trophy outet you know Church moms and stuff get see I hear you with this business like fundamentally you just have it's youve traffic in a conversion page like and then if you already have let's call it for right now not a constraint on manufacturing or anything like that the three big kind of levers that I want to go off of is number one is consolidation which instantly heads
(17:56) to profit yeah pricing which also instantly adds to profit absolutely and then media these are the big ones okay so from a consolidation perspective we have the SKS right and then we also have the brick and mortar locations and then we kind of have like model so like in terms of like how I'm thinking through this so from a SKS perspective if you're not carrying them like normally I'd be like we need to massively cut down on SKS but like if you're not if you don't have like this Warehouse full of stuff and it's just like more options for people to purchase I don't think we need to like get rid of
(18:29) anything and a lot of the excuse too it's the same product just maybe for football versus baseball or something you know it's a very similar product right it's a it's a goat Trophy and you just put a different plaque on it kind of thing that doesn't bug me and if you were like man this it's super hard for my team to to build all these different things and I'd be like all right well then we should we should look at that but if it it doesn't seem like you're stressed on the manufacturing side no but that's where my skill set lies too as far as operations that's what I'm
(18:54) good at so the second is the brick and morner if you have this retail location and it's basically breaking even or Los money and that's not even the future of the business then to me I would say let's just save our 50,000 a year in rent and then just add that to the bottom line right I feel like that would be a good idea CU that would increase profit by 50% yeah just like chill pretty much instantly yeah and also there's just like the headache of like it's this thing over here yeah and youve got and you can probably just take the
(19:18) couple good people from there bring them to bring them home right you know yeah so that feels good so the next one is model this is arguably the most important decision that he has to make if in this entire kind of interaction with me because this is the strategy or the vision of the business like what kind of business do you want to be when you grow up and I think a lot of entrepreneurs get stuck in no man's land and they just can't decide and so if you think about what the definition of decide is it actually comes from Latin which is decader which means to cut off and which means we have to figure out
(19:47) what path we're going to cut off by making a decision but like if you wanted to have an exit of some kind then the revenue retention is going to be a really important thing if he just wants to make money and grow then it would probably be faster for him to just the consumer route and simply Arbitrage media and make the spread which tons of people are doing right now and I think would totally work for him but what won't work is trying to pursue both Masters and ultimately serve neither so in some ways you have two businesses let alone like if you were like forget about the third one you're thinking about buying like you already have two and I'd
(20:17) rather have one I'm not saying cut the one that you have it's obviously a 40-year-old business but like I really have to make that decision and and that that's actually not a me decision it's a you decision so if I'll say it the way that I think Le Lea loves framing opportunities this way because I always think about upside and she always thinks about downside and so it's like what what problem would you rather solve so in the gag gift path the problem that you're going to have to solve is you're always going to have to find new cheap forms of media okay so it's going to be
(20:43) like Tik Tok shop is what it is today and live shopping and that'll probably be good for another year or two and then it's like that'll start to get more expensive and other people compete and it's like then you're going to be in in the next whatever the next game is and you're just going to have to get really good at PID ads and creative and conversion optimization on the site increasing average order that kind of stuff the other path is you build either an outbound sales team so that they can sell these these kind of B2B offerings that are you know or B Toc if you want to consider the fantasy leaks and or
(21:13) just like a meta just like a simple meta ad strategy that would lead people to call the number functionally okay and then there you're saying cool our goal is to be your Dy provider for life um and I think the fact that your 4-year-old business sounds really good it's like hey we're 4-year-old business our goal is to be your manufacturer for life and so of course we're going to do this one but if you want we'll also give you 20% off next year um if you make the order now or I don't know I I I play around with that but which of the two paths sounds like the the life you want to live that's gosh that's tough only
(21:45) because media for me has always been a a hurdle not something I'm overly great at do you like it okay fair I will do it I'm happy to do it if it makes money of course you know okay um but I don't know that I love it per se this is a tough one yeah I'm trying to think what you know cuz you could cuz like if you wanted to hit 3 million next year I was like we could do 10 million next year I would just say we're going to take all of our resources we're going to go all in on Tik Tok viral organic and you're going to deploy everything into Tik Tok shop and get influencers to
(22:17) do lives for you showing all these funny gag gifts cuz like the the trophies are so built for sharability yeah like and so that's I mean 20 million views is a monster video but I'll bet you you could probably get you probably crack off a million videos all the time with these types of these types of we haven't figured that out yet but you know it all just I think happened if that was all you focused on you would be able to figure out because these are funny right and I think having like little skit
(22:41) scenarios uh where people you know walk in and they see the bosses thing or they they change their their uh their plate or you know someone loses and then it just say like Biggest Loser you know like that kind like the the negative versions we still need to make this decision though hearing you talk like going to here to 10 million I like that better even if I have to do like I'll get used to to videos and content you know the leagues thing is like that's like that's the that's the very stable version of this business and if you did ultimately want to sell in the future you being able to go to a potential
(23:12) buyer and saying like I have 5,000 leagues that buy our trophies from US every year and leagues on average stay for 12 years MH you know like guys who do fantasy or whatever it is it's like that's that's fairly you know that's a pretty that's a pretty reoccurring business you know that's a that's a that's a pretty good business yeah um harder to build though and slower much harder to build right that's also why it has more value so that's the so if if between those two paths the like I would like to just make more profit now and potentially scale faster then we can talk about the media version of this I think that's probably where I
(23:46) would okay cool you know I chose the Tik Tock route because of the scalability of it versus sticking on the the path we're on yeah it can become a big business but I look at the competitors that have been in the business for 40 years and that's a long road and a long life versus the scalability that I can then turn around and put people in place that I don't have to be there like that's more appealing to me than just just creating a big business so first things first is we're going to consolidate attention so
(24:15) we're going to shut down losing location so that should right off the bat be a plus 50% Improvement to profit yep which is great Cody cutting down that extra location is going to cost basically no Revenue because he's getting so little foot traffic that I'm not worried about the loss in sales cuz he's going to more than make up with that in two ways one he's going to have the $50,000 a month cost basically drop straight to the bottom line and for his business given the low margins he has that's significant the second thing is that
(24:45) he's going to consolidate his attention so he can take the best people from there bring them to the you know bring him to home base you know get rid of the people that aren't necessarily as good or as I like to say release to free agency so they have better opportunities somewhere else and then this way he can kind of like make the Dream Team at at home base and really double down on what matters and I can't really emphasize this enough the amount of return you get on Focus as an entrepreneur is higher than any resource and fundamentally this
(25:07) is strategy it's prioritization and that means that if it's not a priority you don't do it the second thing pricing so what I want you to do is I want you to switch from and you're probably familiar with this so there's a lot of different pricing models but you have basically something called a Cost Plus model you look at your costs and then you add a margin in and whatever the problem is is every business I know that does a cost plus model doesn't make a lot of money and so you want to switch to Value based
(25:34) pricing which is purely based on what someone's willingness to pay is and that could be unlimited and it doesn't matter what your stuff costs cuz why do they care what it costs right basically like as your vendors increase their costs to you in some ways it shouldn't have any effect on the price of what you sell because the price of what you sell is completely divorced of that and based on what somebody's willing to pay got so in terms of how we can do this so a which seem a little bit less scary is I would consider this to sound crazy but like
(26:03) monthly like 5% price increases like just keep going okay and just keep going that is like path one yeah and the thing is is that every time you raise the price by 5% you double your profit or I'll say 6% if you want to be like hey I doubled my profit this month then the next month you can raise by 6% and then more than double because it's 6% times 6% right so that is that is one way the other way is that you just start um immedi split testing kind of like 8020 on your highest sales velocity items this is simple right this is simple to do you have to do any thinking you just add it and that's what it is
(26:39) this one will probably get you more profit faster it just takes a little bit more thought so you'll take those four 4 foot 5 foot 6ot trophies and just start like just keep bumping the price and just seeing what conversion rate looks like what what you're trying to optimize for is gross profit times unit sold and so if you think about it's like where's the sweet spot where I get the most amount of units sold at the highest gross profit often times it's it's higher than you think it is because we're I think a lot of entrepreneurs get
(27:07) stuck is like sales velocity goes down and then they get afraid but the thing is is that you will usually make more money before you make less money when sales velocity drops usually I'm referencing something called price elasticity meaning if we make the price go up how much do the sales go down in general when you raise a price fewer people buy but the question is buy how many so for example if I were to double the price of something and that might triple my margins or quadruple my margins and 25% fewer people buy I should absolutely do that even though
(27:38) fewer people ultimately say yes and so he's in one of these situations where he's selling barely enough to say profitable he's selling a decent amount of volume and so I'm just saying I wonder if there's a way that we can bump this price even by 6% would double his profit that's why I'm testing like how sensitive is this market now he did indicate that the customer that he decided he wasn't going to pursue which is the the the car show guys the B2B sales the people who are kind of not the gag gift thing those people are very
(28:03) sensitive and so it's like okay if they're the sensitive ones and we're going away from them are the ones that we going towards less sensitive and it seems like the answer is yes and to me that's a big profit opportunity in terms of C kadence for Price tests would you do it on the site more or do you think you would be doing it on the phone it'd be on the site okay yeah because that's where customers see the pricing even if they call or anything like that yeah I'll bet you right now cuz I don't know
(28:27) how many people like Buy is it a super price sensitive Market trophies yeah can especially with certain avatars like car show guys are cheap which ones car show guys car show I'll bet you what's interesting about this is that your recurring Revenue business is very price sensitive and your gag price your gag business is not is not at all right I mean it makes me lean more towards the the gag gift side anyways because it's like we can get customers for free and we have far more pricing power CU they're in the moment they think it's funny whether it's or
(28:59) it's $12 or $16 like I kind of just want to buy it yeah you know the difference between eight8 and 16 is monstrous right for the business so psych PR test and I would probably start with uh the gag okay gifs here and then I'll make three let me try one 6% on uh boring side boring trophies at the end of the day you shouldn't take anyone's advice including your own you should just take the customer's advice and the way the customer gives you advice is by running a test and just actually seeing will you
(29:32) buy it or not and the nice thing is if you raise the price and you go too high and you ultimately have people you know sales decrease then you can always lower it again not a big deal but not testing your price is the most expensive thing that you can do in a business from The Profit that you should be making but aren't now this is the major part is if your focus is going to be media and that's going to be the direction that you're going in was there an influencer or something who who made the video that had the the trophy in it no this is my
(29:58) oper oh you guys did it and it just happened crush it got tagged our product on Tik Tok shop got tagged and we sold 70 to 100 off of that and then we did a follow-up video and that's the one that had 16 million views okay so yeah it how many Tik toks you make in a month uh right now we're doing about uh one a day and we're trying to ramp that up to three a day okay the gifts that he has the gag gifts the head mofo in charge uh those types of gag gifts lend themselves really well to being shared and going viral and so him doubling down on all
(30:31) the different permutations of that as different Hooks and different organic content that makes complete sense and he should just do as much of it as you possibly can and for anyone who's listening to this is like okay he's going to go from 1 to three I want to just break a belief for you you can post a 100 times a day the platform is incentivized to distribute your content to as many people as possible to retain attention and so there's a lot of Mythology on all platforms of people who say don't post more than x times I think
(30:55) it absolutely just comes down to equality metric which is how many many times can you post good stuff but there's a an Instagram page that's in Bollywood that posts a hundred times a day and gets like 9 billion views and so the thing is is that not the same people are going to see every post and so right now when you make a post only one or two% of your audience likely see it and so if you make 10 more posts they might just show to other people in your audience that aren't the first people who saw it so the direct site traffic
(31:20) right now comes predominantly from SEO so talk me about that do you have an SEO firm or you good no it's an SEO firm agency how long youve been working with though this one about 8 months traditionally I've only I've always had pretty good success with SEO okay and we stopped SEO because the company wasn't previous company wasn't performing and we just let it go for several months and then hired another company and then when these guys came in and started going back up again what stops you from like doing more SEO or rather what stops that
(31:50) like if if you were to say Hey cuz I mean when I see you 13 to1 right I'm like that sounds interesting if you were to say hey I want you to give me like three client's worth of focus so that you can give me three times the backlinks and three times the Articles or whatever it is that they're tring out for you is there anything that's because if you get 13 to1 it's like we should spend as much as we possibly can on that and that's why I started meta is but it's different though right cuz it's Interruption based ads versus SEO or it's intent based do you think you go to the SEO agency and just say like how do
(32:20) you Max me out I could absolutely do that okay I would because it's also like these things are things that are not taking your time right right so the SEO was interesting to me because he had an Outsource agency that was handling the vast majority of it so it wasn't actually a big time drain for him and it had really good returns and so again allocational resources think about this way if you have a machine that you can put a dollar in and get $13 out what do you limit your dollars in with you don't
(32:43) you put as many dollars in as you possibly can which is why I asked the question like how do we do 10 times more of this so this is like media one is SEO max out and the SEO company wants me to do Google ads as well is that something you'd kind of throw into that mix okay mhm yeah especially like these are both intent based right yeah like at the very least you should own your own terms which is like all your names and der derivatives of your names like I've I've rarely seen anyone in any business just own their own terms and not make money off of it and so people like why I want
(33:16) to pay for a click I was going to get the thing is is like you're not always going to get the click and so having it there I'm like you're going to make the money like just you know what I mean but then the the the second version of that is you know Associated terms like the long key wordss now gag gifts 100% no one's like hey uh you know your moon follow the plan uh you know trophy right or whatever um you're probably not scroll on Facebook yeah like I'm really looking for yeah I've been looking for a
(33:39) goat calf uh trophy right okay so this is the like if if we're looking at this these are all what I would consider like black and white very low lift almost guaranteed to make you more money moves almost all of these will just make you more money this is 13 to1 this is probably going to be high return this double the profit this takes adds $50,000 to the bottom line the price that's for sure going to increase on the gag gifts so now we can talk about the the media side so we're going to go from 1 to three a
(34:09) day and I think that you should focus on Trends and memes cuz this is a gag gift brand so it's okay for you to just like be silly and ridiculous and so like there are so many memes Michael where do we find our like Tik Tock meme stuff just hire a 17-year-old um sit there and scroll yeah yeah and just be like what's like what's trending right now you know what I mean like if you're a little bit on the older side perhaps you're a millennial right and you have a graying beard and you're ultimately going to be taken out to Pastor in the next 5 years right and put to rest um as I am you
(34:42) have to get people who are younger than you who are in you know in the game of social media who know what's hot right now and can make contextually relevant or native media that ultimately gets way more shares way more views and then ultimately more conversion plus 1,000 Aura to Cody so what's interesting is that a lot of these um Tik Tok ones also do well on Instagram so you could repurpose there do you do you post on Instagram yeah okay yeah started yeah at least you're getting you you'll get a double you know you get double usage on that but yeah Tik Tok is like the perfect platform for
(35:11) you for thei GI like it makes complete sense to me they did 250,000 in a month and so when I the reason I said the 10 million is like okay well that happened on accident let's do it on purpose and if you can do 250 a month just from that it's like well there's 3 million yeah I think you getting really ridiculous with the volume will get you a lot better and I think this is one of those things that you should live close to okay like you like these things are all things that you can do probably the week you get
(35:34) back you know what I mean this one is going to be this is like the the big commitment of what's the bet we're making the bet we're making is that mastering Tik Tok live selling Etc is going to be the way it's definitely a new skill it's a little intimidating uh to know like okay this is where 80% of my time is going to go now for a new task that I've never done but very Innovative which I love Innovation I love thinking about like oh hey how can we be different than the industry and this is definitely different now the second part of kind of like Tik Tok Mastery is going to be um influencers
(36:05) okay and so what's nice with Tik Tok shop is that your stuff is automatically to be listed there and other people can uh make videos for it and you're in the price point that's perfect for Tik Tok shop like 20 30 50 like it crushes for that stuff and it's it's such easy videos for people to make right and that lines up with what Tik Tok has been telling us too wait have you been reaching out to them or we have an account rep now oh cool great well I guess you did 250 so yeah but yeah Affiliates they said hit Affiliates hard
(36:35) T and I mean fundamentally like these are basically onetime work mhm this is the only ongoing work that you do Trends and memes and I'd be posting one to three times a day there repurpose on on IG right that's that's just free traffic and then the influencers will also kind of this will it'll be like a loop here so it's like they'll do something something that works well and then that will feed like it'll just be this nice Loop where they're also creating content for you okay real quick this type of
(37:06) content I've gotten a ton of positive feedback on and so I'm going to continue to make it but what I need your help on is helping it distribute because this isn't wide algorithm stuff a lot of people aren't going to see it because it's narrower and it is for business owners so if you know a business owner or you have kids and you want them to learn business where if people were business interested it would mean the world to me and my team who put so many hours into making this stuff for for you it would just mean the world if you send
(37:29) it to them it would mean a lot and then I'll put I'm going to put number seven on here because I think this is worth it the Tik Tok ads which you said you just started basically the the process is going to look like this you make the ad right or sorry you make the content you're making content right you're making Tik Tok content that Tik Tok content you know 10% go viral whatever and then 90% flop right then this you put ad money behind it you send this to influencers and say make stuff like this because this is what's converting and then they'll make
(38:09) versions of this that'll also inform your content which you'll then try to make iterations of what they're doing and so like you're kind of your Source like you're starting here's the Tik Tok content some does well great push ads behind it by the way guys here's the ones that are working well they make stuff you can take theirs push money behind it as well and model it and make for permutations of it gotcha and so for this stuff I would be kind of hook Centric meaning for well for most short for platforms like the hook is everything and once you have a winning
(38:39) hook I would like reuse reuse it over and over again the reason I'm recommending he doubled down on Tik Tok is you want to go where the fish are right you want to go where where the getting is good and so right now Tik Tok shop is crushing it it's blowing up lots of people are doing very very well on the platform and he already has seen some success and and so as soon as I get that little inkling of success there's that little blood in the water that's when I want to just like go go ham on it so one is how do we increase
(39:05) volume secondarily how do we increase quality of output basically once we do these easy fixes this is really the long-term strategy that he needs to get really good at is that he's got to get really good at media you actually have a really simple one the nice thing is that I have a lot of confidence in your like there's there's basically no like I'm not really sure like site price test could easily like 2x profit like on its own because the are so slim right now right uh 6X this is a 2x on profit for sure SEO max out right now it's 50% of
(39:35) Revenue is coming from that so it's like maybe we get a 50% Boost from them doing a better job on it PPC will just get you good returns this might give you like a 10 to 20% boost so I don't think going to be huge but it's like it's free and it's a onetime setup so it's not hard to do Tik tok's going to be the big lever of like how do we go from 1 million to 10 million it's like if you if you did nothing else but just say like a year from now if all we did was Master Tik Tok and Tik Tok shopping MH we would win like if you did nothing this is just
(40:06) going to take all of your existing business and make it more profitable so that you can take all of this cash and and float into here but actually fairly straightforward that's a good thing that's a good thing rather than like we have to bet the farm on something which sometimes has to happen yeah that's awesome way simpler than I was thinking so oh good yeah dud just do more of what works right and the fact that you have such low margins excites me because when you make five or 10% improvements you double or triple profit right and the fact that you haven't like that there
(40:34) was no pricing um discipline like there's no there's no like process to pricing besides like we'll just keep raising it when our cost go up usually there's just like when I see a business like that there's like massive unlocks like I'm saying 6% on boring trophies but like you might be able to push 25 yeah and that 4X is 5X is profit right whenever I see a business that's mispriced or extremely mispriced I get really excited because I know it's one of the lowest operational drag moves that you can do functionally everything else you have to do in a business you got to do something with pricing you
(41:05) literally change a number or you say a different word at the end of a phone call like it's that easy to change but it has such a dramatic impact on how profitable a business is and what's crazy about that is that entrepreneurs tend to be the most afraid of pricing changes so it's all between your ears and psychology and fear Just Having the courage to just say a bigger number the fear is that you're somehow going to lose your business you just if it doesn't work you just lower it back again not a big deal but this could change his life and so I'm very
(41:29) interested to find out more there what's the offer that you have in the Box usually it's a little code that says like 10% or something to order here order again why don't you give something much better than that okay so we have to come up with a really compelling offer to get people who are buying the nice thing the important thing is are you doing fulfillment for Amazon sales uh we have some FBA but most of it's fbm so we're fulfilling most of it okay great so you're fulfilling most of it that's wonderful okay so and Etsy same thing
(41:57) Etsy fill everything yeah great okay so that means that we can put something in the Box to be really compelling to get them to to buy something so if now Amazon and Etsy the purchasers who are buying there are they more bread and butter people or are they more gag people I would say more gag more gag okay because they're more like funny death signs funny saying stuff like that or jok I would put a bugo offer in or a so buy one get one to two free okay and then just fix the pricing of the one so that it makes sense I would basically have this little thing here so that
(42:36) would be the headline on the top of my little my little my little doad yeah you got your QR code and then I would have my top one two and three gag gifts okay because they just bought one so it's like let me tell you the other gag gifts that people buy the most of gotcha and I would put that into every one of the boxes okay and the framework that I'm talking to him about right now which is you know what we're going to do buy 1 get two free buy 1 get three free like what are we going to do that actually is a little a little a little Easter egg for what's coming out in my next book
(43:07) what do you how big is your email list for trophy side yeah I think we have like 10,000 contacts what do you do for long-term nurture not much okay well guess what we just found ourselves another couple hundred grand so let me tell you a stat that'll blow your mind most mature e-commerce businesses get between 30 30 and 50% of revenue from email W we're missing out a lot yeah on that so there's probably like 1 and a half million sitting there yeah and that's all profit because there's no ad spent right most e-commerce businesses basically Break Even or lose money on
(43:46) spending ads to get customers and they make it up with their email followup gotcha we just found a big bag of money how about that so this was a late nugget but I'm glad we found it I assumed because anybody who's in e-commerce or at least if you're in e-commerce you're in physical products or retail email marketing is just massive and the difference between small companies and big companies is often times just what percentage of customers are return customers and one of the primary vehicles for doing that is email and SMS and so he's not doing really any at all
(44:16) and so this was just a massive profit opportunity because he's getting all these customers in the door and then just never talking to them again and so if you're a business owner right now and you have this big list of customers and you haven't like emailed them in a while it's the closest thing to free money you just send the email out with some sort of offer and you can get money immediately for basically no cost because you already incurred the cost now the structure that I talk about with emails is that obviously you can't do
(44:40) that forever because then you just fatigue the list and people would be like well I don't want to list to this thing all this guy does is try and Hawk stuff I like to try and have some sort of value if possible now value can be described in different ways if you have gag gifts then it's probably going to be in the form of entertainment more than is education right like people are going to like oh let me let me six ways to use trophies like I don't know if I'm really into that but if if I see funny versions and maybe even emailing some of his
(45:00) content that's that really does well might be a great strategy for him to uh get people to continue to click and basically reinforce that Loop so that they want to open it because at the end of the day people buy newspapers because they want to feel educated but what they read is they flip to the back and often read the Funnies and so it's like how can we take that old school human behavior from an old platform and how can we mirror it on a newer platform so eight was our offer which we added in yeah nine it's going to be email followup okay there's going to be two
(45:30) different types of email that you're need to do so number one is going to be flows so these are based on user Behavior so when someone visits a specific product they should get like a five email sequence of being like hey saw that you were looking at the goat whatever right and that should just that should happen for anybody who opander does a twostep or abandon cards right do you have a Bandon card we do have okay good the other piece is we need the long-term nurture all right so what I'd recommend is three times per
(45:59) week it feels like a lot for trophies cuz trophy is a less frequent purchase the gag I feel like is a it's like if you buy one gag gift you'd be willing to like buy them for many people because you just think they're funny they are separate Brands though correct yeah technically kind of sep because you have like okay so I would so this I'm I'm cool with on the gag gift side okay because right now you're not making any return sales anyways right so you might as well get we don't really have an email list for the gag side because it's all through Amazon Tik Tok does Tik Tok not give you a email so I think we'll go
(46:31) one time a week and we not worry about the gag gift okay I think just one time a week of and if if your basically domain score your domain Health your domain Authority stays healthy and your open rate stay okay you click the rate stay okay I would increase frequency okay so you start with one a week and you're probably thinking okay what am I going to what am I going to email them about right right so when you have customer stories cool trophies cuz I'm sure there's every week there's like one trophy or something that's just like interesting that you guys have right probably stuff about recognition status
(47:03) and cheapest compensation so I think if I were to if I if I owned your company right so I'd be like okay are we in the trophy business no trophy is what we sell right but it's really just the vehicle for giving people recognition status and compensation right right and so my the things that I would email would probably be about how you could either give your team a pay raise or you could give them a trophy and believe it or not here's this research the trophy is actually even more meaningful so they like it more and you like it more as a
(47:33) business owner right so it' be that kind of stuff that I'd be you only have to write 52 it's not that many EMS right you could literally probably do it in like a day and a half or two days so keep it low in the beginning just to like get a feel for it see how like the first couple emils are going to shake out because you're going to have a super responsive list and we want to keep these all text all text okay yeah all text I would say link to the image because then curiosity is going to drive the click okay and also image based tend to get lower uh deliverability rates than like
(48:04) full text one and when people opt in or S when people purchase or opt in they abandoned cart the first one I would have is um reply back for funniest trophy of all time and so as soon as someone Ops it's a double optin so to increase your deliverability right and so they'll they'll reply back and then it's an automation you have to do and then you'll s them the link for the for the clickable picture and they'll be like this is ridiculous and then underneath of that so when you have the when you have a clickable link you want it to take them you want to have it take them to a page it looks like this
(48:39) whatever uh and then here you have bye so like you can have the funniest thing but it's also uh CTA to get someone to buy something gotcha one through 5+ n y are all like bread and butter do these zero thought y so in terms of order here all right so this is number one cuz this is just going to give you time back first this is probably second is it the same agency that does this and this yeah okay so that's for both of these that's one call this is fourth [Applause] fifth six put the email follow up in place cuz we're basically going to optimize other other things and then
(49:30) we'll basically follow up with everyone and then this is going to be 7th eth awesome cool yeah super cool well I think we found um a few doubles yeah in the business absolutely I love it feel all right yeah I feel really good appreciate it than yeah you bet man this is awesome going be great this is much cleaner and simpler than I thought oh good good I just got done filming with Alex I'm super excited after this I mean to have a 9-point bullet point of here's your Tactical what to do to grow 2x 5x 10x it's pretty cool so whether you have a
(50:11) trophy company or not all of the fundamentals that we're walking through here is one we're consolidating costs because there wasn't a strategic advantage to having a larger footprint number two is that we're running pricing tests regularly so that we can optimize how much money we get per customer and see how much how much higher we can drive it especially with older businesses they often don't change the prices as frequently enough and especially with the amount of inflations that's happened over the last 3 4 years if you haven't really adjusted prices in
(50:35) a big way like 50% plus then you're making significantly less money the next one is doubling down to what works so in two senses one is he had good Returns on SEO but also we know that his organic with Tik Tok is working so I want to double down on those things but if you look at how these things are ordered so I tend to order them using ice which is impact confidence ease so how big of a difference is it going to make How likely is it to occur and how hard is it and so if you have something that's really likely big impact and easy you
(51:00) start with those first and then you just work your way down and number four and this is a big one we make sales to get customers we don't get customers to make sales and so the point of the first transaction that I'd like to shift Cody's perspective on or anybody's perspective on is you get the gag gift sale but then you do everything else to turn it into a lifelong or at least repeat customer and so we're doing this through multiple paths one is that we're creating the offer to get them to come back so we can own the data on top of
(51:23) that then we have the remarketing in place that's going to happen in terms of email followup on top of that we could just have remarketing across all social media for anyone who hits his site each of these things have one clear intention which is how do we get somebody to buy again so if you like this video you're going to love this video I did with Raymond who's a multilocation chiropractor I break down tons of stuff that applies to many many businesses click go watch enjoy

Hardcore Business Lessons I Learned From A Dealer - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vZfatNSouDQ

Transcript:
(00:00) I learned six million dollar lessons at my first job working hot summers as an 18 year old in a warehouse at a fifth generation fur coat dealer and this business made it through two world wars multiple recessions and these lessons I have taken with me for Life the first lesson he ever taught me was how to deal with angry customers this lady comes in and she is piss angry he's like where's Johnny he sold me this coat and this button came off this is so ridiculous I spent so much money on this coach she's just making a scene I didn't
(00:36) go in the retail store that much because like I looked like an 18 year old and I wasn't going to be selling any 25 000 codes John the owner of the store I'm on the other side of the door so she can't see me and he's walking towards me to turn out to go deal with her as he's walking towards me I see him roll his eyes and then as he turns a corner he goes right into character Mrs Johnson that is ridiculous I cannot believe that you had a coat that had a button that was missing Who Sold you that coat I need to find them right now we'll get
(01:03) rid of them did anyone see you with the coat without the button we're going to get to the bottom of this right now all of a sudden her whole tone changes she started backpedaling and she's like I mean it you know it wasn't that big of a deal like it was it was just a button it probably no we need to get to the bottom of this this is not acceptable and she all of a sudden became calmness to me she's like you know what I I just I just want it to be fixed if you could fix the coat and he's he grabbed it from he's
(01:27) like we're gonna handle this right now he goes to the back they fix the thing in five minutes he hands it back to her and she's like oh John you're always the best thank you so much for dealing with this I'm sorry I was a little bit over the top I just you know I've spent so much in the jacket and he's like as you should be she walked out the door he turned him in he was like and he said there could only be one person in the angry boat so whenever someone comes in the angry bug what most people try and do is they try and
(01:50) downplay them and so they say well it's not that big of a deal and what happens is the person doesn't feel validated the person who's upset then increases how angry they are because they want the person to validate why they're angry and so what happens they just keep getting angry and this person keeps trying to make them less angry and then just creates more and more of a discrepancy between the two people now the flip side is she got in the angry boat and so she had to get out of the angry boat and so whenever you're dealing with an upset
(02:12) customer you need to validate their anger and in a real way if something was messed up and you have very high stands for your business the moment you say it's not a big deal it means you're not actually taking responsibility even if their complaint is ridiculous it still is your responsibility and so you have to take ownership of it because the alternative is you don't and you never get better the second lesson he taught me was about creating a new product they realized that in the summer they never had any demand because people aren't
(02:38) trying to buy fur coats in the summer and they're like huh what can we sell to people during the summer and so it came up with a genius idea we'll store and condition the coats for them as they sold every single customer code they said hey every year make sure during the summer when you're not using the code you bring it back here we can repair any damages we can sew things up we can condition the fur and we can make it last two three five times longer so you can pass it on to the next of kin and then he would give this a little analogy
(03:02) he's like right if you're going to buy a 50 000 car you'd pay a hundred bucks a month for insurance it's the same thing here Sue created this analogy that compared for codes which people didn't understand as well to a car which was something they did and so what happened is overnight he created what I would consider an insurance product Insurance products don't actually have to be Insurance you can charge people for the safety that whatever they just bought will continue to provide value for a longer period of time and the cost to
(03:28) deliver on this was so low because we had one 18 year old two air conditioning three storage facility and the upsell was lesson three was getting people to say yes by saying no when I first learned no base selling I actually learned it from this job when I was saying team storage is the first core thing which is I just hang your code up and I keep it air conditioned and the upsell is I'll also brush it and I'll fix it and I'll do these other things and so when they would call up customers and they'd say hey you know turn in your
(03:55) code for the summer what they did was say hey we're going to store and condition the coat you don't want anything else do you and they would say no no I don't want anything else and so implied in that they got them to say yes to storage and yes to conditioning the code it's pretty slick people want to just get the default option we're so trained to say no to any kind of upsells that if you get someone to say no but in so doing get them to say yes you actually click into their subconscious automated response most times when they
(04:21) say no to salesmen they save money you flip the script and you align it so that them saying no actually gets them to say yes for you end of the purchase so Lesson Four when they wanted to get people to actually take them up on the upsell that they had they gave them a little piece of bait and it was what I call sawdust and so sawdust is anything in a business that is created in excess that you normally throw out so a lot of famous things were actually made out of sawdust Ikea pieces of furniture they just glued together all the sawdust from
(04:47) Lumber Mills whey protein used to get scraped off the bottom of dairy centers because it was waste product and now is is one of the most expensive products sold from dairy what he did was he took the scraps from all the coats that they would make in the back they made tiny little things that were made of fur so think like little purses little ear muffs and so he said anybody who would turn in their coat would get this as a bonus they gave away something that cost them nothing that people still perceive value as bait to get people to come in
(05:15) and actually take the upsell what's even more when people did come to turn the thing in they would actually say well you want to store that too right and they would say yes and then they would charge them for that even though they got the product for free the storage didn't come free and if people were listening to this if you're listening to this and you're a consumer you have to get around the like someone selling me something makes them evil capitalism is the only system where both people say thank you after an exchange it means
(05:37) both parties are better and if someone threatens you that's different that's not that's just a form of robbery but if I say would you like this thing and the other person says yes and they give me money and I give them the thing no harm was done if someone didn't want to store the earmuffs then they didn't have to and they just got it for free which is a benefit and for the business just the cost of doing business is to get the person in the door how he was able to double the amount of coats people would buy the first who said no dealers
(06:00) everyone who's a consumer thinks oh these must be great deals that's why dealers aren't allowed once they got in there was a sign on the door that said limit two quotes per customer they're like oh there's a limit I have to use up the scarce resource on top of that they would have multiple strike Downs on the price it said final price all sales are final and he purposely let people in on a single file line and a fixed amount of people in the store at the same time it created this huge perception of demand and you feel like you got to go get
(06:26) yours by creating this continuity product where people would come every year to get their fur coat insured and fixed you become the dealer for life and so what happens is instead of them Price shopping you were going all over town what they'll do instead is they go to you first instead of being that one salesman who sells one car one time you become the car salesman for the rest of your life because of what you do between the sales so in your business if you have a one-time product especially that's a little bit bigger in purchase
(06:52) having little things that you can do even if you didn't make money on them and then you know that on average you get customers to buy two more products from you it more than makes up for the effort and cost of time that you put into it and this leads me to my final lesson this fur coat dealer was able to withstand all of the pita pressures and all of the you know people being upset about animals even though they wear leather and they eat meat every day he was able to weather that for five generations because he never stopped
(07:17) doing the boring work what they do has not changed fundamentally in years all they did was get better and better and better at it one of the things that I found through all the portfolio companies that we work with where you own access is not going to portfolio there's 200 million dollars a year the difference between small business owners and the big business owners is that the big business owners do the same thing for a very long period of time they do all the things that right now you probably know you should be doing but
(07:38) aren't in your business they just do those they just do all the basics every time every day and if you're like man but it's going to take me time to set up a Blog it's taking me time to do email follow-up consistently it's gonna take me time to create content it's going to take me time to build a sales team yeah there's all the things that you probably know you should do and they take time which is why building a business that's big takes big time but it also creates even bigger outcomes

You're Setting Goals Wrong - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) The reason you're busy but still broke isn't because you're not working hard enough. It's because you're working on too many things. In other words, you're busy but in the wrong ways. Back when I was running my first company, I was working all the hours that I was awake. But I couldn't get past $3 million a year.
(00:16) And it wasn't until I learned how to apply my effort deliberately that everything changed. In this video, I'll show you why you feel so busy, why this is keeping you broke, and most of all, how to allocate your effort into the best opportunity vehicle so you can turn your busyiness into business. Number one, why you feel so busy.
(00:33) So, I'll give you a biological example and a social example. So, a biological example, let's say that you've got a magnifying glass and you want to burn a hole through a piece of paper, right? You've got this piece of paper here and you want to burn a hole through it. If you don't get the magnifying glass at the right distance, you're just going to have a circle like this, but it's just not it's not concentrated enough in order to burn through.
(00:57) You have to get that sweet spot so that you can get that tiny little hole and then all of a sudden it breaks through. But that's only when you can concentrate the light. To the same degree, let's say that you want to start a party on a Friday night, but instead of starting one party, you say, "Hey, I want to have four parties on a Friday night.
(01:14) " Now, if that were what you were going to do, you might be like, "Man, none of my parties worked out." But it would be obvious to you now when you thought like, "Why didn't my parties work out?" It's because you never got enough critical mass. Because if you combined all of the people and all the people you're going to invite at one party, that party would then take off and then become a party in of itself.
(01:32) And so, this idea is basically what you're spending all your time on. you only have a certain number of people in your network, only a certain number of people that you could potentially contact to leverage to do deals, to get your help from, to help work for you, all of those things. But you're trying to start four parties at once and wondering why none of them's working.
(01:49) And so, the reason this happens is because entrepreneurs get reinforced the first time they quit something and change stuff up. And because you got into the game of business by quitting something in order to be here and something worked, that's why you still keep doing it. But the problem is you got reinforced for starting two parties.
(02:06) Your first party was maybe your job. The second one was like, you know what? I'm going to stop this party and I'm going to start my own. And then all of a sudden you're like, man, that was awesome. I'm going to start more parties. Rather than realizing that just going from one to the other, this became a better vehicle.
(02:19) And starting parties on your own was the better vehicle rather than starting parties in general. What does this all mean? Right? There's this really fancy term that people throw around in business and they say strategy a lot. And I I always like to ask people, "What do you mean by strategy?" and then they just make up a bunch of words because they have no idea and it just sounds good. Strategy is this.
(02:36) It's the prioritization of limited resources against unlimited options. It's how you choose what you're going to do and what you're not going to do. That's what strategy is. And so right now, if I say, "Hey, what's your list of priorities?" If you say, "Okay, number one is, you know, I've got party one, priority two, priority three, priority four, I can already tell you that you don't have priorities because you have more than one.
(02:59) " And so when we get back to like what is a priority? So priority like if you actually break the word down it comes from priority which means that you can only have one first. That's how priority works. Now in the 20th century people started saying priorities which then basically neutered the term altogether. But if you go to the root of what it was supposed to mean it means this comes first.
(03:19) This is the most important. Right now you're struggling to focus your resources on one party. Focus all of the people you know. focus all of your promotional effort to get everyone to do one thing because you're trying to promote four because you're trying to have four parties, four priorities priorities and because of that you have none that actually work.
(03:38) I'll tell you a fun example of this. So I had a really lovely lady Kira came to my to one of our our our events here at the uh at headquarters. Single mom of five had a publishing business. She had a TV show. She had an events business and she had like a business coaching business for women.
(03:55) and she was doing pretty well, you know what I mean? A few million bucks a year. When I see an entrepreneur like that, I just think, man, you have, you know, three or four mediocre parties. What if you actually had all those people partying together? It'd be so much bigger because then that that that word of mouth effect would snowball far bigger than what you had before.
(04:12) And that's why sometimes it feels so hard because it's like when you're starting tiny parties, it's all manual effort. It's all brute force to get those first people there. But then after that at a certain point the word of mouth start starts growing and it starts to become a thing. You start to develop a brand.
(04:26) You start to develop a reputation. But when you start four parties at once it never gets there. How do I do that? The micro people are like okay I need to be more productive but let me give you the biggest productivity hack in the world. Do nothing besides the task that you set to accomplish. That's it. Anything that is not that sentence is not making you more productive.
(04:47) If it's not you doing the task, then you're not doing the task. People have come up with productivity as creative ways to procrastinate while not feeling guilty about not doing the work they know they should be doing. Focus means doing nothing besides that that you're focusing on. Commitment is the elimination of alternatives.
(05:05) Deciding is decaderee means to cut off. And so if you're thinking about all these words, you're like, man, they almost all mean the same thing. Yes. So just because there's lots of words doesn't mean that the meaning is fundamentally different. just way of different cultures that meld into you know our word lexicon but a lot of you know people will try and make each of these sound nuance it's the same thing you need to cut off what you're not going to do and then what remains becomes your priority and so the most important decision is what is that thing
(05:30) that remains because the people who move fastest in life don't actually move faster they get more for every move they have higher leverage I want you to go through this this this process with me right now you have your priorities I'm going to put this in a quotes here. All right.
(05:46) And let's say it's like, you know, increase, you know, ads is one of them. You know, the second one is like, you know, add new product and then it's hire, you know, salesman, whatever. You've got these things that you want to do. Now, if I were to ask you of these things, if you just had 100% certainty that you could accomplish one of them one year from now, which of them would get you the furthest? Now, when you look at all these, you might be like, well, honestly, even if I were to crack the new ads, I still need a salesman and the new product is, you know, important, but
(06:21) if I don't have a salesman to sell it, then I can't do anything. It's like, okay, so then everything you have comes down to getting this done. And so, this is now your priority. You can ignore everything else because until this happens, nothing else matters. Now, I gave two examples that were contingencies.
(06:41) What if there are things that you could do in parallel? Like, well, what if I start start to develop an app so that by the time I have my salesman, then I'll have something to sell. Well, the problem with this is, this is just in my experience, is that like the parties, there's limited resources. I find that people actually do things faster chronologically or linearly than in parallel, especially when it's when you're focusing all the resources of a company on one specific point.
(07:07) Because if you know that you can only do one thing with all of your resources, guess what? You get it done faster because you have so many other things you have to do because every single person feels like they're holding the entire company back, which they are. But what happens when you pursue multiple things is that no one feels like they're holding the entire company back and then nothing gets done.
(07:23) And so this is why you feel so busy. You're trying to host all these parties at the same time. So let me explain why it's actually keeping you broke. What you have to realize is the real cost of change. So let's say that this line represents your normal revenue in the business. Okay? If you do a change in the business, then you're almost always going to incur the cost of change, right? The business is going to go down.
(07:46) My estimate is that whenever we do something new, we lose 20% right off the bat before we get to realize any potential, not guaranteed upside from that change. And so what's interesting though is that many entrepreneurs hear this and think, okay, well, I'm like, I'm willing to risk this 20% decrease because maybe I'll get a 10% increase on whatever, you know, on the other side of this.
(08:12) It's like, yeah, but for you to get, do you want to have a guaranteed 20 for a potential of 10? It's not a trade I would make. And so what ends up happening is that you end up realizing that the vast majority of tests you just shouldn't do. It's like it might work and who cares? It's not going to change the business.
(08:27) It's not the constraint, right? Like maybe we have some little CRO hack we could do. Sure. Is it the thing that's stopping you from getting the 3 to 10 million? Probably not. And so what happens is these are just productive distractions. If you're trying to optimize your way to a 10x, you've got it wrong. You're focused on the wrong thing.
(08:45) After the 20%, then it means that number one, if you're going to take a shot, it's got to get you at least 20% plus as your upside because you might not even get it. And so for me, this is my rule of thumb. I need at least a 20 on the top side so that I'm willing to take a guaranteed 20 on the downside.
(09:01) Now number two is let me show you what it looks like in reality. There's two scenarios. Scenario one is that okay maybe the thing that we have starts to work right so our performance starts to go up but then right around here we're like you know what let's do another change. And so we have these changes that could work but we're always mid another change.
(09:18) And so actually our performance is more here versus what it would be if we just changed nothing. Now, that's if this is under the assumption that all the changes you have are going to improve the business. But what if you're changing things and some of the changes you make actually make the business worse? And so, this is when I see these people who are stuck at a million a year, $3 million a year, $10 million a year, and they've been stuck there for multiple years in a row.
(09:42) It's typically because they're changing too many things and because they're working on the wrong thing, right? And because they are changing so many things, they never have the bandwidth. are starting too many parties at once to just focus on the one party that if they can crush it, they can get on the front page of the news, right? And so I had a a business that came out here, really awesome lady, and she had been stuck for a while, right? And so she was starting too many new things.
(10:06) Basically, she was always running new marketing promotions and starting new conversion mechanisms because that was the thing that she loved the most as an entrepreneur. She just loved selling, right? So she always wanted to innovate the sales process, but like the sales wasn't the constraint of the business.
(10:19) She's really good at sales. And so despite it being the thing that she enjoyed, it had nothing to do with the thing that was limiting the business. And when I talked about the thing that were clearly limiting the business, I could see her energy deflate because she was just like, I'm not good at that. I have it outsourced.
(10:31) And I was like, yeah, it shows. And I was like, said differently. I was like, imagine you, and she was like, I pay this person $3,000 a month to manage my organic, manage my organic, right? I was like, okay, imagine you paid someone $3,000 a month to handle all of the pitching because you use she does pitch. It's like one to many.
(10:48) I said, "Do you think that it would work?" And she was like, "God, no." And I was like, "Right. There were people who are as good at you at at making content as you are as at pitching and you need to be that good at also marketing on the front end." And so the issue was that she never had the bandwidth to even do this because every single month or two she was changing the conversion process, right? Thinking that this is the thing that was limiting the business.
(11:12) But the reality is she converted about the same amount every time and she just had to keep working harder and harder because she was getting fewer leads. And so she was getting better and better, but she was focused on the wrong part of the funnel. She's trying to say how like the thing is is you can only convert 100%. You can't get past 100 and you're never going to hit 100.
(11:29) And so the problem is we need to get more people in the bucket, right? And so for her, every time she did this, she would have to have her team would have to relearn new systems. her customers might get confused about her positioning because it was a whole new wrapper around her sales process and even her product itself.
(11:42) She would start losing momentum because she had these constant changes that were happening. And so I'll tell you for me when I look at all of this stuff and this is what I was talking to her. I said you just have to accept that some stuff is good enough because it's not the constraint. And this is this is counter to the perfectionist culture of like everything has to be perfect.
(11:57) First off, nothing is going to be perfect. And I love Jack Dorsey said this. He said make the details perfect. limit the number of details. Getting this conversion process perfect, the thing that was going to unlock the business. No, it's not. You either have to have a product that's so good that people talk about it endlessly and then that's what grows the business or you have to have marketing that's so good that you let everybody know about your stuff.
(12:18) And many people obsess about the stuff in the middle. But on either ends, that's where the highest leverage exists. So what does this mean in practice? If the metrics that you have for the thing that you love are above or at your industry benchmark, leave it alone. It's not the thing that's limiting your business because you need to free up all that bandwidth so that you can actually learn the new skills or focus on the thing that really is limiting your business, which is probably the thing you suck at and you don't like doing and you
(12:42) outsource. This is the cruel reality of small business is that small business owners tend to have the most ideas of things they can do, but small businesses in general have the lowest capacity to pursue new ideas. You are so resource constrained like you have so little time and so little effort and so few people and capital that you can actually do anything especially if you want to do it right.
(13:09) The best hope you can possibly have if you really want to compete is to just do one thing. Well, I'll give you an example of one of my favorite chains, which is Raising Canes. And if you want to really study business, like study Raising Canes. The owner owns all of them. He has no franchises. He owns them all. The guy's a billionaire.
(13:26) And he's not that he's not old. He's I think he's in his 40s. He's a savage. And part of the reason that chain has been so successful is because he was so militant about the few things that they were going to do well. It's like we've got our fries, we've got Texas toast, we've got coleslaw, we've got tenders, and they've got sauces and beverages.
(13:47) That's it. And if you want to have a sandwich, they just take the tenders and they put it between two pieces of Texas toast, right? Like they just take those few ingredients cuz they're like, "If we just nail this, we don't need to do anything else." And I really want to hit on this really hard.
(14:01) If you can think to yourself, if all I did was this, nothing else would matter. Then why are you letting anything else matter? And the tough part is that many of your ideas are probably good. It's just that they will fail because of a lack of execution, not because of a lack of quality ideas. And they will all fail if you try and execute all of them. Yes.
(14:19) Including the one that you love that you're thinking about right now as I'm saying this and you're thinking, "Oh, I wonder if he's talking about that." Yes, I'm talking about that. And so I'll give you a couple examples. For me personally, even at a micro level within a business, I had a shorts editor who was a good editor and then we had him focused on two different platforms and both platforms suffered.
(14:36) When we focused him on just one platform, all of a sudden the views from that one platform got more than the views from both platforms that when he was working on them split. Think about how that is. He was able to get one which he had already been working on to do more than both together when he just focused on one. You know, every month we invite entrepreneurs out here to the headquarters who are doing big things and that way we can meet more businesses.
(14:59) When we have these events, my team always thinks about things that we could do better. We made this rule where we said, "Hey, what if we do nothing new? Zero new things, just execute all the things that we know that make an event good, nothing else." And we did that and then four times in a row, we had the best NPS, best everything score from the event.
(15:17) And I was like, "Right, every time we change things, RPS goes down. Don't change anything. Everyone loves it the way it is. The thing is is that you will get tired of your business before your customers even know anything about it because remember they have zero context. You might think, "Oh man, we did this one thing that one time and we didn't do it this time." No one knows.
(15:37) No one knows. And so hopefully now you understand how changing everything is limiting your ability to win. And so the question then is, okay, you know, following my own rules, don't just say stop doing this. Say do this instead. So here's what to do instead. So now number three is how to allocate your effort into the best opportunity vehicles.
(15:55) Have patience. Now that sounds super lame. So let me tell you what that actually means. So patience is just figuring out what to do in the meantime. And so I'll tell you for me personally, I make a big list of ideas and it is like just name it something ridiculous so that you can remind yourself how ridiculous you are for always having these ideas.
(16:14) I have this mondo and I'm talking like I probably have 200 plus items of ideas that I have of things that could make money or would be improvements to our existing business or process. So this is actually my list. So I have, you know, AI stuff we can do, traffic stuff we can do, conversion rate stuff we can do, LTV stuff we can do.
(16:33) These are all tests that we can consider. These are ascension ideas. These are renewal ideas. And these are just the like and I I see them and I'm like, man, these are such good ideas. And right now we're not doing any of them. And the last time I grabbed something from that list, you guys want to know what it was? In 18 months, I've grabbed three things from that list.
(16:52) Just And I probably have more resources, capital, and talent than the vast majority of businesses have. And I say this to to demonstrate how incredibly hard it is. And what's really crazy, and this is nuts, you will feel so much relief because you will realize that much of your anxiety and your stress comes from this list that you have created for yourself that you have not done.
(17:15) And so, all you do is you basically take your entire to-do list and say, "This is no longer my to-do list anymore. I'm just going to take the things we're already doing and we're going to do them well." And I promise you, you will make more money and that will depress you because you will realize that the biggest problem in your business is lack of execution, not lack of new ideas.
(17:32) This is a lesson that has taken me way too long to learn and I'm trying to pass it on to you now. And most of you don't have the discipline to be able to do it. But the few of you who do will honestly it will depress you by how simple it can be. It doesn't mean it's easy because you will have to fight your internal nature every day.
(17:48) Like Warren Buffett has this example where he says if you only had a punch card that had 20 punches on it for the stocks you could buy for the rest of your life and once you used up those 20 you can never use them again, you'd be a significantly better investor. So if you were an entrepreneur and you only got one punch per year of something that you were going to optimize towards just one, you would look real hard at that list and you'd be like, "Okay, which of these one things if I only did this would get us the the most?" And what happens is that
(18:15) when you put that kind of constraint on, you do end up realizing that, well, you know what? If we did solve this one thing, it would basically change everything for us, right? Then why are we wasting our time with these not hard side quests? So, if you'd like our help to identify the highest leverage point, you can go to acq.comve.
(18:32) We hold an event every month. We'd love to meet you in person and have you out. And if you do those things, I think that you will have a phenomenally more profitable business. And most of all, how to allocate your effort into the best opportunity vehicle so you can achieve critical mass.

Transcript:
(00:00) had two different businesses that approached me both had franchises open I had almost an identical conversation with both and I'll tell you one of them which is a whitening teeth whitening business but a breakdown is how I help them walk through this decision of should we go more franchises or we should go more privately owned and it really comes down to four main variables number one is the cost versus The Return of every dollar you invest in opening more locations the second is the actual effort that it takes to open a location
(00:24) which comes down to is it centralized or decentralized in terms of where the work is being done centralized and it means that there's more operational drag at the franchisor level if it's decentralized there's more work for the franchisee the third thing was actually looking at this at scale if you have a number you saw for which almost every entrepreneur that I know who is in a local chain wants to solve for some big exit usually it's 50 or 100 million and if you want to own it forever totally fine you still think about building it
(00:50) as an asset even if you're never going to sell it just transparently like we don't want to sell anything anymore we want to hold and grow buy and build maybe that's what we do but we also understand that some entrepreneurs do want to sell and reversing your net worth goal into what you actually have to open at a location level between franchise and local privately owned ones that you own all of them is a good math number to know because it makes the decision much much easier and then finally is a little bit of a personal
(01:12) thing which is which type of entrepreneur are you are you more of a promotional entrepreneur so you love the sales and marketing and selling the franchises selling the franchises or or you're more of a product driven operational leadership driven entrepreneur who's like who with a longer time rise and just loves investing in people and building kind of a big thick so we'll break down all four of these here are the business metrics that are important top line per location is about 500 000 a year bottom line for
(01:34) a location is 250 000 a year the cost to open was 50. so I spend 50 I make 500 Top Line I keep 250 a year later really good numbers if you have a business that gets like less than 100 return on Capital meaning it usually makes more sense to franchise right off the bat because the return on capital is too slow and not big enough if you look at a McDonald's for example it costs 1.1 1.
(01:56) 2 million dollars to open a McDonald's they make 150 000 a year on average afterwards so you're looking at like a 15 rate of return right versus spend 50 make 250 you're talking to 5x right very different and this happens all the time I've seen this with moving businesses that have crazy Returns on Capital seeing with gym business doesn't really matter with the business is but you have to switch from your business hat to your investor hat and start looking at your business investment because once you start generating real money you have to
(02:21) think where is the best place I can put my money and if opening another location 5x is your money every year you go from 1 million to 5 million five to twenty five twenty five to 125 that becomes a very attractive machine if you expand the time Horizon we have this business these individuals had decided to do the franchise so this is what their franchise economics looked like they would get seven and a half percent a Top Line it's a royalty on Top Line and it's usually some sort of marketing fund that everyone chips into so they can get
(02:46) National branding some franchises do flat fees some do royalties doesn't really matter there's a certain percentage of Revenue that you're going to collect now these guys were charging seven and a half and so on 250 it was like thirty five thousand dollars per year that they're making from the franchise Okay so stay with me now if the franchise runs at the same margins at the individual locations at 50 so twenty thousand dollars of what they're gonna make in net earnings at the franchisor level per location that they
(03:12) open here's the kicker and this moves us on to our second kind of variable here you've moved past the first checkpoint and you're like okay our economics are pretty good like we're over a hundred percent we're in that line but now it's like well how hard is it if you have twenty thousand dollars in net earnings per franchise you open and you've got 250 000 per location that you open on your own the franchises get usually two times the multiple that a brick and mortar local chain will get so they might get like 15 times earnings in
(03:39) terms of the Enterprise Value what an investor might buy for it because franchises usually have a certain amount of open and usually more have yet to be open and so an investor is willing to pay 15 times today because they already really know they're paying if nothing else changes a 5x multiple because they know the other 200 are going to open guaranteed it's legal has to happen versus getting 8X on the individual location so 8X on 250 would be 2 million dollars versus 15x on 20 which would be 300 000 which means that for every
(04:09) location you open at the franchise level you add 300 000 to the franchise valuation for every location you open on the privately held side you would add two million dollars so that then informs how hard is it to open these locations what is the constraint if we have a super decentralized model meaning the franchisees do most of the work then it might mean that we could open 10 times more franchises for the same effort as opening one at that point it might make more sense to open more franchise locations if it's super centralizes and
(04:38) you're doing most of the work then sometimes it makes a lot more sense to actually just keep opening locations on your own provided the return on capital is there you don't need to open spend a million dollars to open a facility to make 200 Grand right and the numbers pencil out where you just look dollars and cents if I want to have a 100 million dollar exit which you can't have an exit or not but you can still always build as though a sellable entity like we will always build an asset so that it is sell not so that we sell it so 100
(05:02) million means 50 locations open privately or 333 locations open with a franchise and so you have to look at that and think okay if I can open let's say one or two locations a month which most franchise locations do then it would only take me like two maybe three years to get to this number now what's my rate of opening at the franchise level often times especially with when I talk to franchisors they're usually limiting factors internal not external the problem is internal then it means maybe they can open like three or four
(05:29) locations for the franchise which means it would actually take them longer to get their ultimate outcome and that's assuming they can sell franchises like hotcakes which is not always that easy that leads me to the fourth point on this checklist that I walk through mentally the final thing is just personality wise so if I look at an entrepreneur in their super promotion driven they love selling they love they love the sizzle they love the the hunt right of selling franchises then franchising when I'm at 50 50 might
(05:52) still be the right play on the flip side if there's somebody who's a little bit more product driven a little more leadership driven like love the Ops all that kind of stuff then it might be more of a self-sustained lower number higher value play and here's the key difference if you have a really Stark difference between franchise versus private let's say a super promotion driven entrepreneur but all the maths is that you should own it privately then if you phrase the thing that you don't like as a deficiency in the business then it
(06:15) becomes very solvable so for example Staffing each of these locations becomes hard you've got all these kind of low skill low-wage employees which can be difficult to manage lots of churn Etc so what do you do you hire somebody who's ran a staffing for a franchise that's gone from 50 to 250 multiple times that's what I would do when we invest it's exactly what the move would be we can take somebody who's super promotion driven and then bring in one or two people to support them in the things that they don't like that are way better
(06:39) than them at it and then you get the outcome where the math and the personalities work together to build the ultimate Enterprise Value and on the flip side if you're a super like Ops product Etc type entrepreneur but all the metrics say that you should franchise this thing then we bring a really hypey sales driven person into the business to go hunt for you to bring more franchises in so that you can scale faster because that's the way that your model's been set up either way these are variables that you can play with and
(07:05) those are the four points that I look at as checklist of how I'm going to scale a local business that comes to us we made a checklist so that you can actually look through these four things for yourself actually go through it and fill it out and look at both those things because you'll actually look at it as an investor and it'll make you a better business owner

42 Recession Proof Money Hacks - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rp1PzCxj3eU

Transcript:
(00:00) 42 recession-proof money secrets and if you don't know who I am on his Oxford Mosey I sold two of my companies last year for 46.2 million and my current portfolio at acquisition.com is over 200 million dollars a year and I want to take 10 years of money secrets that worked in both boom and bust economies so that you can save the decade and apply them today number one he who gives the money has the power so a lot of times poor people they're always trying to get money I was trying to get money the person who gives the money is the
(00:26) one who's in control like if you think about the biggest institutions in the world what are they Banks what do they do all day they give money when you give someone money you get to dictate the terms you actually now own them number two never trade reputation for money because you can get money back but you can't get reputation back if you think about reputation as something that compounds over time the longer you have it the more you build it the more it compounds unto itself it is your brand which allows you to do more deals do
(00:51) bigger deals do them faster the moment you lose the rep because you traded it for money in the short you cut the compounding and that's where all of the gains in life come from number three money love speed wealth loves time poverty loves indecision micro money love speed if you want to move quickly on faster customers follow up with your leads Etc when you think about Building Wealth it's not about transacting it's about letting that compounding happen and that takes time and it takes not interrupting it most people never
(01:17) achieve either of those things because they sit in decision four we can always make more money than we need this is a belief that has served my wife and I really really well we look back on our lives and we've never not been able to eat not had shelter and we've continued to increase our skill set a lot of times we have this desire or you know our animal brain wants to make us make decisions out of scarcity out of fear we don't need any of the money that's coming because we have always had enough fortunes are made by taking a lot of
(01:45) risk with a little bit of money and fortunes are maintained by taking a little bit of risk with a lot of money somebody who's self-made had nothing and so they risked everything in order to make it big but the thing is when you have nothing you're not risking a lot you have nothing to lose which makes you dangerous which is one of the biggest advantages of having nothing but if you continue to do that when you do have something to lose you can lose your fortune and so you have to change the behavior once you have the cast once you
(02:09) have the Empire six money flows where attention goes if you spend time thinking about fashion all day your attention is going towards buying clothes if you think about cars all day it's going towards your car if you're thinking about your business all day it should be going towards your business pick one thing go all in because you only have so much Juju think about it like a magnifying glass and you're the sun in this instance and you've got to burn a hole to get through to the next level if you're a spread across too thin
(02:32) of an area you never get enough concentrated heat most people have the potential but they don't have the focus which is why they can never break through seven your home life and your business life have to be aligned money-wise so you can't try to grow a business and like reinvest everything here while you're living a super lavish lifestyle trying to flex like it has to be aligned all of our business rules around money are also our home rules around money and so if we don't live with any debt within our personal lives
(02:57) we do the same thing within our business lives eight ignore money advice from poor people this may sound ridiculous but let me say it differently ignore money advice from your Dad or Mom who are poorer than you want to be from your good friends who are poorer than you want to be from people who have smaller dreams for your life than you do the reason that rich people can lose everything and then recreate it is because they see reality more accurately the reason people can't make money is because they don't see reality the way
(03:24) it actually is most of life is trying to pull these rocks out of our vision so that we can see more clearly nine it's always easier to buy than to sell you want to get into a stock you want to get into something you can buy it instantly you want to get into a real estate deal you want to get into a business you have to be extra careful you want to put all the slow on the buy and you want to put all the lubricant on the cell 10 money is fickle money is jealous it sticks and goes to the person who pays it the most
(03:47) attention money comes into the system but there are these grooves in the ground where it all eventually flows up to the few people who pay at the most attention someone gets paid they go buy their groceries the grocery person has to go by for the supplier supplier buys them from whatever working with the person who has the access is the one who pays it the most attention is the one who it sticks to at the end 11.
(04:06) we stay poor until we've learned all the lessons that poverty has to teach people stay in poverty but they're not trying to pay attention to like what lesson do I need to be learning that I'm not actually taking action learning how to save money at a basic level personal finance let's be guys it's Graham here these are the lessons that we have to learn in poverty to get out of poverty and until you do that you don't beat the level 12.
(04:26) frugality drives Innovation even when you have money one of the best things to do in my opinion is constrain your resources constrain time it'll force you to think creatively to solve problems without using money as the solution and if you have constraints right now on time and or money don't see it as a disadvantage because it's what people who do have money try to get into to solve problems and the only thing that's at the disadvantage is thinking it is 13.
(04:50) think once before investing think twice before spending investing is something that you're putting money into that is going to give you a return of some kind it's either going to give you a skill that's going to increase your earning capacity or it's going to be something that's going to quite literally give you a return in terms it's going to be yield or worth more in the future spending is something that's going to never be worth more in the future and it's going to be consumed 14 money flows to the person who needs it the least the risk get richer because
(05:08) they don't need it and because they don't need it they have leverage you have to sell not from your own wallet but from the person in front of you come to the table with our other options it's the person who needs nothing who's the person who has the most power and that's where the money will go 15.
(05:21) we make money our money does not make us you start tying your self-worth to your net worth then your net worth itself becomes a liability to your own self-esteem it is my ability to make money which is what creates my value not the money itself because the money itself can be taken my family was in the Iranian Revolution and everything they had was taken all it takes is one government saying oh all that land all those cars all those homes those are ours now and that's it and so a lot of people have this idea of legacy and permanence
(05:46) That's Just an Illusion which is why we make our money our money doesn't make us 16. it may be an amazing opportunity but not our amazing opportunity one of the things that I needed early on was permission to not do things because in the beginning you don't know how to do anything your analysis paralysis and you just get scared and once you get over that the problem is that your yes muscle becomes too flexed you start saying yes to everything we should do this thing and we should do this thing together you say dude I think it's amazing
(06:08) opportunity I just don't think it's my amazing opportunity and it's gotten me out of so many situations that I know long term wouldn't have been good for me 17. we control the money flow wherever possible people who have a lot of control payment processors everybody thinks they're amazing until the day you can't process money and so the idea is the further Upstream you can go the more leverage and control you have over the money Banks get the money and then they give it back later the person who's furthest Upstream the money has the most
(06:31) power over it 18 always have no fund me knowing that I can take whatever risk I want and I am still protected and everything that I have for the rest of my life is taken care of gives me a lot of Peace which allows be more aggressive be more offensive as soon as you can have your oh phone whether it's three months whether it's six months start putting that away that nut so that you can go more on the offensive 19.
(06:54) the biggest erodor of wealth is ignorance not knowing how to make a million dollars is costing you whatever you make every year minus a million dollars and so if you make 50 Grand a year it costs you 950 000 a year to not know how to make a million dollars which is why I put so much money into paying down this invisible hand that's been suppressing my income my whole life and yours too 20.
(07:15) you get paid for the value you create times your ability to negotiate divided by how hard you are to replace if you provide something that's very valuable and you're very good at negotiating but somebody else can provide the exact same thing as you for a tenth of the price you still don't have that good of a negotiating position making money is capturing a percentage of the value that you create for other people 21 mistakes love a rush decision I've trained myself now enough that like when I feel fomo I pause fomo means slow go mistakes love a rush decision and so
(07:41) it's just one of those easy beliefs that has slowed me down and has saved me so much money 22. leverage comes from not needing the other person and more specifically leverage comes from needing nothing you can't control somebody who needs nothing right someone needs nothing you have no influence over them how do I become that person the monks do it by relinquishing everything and needing nothing and the rich man does it by satisfying all his needs and not needing the deal on the other side of the table in both of those
(08:07) situations you create leverage 23 markets take longer to adjust than you expect and then they move faster than you can imagine The Big Short if you saw that movie the guy was shorting for like four years and he's like the math doesn't make sense the bubble kept going bubble kept going bubble kept going and then it happened faster than people imagine we have to be comfortable with the fact that we might have to sit in discomfort for an extended period of time before what we believe to be reality is reflected 24 money is a game
(08:34) treated as such you can't win the game if you don't know you're playing one the wealthiest people in the world see money as a game they don't even use money to satisfy material needs because they already have it how can I adopt that perspective earlier on in my career thinking about things in terms of personal bests bank account PRS what gets measured gets improved you can get someone to lose weight just by simply getting them to weigh themselves every day without giving them any advice at all just if you pay attention to it it
(08:58) will start sticking to you 25 don't bet the empire for a pot of gold even though you might have this opportunity here it's never worth risking the whole pie and I can't tell you the amount of times where I've been like man if I went all in on this thing money-wise the thing is that you can go all in on your attention but I wouldn't go all in on your money 26 always do a starter deal with new faces so this is a hard one one of your friends comes to you and is like dude I want to do this Airbnb thing or hey I've
(09:20) got this do a starter deal first you got to see how these people are everything should still look great on paper everything should still make sense they should still be amazing characters Etc you still mitigate your risk by saying first deal I'm gonna do with you is a small deal 27 trust is worth more than a bigger return trust lubricates deal velocity trust compounds you don't want to take all the meat on the bone because you want to have a long-term relationship when I talk to Partners when I talk to business owners how they
(09:45) talk about the people that they do business with tells you a lot about them and how they do business when I talk to somebody and I'm like hey why don't you do this they're like hey these guys have been good to us for a very long time we've had a very good relationship for 10 years that is something I respect a lot and that is what people who have money act like poor people always trying to one over everyone over and over again and they never get any trust from anybody which means they have no compounding relationships 28 money is
(10:07) not a zero-sum game the older I've gotten the more I'm like how can I get onto their side of the table and both make money together why don't we both take a big piece of this upside rather than slice up a pie that's in front of us 29 never take a standard deal there's always a better one there's always a better deal and a lot of times you have to ask for it hey this term and this term and this term are things that are concerning to me is there anything we can do about these remember earlier leverage comes from not needing the deal
(10:29) you have to be willing to walk away and I can't tell you the amount of times that I've walked away from a deal and the person comes back after saying well I can't do a deal I'm like cool no worries and they come back three or four days later and they're like all right man I'll do the deal and then I might be like hey well the terms have changed you know I'm kidding 30.
(10:45) expect low risk amazing Returns the wealthiest friends that I have who are billionaire plus they're just not interested in 10 20 returns they're looking for 50 plus annualized returns most people expect 10 because that's what the s p does it doesn't mean that that has to be your personal standard thinking through that way has changed how I saw investing in general 31 don't think in irr which means internal rate of return instead thinking how long will this take to double how long will this take to Triple it's hard to say this is going to grow
(11:13) by 25 a year what is easier to say is this is going to double in three changing how you ask the question changes how you'll find the answer 32 this is a buffetism but diversification is a hedge against ignorance and it's only risky if you don't know what you're doing there's a million games and all of them make tons of money and so it's really about taking one game and taking it to its natural conclusion which is learning every single aspect of that game rather than saying I want to be in stocks I want to be in real estate I
(11:38) want to be in crypto I would also have my side hustles I want to like you can't get good at any even because you're competing against people who are all in play one game and play well 34. I skipped 33 because I covered it in that last one returns are in the terms everybody who's watching this if you make money doing anything that's inside us on I'll pay you a billion dollars for your business but it's on my terms and I can make that deal every time and not lose money understanding the terms of the agreement and how many different
(12:01) ways you can make terms and the only way you do that is through having the conversations and trying to structure it from learning from other people 35 whenever possible use house money if you have the opportunity to recoup your principal and still have money in the game do that then you can get super aggressive with the Investments and things like that that you're making but you're doing it on a house money you're doing it with no chance of losing principle 36 always know how to get your money back you have to know the exact
(12:23) way of doing it not just like oh yeah I can get my money back she's like no but but how would I do it walk me through each of the steps so that I have full understanding of how this would work if they actually don't mean it then they won't have a way to do it you'll be able to sniff something out immediately 37 cash flow is King all right and that's both on a personal level and on a business level so for you your cash flows can be dictated by your income minus your expenses it's really your savings slow if there's one thing that
(12:46) you get from Money Rules is that you'll be switching your metric towards what am I saving every month rather than what am I making every month 38 buy for Forever This is a warrant confident in Charlie mungerism Charlie said the money isn't made in the buy or the sell it's made in the weight if you could never sell anything you buy when you are buying you could never get out of it then you buy differently and you buy super long and then ultimately that's what doesn't interrupt the compounding process and that's what unlocks huge wealth later 39
(13:14) you heard me say it earlier but fomo means go slow you feel fomo it means slow down it means take a second give a breather put some space between you and the decision the only reason you feel fomo is because your time rest is too short 40. if you can't afford to lose the money then don't use the money if you're like this is my last dollar then it's probably not a good idea to risk it right which is why we always have the oh fund 41 peace of mind can be bought and it can be sold if there are situations where you're like man this is
(13:40) going to keep me up at night don't do it peace of mind can very much be bought and sold and I can tell you make much better decisions when you've got it 42 and final a lot of people think about diversification in terms of industry but they don't think about it in terms of capital stack a bank for example is at the top it's a preferred creditor it's a reason a lot of banks don't money and it's because they're the first creditors so you can think about diversification between like stocks crypto businesses whatever you can also think about it
(14:02) vertically in terms of where am I sitting on the stack if you think about those in terms of both types of diversification When the tide goes out you're the one who gets your money back first

Transcript:
(00:00) I had a conversation with a good friend of mine about basically this business endeavor that he had done and over a long period of time it ended up not working out. But in that whole period of time he never reached out to me once. I was like why? And what transpired from his reaction is kind of the point of this video.
(00:15) I'm going to talk about that conversation and I think it absolutely affects so many people and limits their capacity and why they aren't successful and some of the underlying reasons. And at the very end I'll give you kind of a framework that has helped me through this year particularly because it's been a very hard year for me but hopefully it helps you.
(00:30) The big theme of this though is that no one cares, just win. Because until you win, effort always goes unnoticed. You just have to get used to it. It's the way of the world. I remember I asked him, I said, "Hey, do you mind if I make a piece of content about this?" He was like, "Sure, but what about, you know, from our long conversation, I said, you said this thing, if I'm going to fail, I'd rather it be on me.
(00:48) " And he's like, "Well, what what about that was interesting to you?" He said, "I honestly needed to have that happen to realize that I can't do it on my own. Otherwise, it'd be easy to put that blame on somebody else." And so I responded with,"How could you put blame on someone else?" And he said, 'Well, you know, saying like, "Hey, I failed because I used someone else's system or I failed because, you know, so and so didn't keep their end of the deal or didn't do their responsibilities or I failed because they ruined my business by doing X, Y, and Z." And they're all
(01:13) basically just like copouts when your mind gets kind of weak, right? They're kind of like excuses. But I hate to say that I've witnessed this happen too many times. And this is all him saying this. And I said, "Fault's funny." Because it just doesn't matter. No one thinks to themselves like, "Hey, that worked out really well for him.
(01:28) I wonder whose fault it is." We only think fault in the negative. We don't think faults in the positive. Right? I bring this up to him and he says, "I have a visceral understanding of the fact that I need better systems, you know, better leverage and better people around me to, you know, make that next chapter happen and so I have to stop hiding.
(01:42) " In thinking about this, I was like, no one asks whose fault it is when it works. And the reality is that two years from now, when you think about the championship Super Bowl game or the quarterbacks who've who've hit these records, no one's like, "Hey, you know, that guy got really good calls from the ref.
(02:00) Hey, that you know, it was really raining that day." No one remembers. They just remember who won. And so, I think that this is a really interesting thought line that I wanted to kind of dive into because the individual in question did something in the fitness space. And so, I reached out and I was like, "Why didn't you ask me for help?" And this was basically his response was that he, you know, he didn't he wanted the failure to be on his own if he was going to fail.
(02:22) And it was such in contrast to how I've seen the world that I thought it was worth making because for any of you who have this view, I think it does you a tremendous disservice because my perspective has always been it will always be my fault and no one will care what I got help or who I got help from. They will just know whether I won or lost. Period. Period.
(02:39) And so the reason that the background on my phone, like I'm so passionate about this, like the background on my phone is two words. It's just win. That's it. It's just win. When I think about that, it's like no one cares. Just no one cares. No one's going to ask how many people did you get help with before you failed.
(02:56) They just are going to know whether you failed or not. And I think it's it's ridiculous to to live life this way because the real real is that underneath of this is actually ego. It's not being able to say, "I don't know. Please help." And so it means that many people would rather maintain their egos and fail than win.
(03:18) And so I think a lot of beginners are stuck there. They're actually stuck in their own pride. They don't reach out for help. They don't consume content because they think they're smart enough. And this is something that's really common amongst people who identify as being intelligent. That's actually what's really interesting.
(03:33) This is why I think humility is such an important part of of getting to where you want to go is that you have to be able to say, "I don't know." You have to be able to say, "I failed or I couldn't figure it out." And so if you can't do that, right, because you probably maintain some certain aura, some hidden image to the people around you of like, "Oh, he's a smart guy or he was always good at school or whatever the thing is, like, and then you see somebody else who was dumb at school all of a sudden succeed.
(03:56) " It's because usually they're okay being like, "I don't know. Can somebody help me?" But if you're the smart one of the people, you know, then you're not willing to do that because you have to humble yourself. The thing is is that the work has to be done. The learning has to get learned. The question is what format or what what mental soup do I need to have in my head that maximizes the likelihood that I will learn faster than other people? And I think humility is one part of that soup.
(04:19) You have to be humble enough to listen, to ask. You can learn anything you want as long as you're willing to look dumb in front of other people for an extended period of time. I think the most underrated money-making habit is being willing to look stupid. Because one of the shest ways to never succeed in life is to avoid looking dumb. Is to avoid failing.
(04:43) And what's really interesting about this is that risk is guaranteed. And so there's this thing that people have this misconception, this fallacy about how life works, which is they want to avoid risk. But the thing is is that all great things come with risk. If you put an idea out there, you risk ridicule. If you want to fall in love, you risk rejection.
(05:03) Like if you want to have intimacy, right, you you risk vulnerability. Like all of these things have every wherever there is joy, there is suffering. And wherever there is suffering, there's potential for joy. And so the thing is is that most of these elements that we want out of life are double-edged swords. They're two sides to the same coin.
(05:20) We want one side without the other. We want the sunny days without the rainy days, but it's just weather. And the only way you can avoid that is by never going outside. But I think if you never go outside, I think you miss out on life. And so I think to the same degree like missing out on risk is that we have this big fear of this thing when the reality is that if you risk nothing you become nothing.
(05:40) You are nothing because nothing ventured nothing gained. You're not going to get what you want by never risking what you have. And the thing is is that the things that we have aren't always material. And I think this is actually one of the big misconceptions of people who are starting out is like I can easily stand here and say you were the most dangerous in the beginning because you have nothing to lose.
(05:57) But the thing is is that almost everyone has things to lose and most of the things that they have to lose in the beginning are in their head and that's why it's so difficult because what you have to lose is your social standing. What you have to lose is looking looking smart in front of your friends.
(06:10) What you have to lose is being the the the more successful one of your medium group or your low group of friends or the people who know you or maybe you're the first one to go to college in your family and you're the prodigal son or the prodigal daughter. And so if you go out and fail, all of a sudden this whole image that you have, you know, perfectly manicured and created for your friends and family gets sha like it vanishes, right? And your whole identity is wrapped up in this.
(06:32) But I think that what we have to do is we have to invest our identity in different things. I think we have to invest our identity in our behaviors rather than what other people believe us to be. If we think about our identity as this thing, it's like do we have an anti-fragile identity? Do we have an identity that can withstand external circumstances changing? And I only bring this up because it was so hard for me.
(06:49) And also, you know, getting kicked in the nuts multiple times and losing everything tends to make you question like what who am I? And where is my identity rooted? And so this is something that I've been thinking a lot about right now because this year transparently has been a super hard year for me.
(07:03) But I I I keep asking myself the question of like where does my identity live, right? And this is why I think so much about behaviors because we try to say like, you know, you need someone remember I saw this tweet. It was like, I don't like it that other people judge me for what I do or they love me for what I do rather than loving me for who I am.
(07:20) And I saw this quote and a lot of people were liking it and commenting on it and and then it had a follow-up to this which was, "Do I love me for what I do or do I love me for who I am?" And I think this sounds very pathy and very rhetorical. It sounds nice, but I think if you were to ask the question, what is the difference between who you are and what you do? you get a very interesting answer which is it's very hard to describe who someone is without describing what they do which is why for me doing is being then it goes into okay if doing is being then who I am is what
(07:50) I do rather than who I am is what other people think I do and so that means that when external circumstances get bad what do I do that is who I am by shifting that perspective your identity becomes rooted in the actions that you can control your identity becomes under your control and then By extension, the ups and downs, the emotional roller coaster that comes with the external status that people give you for the things you can do potentially for them or otherwise then starts to disappear.
(08:19) And I think it allows you to take the big risks that you know you need to take. I'll give this this example, but like when I started, you know, my gym business to put us, you know, put this in perspective, I signed up for a mastermind of gym owners when I didn't own a gym. Think of how like how ridiculous that is.
(08:35) Like I started at a mastermind. I paid money even though I didn't have a gym to be with a bunch of gym owners. Now to me it made complete sense because I was like well why would I want to just go make mistakes first and then go here. I was like I might as well learn you know where to put the best location and how much to pay for rent and you know where to buy my equipment and what are the best workouts and how do I find trainers.
(08:52) I was like I might as well ask them who have 5 10 years each in you know industry experience and I'll just start day one 10 years ahead. Duh. The thing is is that that seems so foreign and I don't know why it seems so foreign. Why would you not ask for help? And the only reason I can think of is that you have an ego.
(09:11) Like I just I don't know the other reason. Like why would you not ask for help? I always tried to take the perspective of like I want to be the big biggest success story of every mentor of every person who's ever given me advice of every vendor I've ever worked with. And that's fundamentally been my quote secret is I do everything that someone else tells me to do to the tea the first time and then I take what works and then I toss the rest.
(09:34) And I fundamentally believe kind of I think um either Theo said this or Eston I can't remember but it was like I can learn something from everyone and in that they are my superior and so basically everyone is better than you at something and in that you can learn from them. And so rather than having this judgmental perspective of like I'm better than everyone which is fundamentally all rooted in ego, you can always find and this is something that I've seen of people who are ultra wealthy that that that you know in my in my life is that they will actually be
(09:58) interested in people who are significantly below them in status because they will just think how do I ROI this time and they will just search for something that this person knows more about or is better than them at and then they just hone in on that. And what's great is that the person who's kind of below them in status is very happy to share the thing that they're really good at.
(10:17) But in that moment, who's better off at the end? Well, you can make the argument the person who's below in status feels great about themselves because the person who's above is asking them questions, telling them it's so interesting. But the person who leaves with more information than they started is the one who asked the questions.
(10:30) Who's the one who humbled themselves and said, "I don't know anything about motorcycles. Tell me about motorcycles." Right? I don't know how to fix how to fix HVAC fans. Like, tell me about that. Like, what else am I going to do? I'm here and we're together and I can learn from you. But at the end of the day, one of my favorite perspectives on on kind of these types of hardships is it's uh it was actually on the sword of Gryffindor, but I think it's so profound is that the the the dwarves who made it or the goblins who made it had this kind of spell on it,
(10:52) which was that it only takes in that which makes it stronger. And I just love that as a as a perspective for me on life, which is that like one, everything that occurs to us is there is there a way is there a timeline? Is there a version of the universe where I get better from this? And this has just been very top of mind because 2025 has been probably the hardest year out of my last 8 years.
(11:14) But I thought to myself like, well, historically when I have very bad years, I typically have really good things that happen afterwards. So what is the good thing that's going to come from this? What is the lesson that I need to learn? What is the friction, you know, that I'm getting rubbed against that I need to get reshaped in some way? And I've had some really interesting kind of like mental breakthroughs in terms of what I'm planning to change about my behavior going forward.
(11:35) But I will I'll give you this other kind of mental frame that's helped me through this, which is when something bad happens. A lot of the things that are bad happen only and exclusively in your mind. And so I'll give you an example. So let's say let's say you've got $10,000 saved up. That's your life savings.
(11:51) Okay? And let's say that you lose $1,000. That would be pretty traumatic. That's 10% of everything you have. Now the question is, what does it change about what you do? Does it change the food you eat? Does it change the car you drive? Does it change where you live? What does it actually change? It usually changes absolutely nothing.
(12:07) But then we choose to feel terrible about it because because for whatever reason that's what we choose to do. But the key word there is choice. We choose that. Equally we could say I choose to not feel terrible because it changes nothing about my life. And so I've used this as this great framework for like what does this change about my day-to-day? Does it change my job? Does it change what I eat? Does it change who I'm married to? What does it change about my life? And most things change absolutely nothing about your life. And so it's really just
(12:34) absolutely voluntary suffering that we choose to subscribe to. We're like, you know, opt me into that suffering. That sounds good, right? Of course not. Back to the risk of what we're willing to do or willing to take in order to win. Is that no one will remember that you asked for help? And you can never expect someone to invest in you more than you invest in yourself because at the end of the day, they will only remember if you win.
(12:57) And so for me, I always think to myself, progress is greater than pride. And the thing is is like there's only one person's pride that I want, which is my own. Is that I'm proud of myself. Because the thing is is that most of the people in my life will not be here for the rest of my life. Well, guaranteed will not be for the rest of my life, right? Like either they will die or I will die, but one of us will end.
(13:17) And so the idea that I'm going to dictate the the few brief moments I have in this existence based on someone else's perception of me feels like a pretty terrible way to live. And I say this because it's like, well, obviously we all know that, but we still do it. And so it's like what are the mental frameworks that we have? And so I like to remind myself that winners write history.
(13:37) But here's the cool part is that if you win and when you win, you get to have a revisionist history of your own life. Like you can basically rewrite your own history so that you can make it whatever you want. Because what's really really weird and very trippy that I think about a lot is that your life only exists in your mind. Like memory in of itself, like if you start looking into this the science of memory, it's wildly inaccurate.
(14:02) Like we remember our feelings about how things happen and like there's the great fruit of the loom hoax where everyone thinks that there was like this cornucopia of of fruit on the tag for Fruit of the Loom, but there was never a big a bunch of fruit on the tags for Fruit of the Loom. But we all have this collective memory around it.
(14:17) And it just shows how poor our memories really are. I used to think to myself that most of the time I'm actually not going to remember most of the suffering. And so I'll give you a really really tactical version of this. So if you've ever accidentally drank too much and you're throwing up, right? And you're like, "This is terrible.
(14:32) " I remember thinking to myself like the first time that that happened, I was like, you know, I probably won't remember very much of this. And I was like, well, that's kind of refreshing. And so most of this suffering when I look back on this will be very, very short in terms of the memory, even though this may be 4 hours of me wrapped around a toilet.
(14:47) In thinking about this, it's like a lot of the suffering that we have to endure, we actually only remember as a moment, even though it may have lasted hours and days and months, there's just these highlight reels or these reverse highlight miserable moments that we remember. And so I think a lot about the concept of moments because we actually don't remember most of our lives, which is like very wild to consider.
(15:07) Like most of our lives are not recorded and we don't remember it. It just vanishes into nothing. All we have are these discrete moments that we just choose to ascribe to memory. That means that in the moment when something's good, I can think to myself, remember this. Try and demarcate this moment.
(15:22) And equally opposite, if something is bad, I can just be like, you know what, maybe maybe I'm going to compress this one, right? Like I'm going to choose to just be like, you know what, it was it was a brief moment when it might have been a month of just absolute misery. And I know that I'm going to look back on 2025 and just be like, tough year, right? And then that's going to be it.
(15:39) But the thing is is like if I didn't go out this year and ask other people for help, I might make 2025, 2026, and 2027 all terrible years. And I would prefer to not have that happen. What's interesting is that sometimes the people who have the hardest, you know, time asking for help are people who start to become successful.
(15:54) Maybe some of you in the beginning were easy to ask for help, but then then you got the identity of becoming successful, and then everyone around you gave you all the accolades, gave you all the status, and now you're you're puffed up, so you can't be perceived as less than. For me, I still to this day am willing to pay in time, pay in money, or pay in favors to do whatever I have to do in order to get other people to help me because you will be rewarded far more in life for your determination than your intelligence.
(16:19) And the problem is is that determination just looks like a long string of failures until it works. You rewarded for being able to endure the long string of failures more than you're rewarded for your intellect at avoiding them. Because the thing is is that that suffering is guaranteed. you sticking it out is not.
(16:39) And so my TLDDR on this is that you have to incur risk. Period. You will fail. Period. The only thing that people remember over the long term and often and often the only thing you will remember is whether you won or not. And so do whatever it takes to win because you're probably only going to remember snippets of it and everyone else isn't even thinking about it to begin with.
(16:59) With that, have an amazing Tuesday. I'll catch you guys on the flip side. Bye.

Why you should quit college. - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5RiR6cBLkFg

Transcript:
(00:00) this video is for every 17 year old 16 year old 18 year old 19 year old who's considering going to college or quitting college right now should i spend the next four years going to college hopefully i can equip the parents and the kids to make a call with as little societal pressure as possible when i lived in austin my next-door neighbor was 18 years old he was at this important decision in his life where he was deciding whether he was going to go to college and i knew his parents and it's kind of interesting because i sit
(00:23) halfway between his parents and him so i kind of have both sides he decided to enroll at pepperdine after a semester he didn't really like it and i think a lot of it was because it was just kind of expected that he'd go to college there i had developed a rapport with him and you know he used to work out with me at my home gym after school and whatnot and so i was like hey man let's go for a walk and i think we walked for about an hour and we just walked around the neighborhood and i'm pretty sure that that conversation significantly shifted
(00:49) the trajectory of his life there we go all right the reason most people to go to college is because that is what's expected they don't think about the decision they just do it because it feels like the next natural path it's the same thing for having kids and getting married and buying a house but let's not get into that he went from going to pepperdine to dropping out his friends his family his friend's parents started looking at him different he was like the troubled child he was like i don't know about him two years later he
(01:13) now has 250 000 saved up as a 20 year old makes 200 000 a year right now as a sales guy what i want to do is break down the split in the road of two different lives that he could have lived or that you could live or that somebody that you know who's facing the decision could go through and i'll tell you how the conversation i had with him went what's up man so i said listen you're at a crossroads right now we have crosswords every day in our lives i was like but some crossroads are bigger than others and when you're trying to make a
(01:40) decision you have to think how reversible is this decision and how much long-term impact is death if i'm choosing between chinese and mexican for lunch it's a split in the road and it's really not going to affect much for me down the road choosing to go and commit four years of my life between 50 and 200 000 of money and the lost income that i would have made during that period of time those are very big irreversible decisions and they need to be treated with the same amount of respect and a lot of people don't because they make
(02:05) that decision because their parents are selling them to which seems like the overused one but realistically because they don't want to be the kid who did it wrong who didn't do what they were supposed to do and didn't do the next natural step that's a terrible reason to go to college i would like you to approach it with a decision-making framework that makes sense so it starts with and this is me telling him this i was like what problem are you solving he's like well i want to make money so the question is four years from now if
(02:26) you have a degree and you lost the money and you lost the earning potential you had during those four years is that you more able to generate income than an alternative you because what we have to analyze is not the cost of college but the opportunity cost of going to college the opportunity cost is the loss of potential gain from other alternatives when one alternative is chosen so when we choose to go to college there's an opportunity cost that exists and it is the single greatest cost that people do not take into consideration it's the
(02:50) cost of not doing of what you could have done in the meantime one is it's going to cost you money because you actually got to spend money to do it the second way it costs you money is that you're not going to earn what you probably could earn full time working if that's what you wanted to do you got two sides there if you spent four years versus starting a business and then four years later the opportunity cost is the business you could have started and what you would have four years later so i'm walking with him and we're this is like
(03:10) a one hour really in depth like this is probably deeper than he and i have been because i'm still this neighbor from across the street that like makes money on the internet right but his parents like trusted me enough to be like you know i know that you have a lot of influence over our son and like we just want you to know that like we know you do and so like please be careful and i was like i'm aware he's in good hands don't be afraid for what i'm going to tell your son i was like listen if you want to make money then you need income
(03:31) generating skills do you think your philosophy degree your sociology degree your psychology degree your economics degree even which is still a little more useful is gonna give you actual skills to make money he was like i don't know and so i'm here to tell you what actually makes money there's this lie that has been sold that you need to learn general education i can tell you ancient chinese literature has never impacted my ability to make money aztec culture don't know anything about it but it's classes and they somehow fool kids into
(04:01) thinking that if they take this class they're now somehow going to be more equipped to add value to the marketplace if alex were redoing the education system the majors would be in accordance to the departments of a business you'd have marketing and it would have the actual ways to market which is creating the materials of marketing and how to distribute it you'd have sales how to get strangers to give you money delivery portion which would be either physical products delivery or services delivery which would be customer experience
(04:23) customer success or it'd be technical electrician plumber lawnmower whatever it is so then you have the actual technical component of the services delivered and then you have the supporting services which are like finance hr legal those would be the things that people should major in because those are the things that you're gonna get hired to do google stopped requiring college degree big tech corporations have stopped it because they realized it too that it's not value additive if i'm a doctor or a lawyer you
(04:44) need a degree sure but for the 99 of people who don't fall into six careers that you have to have one people were like alex you went to vanderbilt i graduated a year early so i tried to get out as fast as i possibly could one of the regrets that i have is that i could have started sooner and the reason why i didn't drop out of college is because i was too too scared to disappoint my father if you're gonna do it eventually you might as well do it now when i see the guys who are starting at 18 i'm like man i wish i had started then rather
(05:08) than 23. i would have five more years zooming back out i'm walking in the street we're talking together and i told him this line i said the world doesn't need another 3-1 business degree from pepperdine another b student who graduates because he didn't really give a right he would just do good enough that he would get through and this is what he brought up he's like but what about like the social experience of college i was like so do you think that if you don't go to college you're not going to be able to party with people
(05:31) who are your age i was like real talk and he was like well like kind of if the problem to be solved is to socialize you there are way more efficient ways to socialize you than spending 200 000 and not making income you can work all day and then make my objective for this period of time to have fun then work all day and then literally go out every single night and you'll end up debt-free with savings and have a hell of a crazy four stories and that's fine if that's what you want to do i was like is that what you want to do he's like no
(05:59) and i think at some point in the conversation he's like i kind of want to do what you do and i was like well then you got to learn the skills that i had to start five years older than you to start learning right and the first thing was you had to learn how to sell let's just go down that path if you're watching this you're like well i don't like sales i told you all the other departments that you could focus on if you're like you know what i like being behind a camera then cool what do you think behind a camera means in a
(06:17) business behind a camera means you're making content you're making commercials pick one that's what video is used for right if you're like i like writing words what do you think writing words are used for in business they're used to sell or deliver that's it or legal to protect people from selling and delivering i like dealing with people it's like well it depends are you a little bit more aggressive you might like sales if you're a little bit more passive-ish and i'm not saying it's a bad thing you might like more of like
(06:38) the hr or you might like recruiting you might like selling people rather than selling products different ways to thinking about it and so you can take your skills and then bucket them into which of these departments make more sense and then that's what i'm going to focus on zooming back out so i said now we need to look at your 3-1 degree 200 000 of debt four years later versus four years from now you're gonna have saved money this whole period of time so he's living with four guys because i was like dude you're living cheap that's how this
(07:02) works so he saves a lot of money which is why he is 250 000 saved up at 20. that's not from alex doing anything like he worked for it he worked for it he saved every dollar that he made and what do you think he's gonna be able to do in four years some people start his own thing with a ton of capital and skills as we're walking through these four years what do we think happens now he's like i really like sales now he happened to have liked sales the blessing that he got was he had a mentor which obviously was me i could see his personality i was
(07:26) like dude i think you'd do well here and he did like he did well but if he was that camera guy and he really liked more of that stuff or if he was really techy i would have been like dude go start coding and so all of like you have this bass skill and it's like where do i want to apply it if you're like i don't know you're never going to know because how would you know you know by starting and then you'll gain context to make the decision later all you know is the experiences you have and so all you have to do is just always look around every
(07:47) so often be like have i learned everything that i'm going to learn from this branch and if you've learned everything you're going to learn then at that point you can make the pivot right but if you're like dude there's still a lot for me to learn do i want to learn that is it the direction i want to keep going i remember when i did my first years of consulting i looked down the road 25 years and i was like i don't want that life this is a hack that i will give you for very big decisions is that you want to keep thinking on it
(08:06) keep chewing on it keep digesting it until you can get into a single statement which is for him four years from now given the cost which of these two paths will give me the most potential for my future and he was like well i think the other one and i was like then what are you gonna do so he decided to drop out and he ended up going to sales and he was terrified in the beginning he sucked at sales because he had never done it before of course he would suck and of course you will suck too because you haven't done it but how
(08:30) do you think you get good you start by sucking and then you suck less that's how it works until eventually you look back after hundreds and hundreds and thousands of repetitions and you're like oh i'm actually pretty good at this and it's reasonable that you'd be good because you've done it a thousand times he likes sales it's probably gonna be the direction that he takes directly in his life he's like what do i need to learn now so i was like okay how do you move up it's like uh i could start a business i was like
(08:49) yeah i was like what are you what skills are gonna need to start a business i gotta know how to market i was like well you already learned how to cold calls like that's your first acquisition channels we got that handle which is why i put them there it's like okay so i have that so i can get customers all right and i know how to sell so i got that i was like what are you going to deliver it's like well i really do like teaching sales so i was like well who the have you taught sales to he's like i guess i have it i was like hmm
(09:07) sounds like a skill you need to have he's got to learn the skill of how to transfer a skill from himself to somebody else what are the other skills he's going to have to learn well he's going to have to learn how to do finances he's going to have to get contract set up so you can have services agreements things like that but again these are all googleable things that you can do you can figure those things out in a couple days it's not a big deal for the parents who are watching and the kids who are watching this at home are
(09:25) trying to make the decision is do i think that four years from now with 50 to 200 000 in absolute cost and probably higher than that an opportunity cost of the cost of the path not taken which of these two paths will lead me closer to where i want to go and if the goal is to to make income then you have to look at that 200 000 and all the things you could buy with that 200 000 in four years of time and think is there another way that i could reverse engineer four years to get me to where i want to go or if you just really like the technical
(09:51) expertise that you have you go super deep on the technical expertise and then you bolt on one additional skill this is the one skill i will give you that you need to bolt on to instantly give yourself the lift in whatever career you have you gotta learn how to deal with people you gotta learn how to manage you gotta learn how to lead you're like that sounds like the soft tough and it is but it's also how you're gonna get promoted it's how you get respect it's how you gain influence and you also realize that
(10:10) the technical thing that you're really good at is probably not the thing you're gonna be doing in the business you just gotta know it well enough to teach it to somebody else his parents came to me after like i talked to him and they're like alex can you please just tell me again on why he should be you're like telling him to to quit college i was like i'm not telling him to quit college i'm telling him to make the best decision for where he wants to be in four years i'm not telling him not to get educated i'm telling him to get
(10:29) super educated in the thing that he wants to do the best people in the world anything learn for themselves they are self-taught if you can adopt that mentality then the world is your oyster because you realize that you can learn whatever you want whenever you want you don't need a certification or permission to do that which of these paths four years from now given the opportunity cost is going to get me furthest towards my goal here we go all right what's up man what's up what's up so i was responding to the
(10:55) comments that you had that they didn't think that you were real so this is uh this is to my my youtube audience to know that jacob is indeed a real person can you confirm that you lived as my neighbor next to my house and that we did work out every day after school yep and then how are you now i am 20.
(11:19) i still can't drink yet tough life um so you're in sales now right what are you making right now i'll probably hit 2.50 nice to be king and then how much money you have saved up 210. okay so over i it was i thought there's two i thought it was 250. i got the 250 mixed up so it's 210. what would you say has been the like the biggest mental mind shift change etc from uh from our talks in our chats that's a good question [Laughter] well you decided not to go to college right is that the walk that did it i did i did go really aggressive on that
(12:02) walk to be fair so you had now at that point been in school for a semester what was the reason you decided to take that jump i think that the the line that really hit when you said and i'm paraphrasing it it's mostly acceptable to fail at entrepreneurship because you're still in school and you're using it as a crutch i think that that was like oh that's it yeah so you were because you were dabbling on the side and you weren't succeeding at the entrepreneur thing which is what you really wanted to do and you were using college as a social
(12:34) safety net to give yourself an excuse for why you weren't winning exactly and so then you uh decided to go all in on it then we went all in we did it all right say hi to me you're in the closet say hi to mozy nation so that is to confirm that jacob is indeed a real person uh with a real pulse and a real story and if it worked for him it could work for you thanks i appreciate you go back to your sales calls [Laughter] jacob was lucky as hell that he just happened to have been my neighbor um that's right jake i could just tell that
(13:08) he was incredibly hungry i knew that he had this really deep desire to prove himself when i see something like that i'm like cool like and the way i tested that i was like shop after school every day we'll work out and i wanted to see if he would show up and like clockwork no matter what every day he would text me it wasn't like me having to text him or remind him i knew that he had that desire and he would take as much as i was willing to give if this video caused you to question a couple things or maybe even brought up
(13:32) more questions than it did answers because it opened up your mind to some things what i'd recommend doing is watching this video my video about how to analyze opportunities and so if you're looking at okay maybe i don't do college but what path do i go on that will give you the framework to make the decision on how you analyze opportunity in your life and a business that you might potentially start etc hope you enjoy they're like when are you going to start like hormoza university and like train these guys on the scales and maybe
(13:56) someday

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on everyone if you've ever struggled to figure out all the different numbers in marketing and figure out what's important what's not important what's good what's bad um and you just can't get your stuff to convert or you can't make you can't make sense of all this stuff then this video is for you all right so when i got into marketing there were so many different numbers kpis cpl cpc like ctrs i like i was like i was i had no idea my head was spinning i was trying to figure it out um and over time it's kind of like you
(00:28) start to distill down what are the big buckets of things that matter and then once you discover what those three are then you can open up the drawer and look for more details and whatnot and so what i want to do is outline the three numbers that i'm looking at at a high level in any business that i'm looking to invest in or i'm looking to partner with or whatever all right and i'll show you the relationship between them that i am looking for and hopefully that will help you uh for your own business so the first
(00:51) number is what my cost of acquisition is which i call cac all right that's not i call it that's what people call it right cost of acquisition or cac right so how much does it cost me to acquire a customer now this number should include everything so that means your sales commission that means your ad spend it means the marketing team that created the inquiries whatever your software that's associated with it it's all of the costs of acquisition put together that is cac all right number two is ltv now i define this a little bit
(01:22) differently um because i think it's important so ltv is not the total revenue that i'm going to get over the lifespan of a customer but for me it's the total gross profit that i'm going to get over the lifespan of a customer so let me give you a simple example so if i were selling meals for example or selling food and my cost of uh of of delivering food let's say was uh nine bucks all right and i know that someone's gonna order seven hundred dollars a month of food and it cost me nine dollars and i'm selling it for ten
(01:51) all right that means i only have a ten percent margin on gross profit right gross profit uh on the meal sold and so 700 um of food over the lifespan of a customer might sound like a huge ltv but the reality is it's actually only 70 which is what i'm going to make on that customer right and so the reason i use gross profit is that if i were doing marketing for food for example and uh you know my marketing team was like hey man we're spending 200 to acquire a customer who's going to pay us 700. i would be like that's horrible
(02:23) because we only make 70 on the 700 which means that we're spending 200 to make 70. right and that's why it's so important to understand the gross margin of your business right because this is where all of your decisions should be based off of all right it's on that margin the third number is what i call 30 day cash all right now in the formal business world the fancy world they call this they they use a different uh metric they call it payback period which is how long does it take you to pay back your cost of acquisition right because
(02:57) inherently whenever you're getting a customer there's usually a cost that's put into it and that cost might there's always a cost you're either paying in time or you're paying in money or you're paying in someone else's time which is then payroll hours but there's always a cost right there's a cost of acquiring customer and then you have uh the payback period i use 30 day cash for this reason i think that virtually every business can gain access to a credit line which means a credit card or an amex or even a bank and gallon you whatever
(03:27) um where over 30 days they can they can use that money and then pay it back virtually interest-free credit cards are all interest-free for the first 30 days all right or at least all the ones that i'm aware of right and so what that means is that if i can if i can know what my 30-day cash value is and if i can get that to be at least equal to my cac then it means that i can use other people's money to acquire customers and this is why we've had such big growth in the companies that i've had is that i don't actually need to use my own money to
(03:55) acquire customers i can use someone else's money acquire them get the money in the first 30 days to pay back the debt and now i'm left over with customers and ideally customers and profit that i can still continually upsell into continuity if you can understand the words that i'm saying right now you'll understand how big of a deal this is all right so what are the relationships that i'm looking for so for me for ltv like if i'm looking at it because there's there's different relationships that i need to draw here
(04:22) and when i'm looking about how the marketing is working all right so my ltv to cac ratio i want to always have greater greater than three to one all right three to one is the number that i'm looking for which means that i need to be able to generate more than three times the cost of acquisition in gross profit all right so that means that let's say my gross profit i'll get a number another number let's say that my gross profit on a service that i sell uh is is eighty percent all right we'll use that as a number and
(05:00) so it's 80 is my gross profit and i have a thousand dollar lifetime all right that's how much they're going to spend with me over the lifetime which means eight hundred dollars is what i am going to use as my number now if eight hundred dollars is what i make then i have to three to one be able to acquire customers for less than 270 or whatever two hundred 265.
(05:27) 66 dollars right um so my cost of acquisition has to be less than 266 dollars all right that's the total thing now that's the first uh relationship that i'm gonna look at the next relationship that i'm gonna look at is the 30-day cash uh requirement compared to my cac and so for me if i have a one-to-one relationship between my 30-day cash and my cac then that means that i am breaking even on getting customers all right and i'm breaking even within a window that i can use other people's money to finance the acquisition and that's where
(06:12) this gets super cool all right and so using the example that we just had if 260 dollars is what it it has to be under right for me to get three to one then let's say that if i can just get my ah if i can get my 30-day cash to be greater than 260 then it means that in the first 30 days i'm breaking even in my acquisition for free and then i'm still going to collect the other 500 in whatever dollars that's remaining from this process and so those are the two biggest relationships that i'm looking at what's my ltv to cac ratio and what's my
(06:53) 30-day cash to cac ratio all right i want this to be greater than three times what it cost me to acquire a customer and that is how i know i'll have sufficient profit to grow the business i want my 30-day cash in my cac to be at least greater than one so that i know that i can use other people's money opm to acquire customers all right this is what it looks like visually [Applause] a person comes in the business let's say i pay let's say i pay 200 dollars in cac all right so i'm now negative 200 this person now comes into my business
(07:36) to do you know they've got their their little money they come into my business they decide to give me money right now at this point this could be you know day one and this could be day seven whatever because it depends how long it takes them to give me money right and so maybe the first time they give me money they only give me 50 bucks right i'm still negative but by day 30 let's say i have another upsell or two and at this point now i've made two hundred dollars on this customer what this means is that now i've covered my cost of acquisition and
(08:24) then at the end of this point i'm going to continue to sell them or they'll continue to buy let's say it's on recurring day 60 day 90 day 120 etc and i was able to break even to then get all of this money that happens on the back end for free that is the power of this concept and so to summarize this the three numbers that you need to always know when you're marketing is going to be your cac it's going to your ltv important point is that it's the gross profit not the total revenue and the 30-day cash that you can make
(08:59) per customer and you need to break even on 30-day cash to cac and you want this to be at least three times greater than your cost of acquisition for you to have a viable business and that is the game um that i try to play so anyways i hope that was valuable for you i hope when you're looking at your business model you're looking at your marketing and you have these metrics you can make decisions empirically quantitatively and the nice thing is if something's below these metrics then you just know that you have to fix it
(09:26) is there an upsell or is there is there some sort of liquidation thing can we give them some sort of special offer in their first week or two can we sell them ancillary products and we have an affiliate relation can we refer stuff out in order to increase this 30-day cash number the reason this is important is if i can make this really really big then it means i can spend more to acquire on customers which means i can even open up further my acquisition net and still make more money and obviously the amount that you add your 30 to cash
(09:52) is still going to add into your total lifetime value of the customer so hope that was over for you hope this makes sense for your business um this is how i think through these things and i hope uh hope you do too have an amazing day enjoy and i'll see you next video

Transcript:
(00:00) what's the millionaire morning routine a lot of people ask these questions if you look on youtube instagram tick tock so-and-so's morning routine the five things so-and-so does the moment he wakes up they think that there's some magic pill or some super five-step thing that's gonna somehow get them to do the work at the very end of this video i'll give you my morning routine everything that i do between when i wake up and when i work we have to define what productivity even means productivity is getting more done per unit of time
(00:23) people who move faster in life don't actually move faster they get more done per unit of time i had this guy reach out to me he's like dude i got this coach he's got me doing like morning walks red lights on it and i do a cold plunge and i do my gratitude journal he's like by the time i'm done my morning routine it's like 11 a.
(00:37) m and i was like do you think you'd be more productive if you just prospected for three hours a day i was like yeah probably and i was like doesn't sound very productive though what's interesting is that people approach the problem of the fact that they're not getting enough done per unit of time and they think that i should add more things that are not getting things done to become more productive per unit of time that doesn't make sense right why do people not think that way because people don't define the terms that they use but
(00:57) if you define productivity as the amount of work you do per unit of time probably would stop doing a lot of the things that you're doing that aren't working when people give you their advice for how to become productive think is this adding things that are not work to my calendar of the work that i'm doing how much leverage am i getting from that work so i can multiply even further at the work that i do you order your tasks in order of the leverage that they have the definition of leverage is you get more output per unit of input if i do a
(01:24) little bit and i get a lot i have a lot of leverage you simply have some things that you get more money per period of time and less money per period of time that's it what are the tasks that get us the most output for example i could make sales calls that is going to be a one-to-one input of like i do this effort and i get sales out of it with that same level of effort if i could go recruit a salesperson which would take me a finite period of time and then that person replaces that my ongoing support for that person is going to be two three
(01:49) hours a week so i gain back 20 hours a week of prospecting in exchange for two to three hours a week plus money and so the act of entrepreneurship is simply consistently making these trades of what can i buy my time back with even at the point where you had an entire company leading to one person and that person talks to you if we were to try and think of like the perfect morning routine we should think about the reverse of that which is what's the worst morning routine how could i create a morning routine that would make me the least
(02:11) effective one i'll make it longest humanly possible number two i'd have lots of steps and processes involved so that i could use up lots of mental energy before i could even start working number three is that i would become very very reliant on that thing if i don't get this one thing in then it means i cannot work you have to make your bed in order to become a millionaire the problem with that is that we're separating fact from psychology if i make making my bed mean that i'm going to do the things that i said i'm going
(02:38) to do then it's super productive but it's not the making the bed that's the thing that's important it's the fact that i'm committed to doing the things that i said i'm going to do gurus will get on this superstition around these things that they do but not describe the meaning that they've ascribed to the thing oh i do this thing to establish discipline then it's not the thing it's the discipline in which case you could replace the thing with any other thing or you could just tell yourself your discipline you don't need to prove it to
(03:01) yourself the easiest way to disprove something is to say let me find an instance where this doesn't exist and i still have the outcome that's how you disprove something in like science if there's a millionaire morning routine then it would have to be the same thing that all millionaires do you have to wake up early i can tell you right now plenty of millionaires don't wake up early you have to have seven streams of income all i have to do is find one person who doesn't have seven streams of income to show you that that's not true
(03:21) do you have to do real estate in order for millionaire no you have to be in software you have to be in web three by the way buddy doing 70 million a year with janitorial services for big buildings boring as [ __ ] the anti-routine concept came from the fact that i get asked by so many [ __ ] people what my routine was because they thought there was some magic pill of how i got stuff done besides getting stuff done that somehow is going to make them confront the fact that they're not working because they don't want to work
(03:45) you don't need to create some magical morning routine where you sing a flute magical dance outside and sing in the rain and the journals and all the other [ __ ] like there's work to be done and the question is how quickly can i begin that work that's it the perfect routine would be you wake up and you immediately work because you've trained yourself to be able to do it if you are one of these people who has a 90-minute morning routine before you start working try waking up and walking straight over to begin work don't even check your phone
(04:09) most people spend most of their time doing [ __ ] that doesn't matter and for the people who are going to say isn't the morning routine kind of like a warm-up before a workout or actually like need to prepare yourself before you start working how long do you really need to warm up your brain do you think that your ability to warm up your brain is trainable because if it's trainable then your routine should shrink and your number of hours of work should increase it is people who are like i get more done if i have a morning routine cool
(04:31) see if you can just compress the morning routine to take less time of the 10 things you do remove one see how you do remove two see how you do the fundamental equation of productivity how much you do multiply by how much leverage you have on the stuff you do if we're defining those things as the equation for productivity then the perfect morning routine should be one that maximizes the volume of work you do and the leverage that you create from the volume and so for me that looks like waking up having a cup of coffee and getting to
(04:58) work and then ordering my day in the order in which i have the highest leverage activities to the lowest leverage activities and if you enjoy this stuff and you want to think about how can i get more leverage for the work i have then you should watch this 55 minute video which is the number one video on my channel on leverage and assessing opportunities

(00:00) me quitting my job was the single hardest decision that i've ever made in my entire life so rewind a handful of years ago i was sitting on my balcony i was 22 years old and i was staring out over this condo that i had purchased because the job that i had you know paid me well and i was looking over the city of baltimore and i thought to myself is this it and this was a rock top and rock bottom moment for me specifically because at that time i had graduated in three years from vanderbilt mad come laude i was president of all these things
(00:34) while i was at school i got a good consulting job and i had saved almost 50 000 at that point and i had this condo that was increasing in value and i saved pretty much everything minus my mortgage and i was as i was looking out there all i could think to myself was how i hated my life and how i hated my job and i just didn't i felt so empty inside and i was so depressed that i really every day i would consider as i was driving like what if i went into the other lane and just like things would end and so that was like my actual reality
(01:05) and so that's called passive ideation which is like i'm not saying that i would want to you know kill myself but if i died and didn't wake up tomorrow i wouldn't be upset and that was kind of the existence that i lived for two years of my life and it was very hard time for me and so i don't know where you're at in your entrepreneurial journey but i kind of wanted to answer one of the questions that i get most frequently which is you know when should i quit and start my own business and so i think a lot of it depends on
(01:28) you specifically in self-awareness and i'm going to talk about skill set in a second but i want to talk about the mindset first me quitting my job was the single hardest decision that i've ever made in my entire life and i mean that genuinely it was the hardest decision that i've made it took me six months to do it and i listened to arnold's rules of success speech every morning when i wake up about you know it's okay to fail and i had to keep saying this stuff because i was so outwardly driven i was so status
(01:54) driven that i didn't want to take the risk of being seen as a failure and so it only was when i was literally confronted with my own you know the fact that i was really not even willing to be alive anymore is when that was kind of my jogging to awaken this moment where i was like you know what if i don't even want to be alive anymore then what's worse than that and so that was what ultimately shot me on the trajectory to you know quit that job sell the condo put everything that i had in my car and i drove across the country
(02:21) in 36 hours to california which is where i thought the land of fitness opportunity would be now mind you i was a management consultant we did space cyber intelligence for the military at a subcontractor or a booze allen if you're familiar with that consulting firm and that's what i did for two years and it sounds really you know cool and sexy but it was not at all for me and i really did not enjoy it but i learned some valuable lessons like how to learn while i was there and so i think that what most people you
(02:44) know it really depends on who you are and understanding your skill set and honestly and how much pain you're in and so there's also different ways to satisfy that pain i think true to my core if i had been in a different company or i was working on different projects at that time in my life i probably would have never quit it was so hard for me and i didn't have a wife i didn't have kids i had zero dependence and i lived on nothing and it was still one of the hardest decisions of my life because i'm very risk-averse so believe it or not most
(03:13) entrepreneurs you know a lot of people talk about how they you know they didn't do well in school and you know teachers never understood them they always knew they had to go out on their own i never had any of that i worked really hard in school i did really well in school teachers liked me for the most part and you know i got a good job afterwards and so i did not have the traditional entrepreneur journey and it was only because i was so sad deeply depressed in that time of my life and felt so empty that i actually made
(03:35) the jump and so i think the first thing is like one are you are you incredibly sad are you incredibly dissatisfied with your life so much so that you'd be willing to uproot and change number one number two entrepreneurship is not easy and so if you need i think elon musk said this on a clubhouse meeting and i just think it's so true people are like what words of motivation would you give for a new entrepreneur if you need motivational quotes or motivational words then entrepreneurship isn't for you and i tend to agree with him like if you
(04:01) need that motivation like it is one of the loneliest paths period you know at least in co-workers you have other people who are around you you can but when you start on your own you're starting at zero with no one and basically no one's rooting for you like for me when i left like no one really supported me my parents thought i was stupid and that this was a stupid idea i was throwing my education away and i was risking everything just go start a gym right which is really not even that good of a return on investment
(04:26) you know what i mean but i was so committed to the fact that i was so miserable that i was like at least i can just live my life doing something that i enjoy i don't even care if i make money and that was literally the mindset that i was able to to quit with and so i again i don't know where you're at but the first piece of this is understanding short and long-term payoffs i did not make a significant amount of money for years after i quit my job right so i'd say for the first four years i i essentially broke even
(04:54) and made less money than i did as a consultant all right so like think about that for a second right now there's a lot of mistakes i made too and you're going to make them as well because none of us is perfect there's so many skills that you have to like you have to acquire so many skills to run a business right and so you may have a single job right now and you're you're doing one specific function of one specific sub department of a business but in order to be an entrepreneur you have to understand all of it
(05:17) right in order to be a successful entrepreneur so you have to understand how to generate demand you have to generate understand how to generate leads you have to understand how to work leads you have to understand how to sell you have to understand how to fulfill and deliver and how to manage people how to communicate how to relay expectations how like how to recruit how to hire how to interview like there's so many things that you have to learn and i don't want that to be overwhelming i just want to confront you with reality because
(05:38) honestly if i knew how hard it was going to be when i started my first business i don't know if i would have done it i just i forced myself into a hole and i always like to say this is you'd be surprised what you can accomplish when you have no choice as as dark and morbid as i'm gonna as what i'm gonna say is and don't get triggered by this but like the fact that an entire race in our country was enslaved for hundreds of years and was still able to do that every day shows the strength of the human spirit and what is possible when you have no
(06:06) choice and so i think that to juxtapose what i said about how hard it is if you can put yourself in a position where you have no choice you will be successful right if you want to succeed as bad as you can breathe you will be successful and so i think that was the situation where i was in where i was i knew that the alternative to what i was doing was death for me and so it was just anything is better than this and honestly the next you know year of my life even after that was still incredibly hard but it was different but it was still
(06:33) incredibly hard and so just to give you a couple of stats on this that i think i think everyone should have data to make decisions um it's proper expectations right so the average so this is according to small business administration the median excuse me the median income of a small business owner 49 000 a year so i don't know what you're making right now but this is what the middle of the small business ownership makes now you might be making more than that there are people who are number 30 at google we make way more than this
(07:03) right and they're and so you have to understand kind of where you sit on the hierarchy and there are some people who would be so much better served there are so many of my ex-employees who ended up going out on their own and i don't think many of them make more than they did when they were with us and they probably have more stress and that's okay that was their choice and there are trade-offs you make for freedom right there are trade-offs right risk and reward there are both of those things in the aspect of this
(07:26) decision now that's supposed to say average sorry now if you're curious what's the average small business owner make according to the sba 73 000 a year now averages are skewed because there's top end people that move that average up so that should say average sorry but median's 49 that means that the most likely most repeated outcome is 49 000 a year which is pretty much the median household income of the united states kind of interesting and then the average is 73 000.
(07:52) so it depends on where you're at and how dissatisfied you are and so the first thing is are you dissatisfied because you don't like the company you work for are you dissatisfied because you don't like the work you do now both of those have solutions that are outside of starting your own business right you can just go and find a different position and learn on someone else's dollar which is i think is so wildly under underappreciated like go to a company that you like and learn and get paid to learn that's amazing right like because you're
(08:18) not going to learn anything at school that's going to be useful for business right so if you want to be an entrepreneur you're going to have to learn these things in the real world and so going and getting paid to learn is one of the best things you can possibly imagine you just have to understand that what you're getting paid for is not going to be your income for life it's literally you getting paid to learn how to do something which is amazing i did not have that i literally went from making money to starting to
(08:40) learn everything from scratch and i and it was very difficult for me now the the piece here about short short term versus long term if you make this decision expect a three four maybe five year decrease in income right you're not going to make as much money for the first few years right and then maybe if you are successful and you reinvest in yourself and you grow and you acquire skills and beliefs and attitudes and character traits then you will be able to have the long-term payoff but entrepreneurship is the ultimate
(09:06) value investment in yourself and so again there are lots of people who don't have the risk tolerance for that and that is okay the vast majority of people should not be entrepreneurs the second thing in terms of the choices right in the beginning it's do i need to switch companies that's if i don't like what i'm doing uh sorry if i don't like the company i'm working for number two is do i need to switch what i'm doing and get paid to learn which is a second alternative to quitting your position number three is if i if i like what i'm
(09:31) doing and i like the company am i just not getting paid enough well then talk to them and see how you can provide more value do not ask i would like to get paid more say how can i provide more value if you ask that question any any smart business owner be able to tell you exactly how to provide more value so that you can make more in a low risk environment and then the fourth way you can do this if you're considering quitting is start investing all of your extra time in acquiring the other skills and start actually doing it
(09:58) spend some money on marketing do some outreach do those types of things to generate demand for your business now in the beginning it's going to be a side hustle but over time it can grow and then at a certain point it will grow in excess of what you are currently making and then you can make the jump i did not do that what i did was candidly very stupid i got lucky i got very lucky i got extraordinarily lucky that i had people who were able to speak into my life at an early time point i was able to learn from experts very
(10:22) very quickly which candidly i invested in that i paid all of my savings that i'd saved up the 50 000 was gone within the first three months of me starting entrepreneurship gone because i paid for mentorship i paid for coaching programs and i bought and i and i reinvested in a gym which i shouldn't have done um i shouldn't have opened it the way i did because i didn't know any better right and so the biggest issue your biggest risk when you start on your own is that you don't know what you're doing right and so the idea is if you can
(10:46) decrease your downside risk by learning more skills getting paid to learn them asking your business how you can provide more value which will allow you to learn more skills and get paid more as you do it right if you do all of those things and after doing all those steps you still are not satisfied then be willing to make the risk and make the short-term trade-off that you're going to make less for a period of time and so this is why i'm so such a big believer in in in living cheap right live cheap and keep your expectations at cheap
(11:13) so that if your your income does drop you're still not losing money and then long term you can keep reinvesting in yourself so that you as the valuable asset can become more valuable and then increase in your earning potential and by extension because of the skills you learn grow your business so to answer the question um when do you when you couldn't start a business it depends on who you are and where you're at in your life there are lots of other steps you can do before that like switch a company switch the job
(11:37) ask if you can do things that are making you more valuable start the side hustle first then start making sure that it works if you like it before betting everything on it and then finally if none of those things uh work for you then at that point i would say okay if you have reasonable means that you've that you've saved up you have a vehicle that you know is tested you know other people who are doing that specific thing and you can do it then i would say by all means but i think that i made a lot of stupid decisions and candidly i think
(12:04) i got really lucky and so um that is that is the the long way to answer to this question which is when when do you when do you quit start your own business it depends on you i can't give you a perfect answer because i don't know who you are but those are the frameworks that i'd be thinking of and these are the expectations that i would set in understanding the average 18 year old a senior in high school when surveyed believes that they will be a millionaire by age 25.
(12:26) how ridiculously unreasonable is that that they believe this is the average right believes that they're going to be in the top 1 within 7 years of graduating high school let's be real here do we think that that is a reasonable expectation no so if you believe that the stats are against you doesn't mean i'm saying i don't believe in you i believe in you 100 i'm your biggest fan but understand that these are the actual expectations of what this means all right i remember when i quit my job and i found out what the top gym owners
(12:59) were making and i remember literally my first thought was that's it and so you have to understand that there's there's the hullabaloo of revenue which i made in another video about measuring value lots of people talk big numbers not a lot of people make big numbers most people are broke and the reason i have this channel is to make sure that you are not one of them and so uh hope you enjoyed this click subscribe if you did and i'll see in the next video

This Email Campaign Generates Sales [Full Breakdown] - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OpeN4O5myIg

Transcript:
(00:00) $2.4 million in additional profit in 5 days that's what one email campaign that we did in one of our portfolio companies Genera and if you don't know who I am my name is Alex rosi own acquisition. it's a portfolio of companies Des over $250 million a year and I make these videos so that hopefully you can grow your business and make lots of money and then maybe someday I can invest in your business and help it grow too I want to walk you through step by step exactly what we did in this email campaign so that you can use the same thing in your
(00:26) business to get ideally even better results so let me walk through the context of this business number one is it's a business that relies predominantly on paid ads it's a consumer-based business so lots of media to generate lots of volume of transactions and leads so we had a very large email list and for the most part we weren't doing much with that email list besides following up for the initial transaction and then after that they were dead to us which I definitely don't recommend doing but at the time going into this it wasn't a constraint
(00:54) of the business and then it became one because all of a sudden some of our ads weren't performing as well and all of a sudden we thought oh my gosh we might not head our quarterly Revenue goals what else can we figure out enter the email campaign cool so let's walk through the numbers so the email list size was 3.
(01:12) 3 million emails now this was over a few years that we collected these emails and it was a traditional think about it like an e-commerce setup so it's was an opt-in and then a sale and then upsells so the next major number that we need to know is that this was a $2,000 price point and we had an upsell on the back end for about $88,000 that a certain percentage customers would take now the next piece that's important for this is that we had buyers and non buyers that were on the list so this was just a total list of everyone that we had ever had now in this
(01:45) business traditionally to sell just this $2,000 item our cost to acquire customer was $1,200 so not a lot of margin there left over now you can do this because it's an automated selling machine so you can just crank on adsen with just this particular business does it's a nine figure company in terms of annual revenue but we're like hey one of the other stats about email that's important is that the cost to a Car customer on email once you've already acquired the lead is $0 which if I can have free customers that means whatever my gross
(02:16) profit is of selling my main thing drops straight to my bottom line and so as a mental contract for this I like to think about email kind of like a long-term investment account and so it's like you run ads every single day or you do outbound or whatever it is to build your list up and that's kind of like your paycheck right like you put work in and you get paid back right and it's just just like a direct relationship whereas the email is kind of like your 401k it's kind of like your investment account that you put you put money into and then
(02:43) over time it starts to compound and compound and compound and if you have an email strategy and I'm going to give you kind of an overarching email strategy that we like to employe in businesses this business just is crushed doing what we've been doing so it hasn't been the main focus but if you have a business like it is one of the easiest ways to just immediately plug in and print money and then the nice thing is is that even if it's late to the game I mean this this business does a lot of money uh you can still employ it and then immediately
(03:08) see the results there's two things about email and having followup Beyond initial followup that makes a business more valuable number one is that all sales that will come from email are going to drop straight to the bottom line in terms of profit and so most businesses 95% of businesses are traded on a multiple of bottom line and so since these sales drop straight to the bottom line it will be a big enhance answer on the Enterprise Value the second point is that if you have consistent email sales that come in that number isn't going to
(03:37) really CH like tomorrow you don't go from 3.3 million to one and a. half million emails on your list unless you know you clean the list or whatever but fundamentally the list size isn't going to change overnight your ads might change overnight but your email list won't so what that does is it actually can smooth out volatility that occurs in a business which would make it more attractive to an investor long term you'd like to have some sort of regular email Cadence because things like deliverability and domain reputation and
(04:04) things like that come into play I'm not going to get into that stuff for this video I'm just going to talk about big picture email strategy that you can employ in your business now to make money great now that we have the numbers in the context let's talk about the campaign so what we did for the list is that we promoted a challenge and it was a 7-Day Challenge and the reason that I think this is interesting and important is that number one this came from the marketing director and I think the reason that I want to highlight this is
(04:31) that this is why you need to have smart people this didn't come from me this didn't come from the founder the marketing director was like hey I think we should do a challenge now we weren't actually super on board for this because we're like hey this might be a distraction but it turned out to be really really good and added over a hundred million in Enterprise Value to the business remember this business is already a multi hundred million dollar Enterprise Value business and so adding 10 or 20% to the Enterprise Value can be
(04:52) a very big difference the second thing is this challenge actually came from the product and so we pulled out something that was already something that we knew work that we were for customers we pulled it out and we made it into a lead magnet and so fundamentally a lead magnet is a very is a complete solution to a very narrow problem and ideally once you solve that problem you create the next problem which you solve with your offer and so fundamentally that is what a good lead magnet does and this is why challenges I think are very strong
(05:16) lead magnets for a lot of businesses because they also satisfy all the elements of a value equation which I talk about in my first book $100 million offers which has sold almost a million copies so far now the value equation works like this you've got the out which is the thing that people want and so as long as you have a clearly defined outcome that they want then that becomes more valuable now you multiply that by low risk or the perceived likelihood of achievement How likely is it that when I buy this thing I'm going to get this
(05:44) thing if you have an outcome you want and it's guaranteed to get it you're this is going to be really valuable but there's two other elements the thing is is how long is it going to take so if it takes a really long time then I'm be like okay sure I have this outcome which is I get really rich and the guarantee is is that it'll definitely happen but I got to wait 20 years of investing my money to become really rich well it's not as attractive anymore right then you do uh ease which is how hard is it so effort and sacrifice that are associated
(06:13) with this outcome and so these are the four elements of value and so a challenge is a really clear outcome that everybody wants it has high likelihood of actually happening it happens really fast because we get attach of time to it and because we're going to say hey we're only going to do this one thing and we're going to give you all the steps it the perception of the Prospect is that it's easy which makes these very strong lead magnets if you want to go through the experience of what going through one of these challenges looks like and you
(06:37) are somebody who wants to start a business already have a business either way you can go join the school challenge for free it's for 14 days we walk you through everything that we have I take calls in that Community to help people get their first business online started we have everything down step by step once a month I drop a full day Mastermind training of all the people who are starting communities and making them uh we've got it down like we're pretty good at helping people get to that first dollar and so you can for
(07:00) free go to school.com games and I'll see you in there so for this particular business it's a business that helps people achieve an outcome that actually takes a little bit of time and so what we did was say okay is there a smaller mini version of this big outcome that we can just kind of give them a taste so if I was in weight loss I'd probably have them do some sort of like 7-Day cleanse or something like that again I'm not going to get into what's good what's bad here I'm just saying that I would have some person that gets you know they lose
(07:26) 7 lbs in 7 days a lot of that's going to be water but they're excited about it they're like great now let's talk about your long-term goals right because now they have a element of belief they they've taken action they've gotten some reward for their behavior they've interacted with us all of these things align with them making a purchase what challenges do is they approximate brand and so this is how it actually works the reason the direct response internet marketing world does a lot of these things is because none of them have
(07:51) Brands and so like for me for example if someone's already consumed a gazillion videos of mine or podcast of mine then if I say hey do you want to check this thing out a lot of people are like yeah you've already given me a gazillion other things and so sure but if you're brand new then what you do is you basically approximate a relationship where you would have already had a lot of interaction so you basically try and cram you know a six-month relationship into seven days so it's kind of like one of those dating shows where they say
(08:16) will you get married in 30 days and they like try and cram a whole relationship into that period it actually kind of is the same thing when you come from a marketing perspective you're just rapidly warming up you're like microwaving the prospect rather than slow cooking it which is kind of the normal branding right and for example in the school games that's our version of a challenge right we just call the school games the cooler rapper we have leaderboards and prizes and like that and so we walk people through how to start a business
(08:40) online and so we get one out of three people just under to get their first dollar within their first month which is pretty cool we put a lot of time into getting that kind of outcome and then once someone makes a dollar then they're like shoot I can see how I could make more dollars and so that's the idea is like you want to approximate you want to do it really fast you make as easy as possible make it as guaranteed as possible and an outcome that they care about so now that you know what the setup is let's go back and add a couple
(09:03) of numbers to this campaign and then I'll walk you through it happened so we sent the emails only to a small sub segment of the list so we had 464,000 people that we sent it to and that was because we wanted to test it out we didn't want to blow our load on the on the whole list and so we just set it to like 15% of the list and the reason we did that is cuz like hey if this thing bombed we didn't want to like piss off the entire list list and so we sent it to 15% of the list a lot of them were non- buyers and from there what we saw is we had
(09:35) 10,000 people who registered for this thing which good or bad whatever for us in an absolute number 10,000 people shows a a pretty decent amount of Interest so in order to get this 10,000 we had an 18% open rate meaning 18 you know just about one out of five people opened the actual email okay great now from there we had about five % of those people actually click to join the thing and then the rest was the optim percentage on the page to register that got us to 10,000 so it went from 464 to 83,000 uh that opened it from the 83,000
(10:14) 10,000 of them actually registered so a pretty good percentage actually uh who did click wanted to do it and as you get into a Cadence of this which I'll explain at the end in terms of how to implement this ongoing as an email strategy to make more money is that as soon as you really nail what that that lead magnet is or what that challenge is or whatever it is that you're going to get your leads to engage again or re-engage these funnel metrics will always improve you're going to split test the subject headlines you're going
(10:39) to split test the opening on the email you're going to split test the ctas and the links that you're going to use the landing pages that you send them to the offer that you that you attract them with the headline of the the naming of the challenge which by the way is a great way to vary this up if you do it like once a quarter which I'll talk about later like you can do the same play but you just put a different wrapper on it so for example in the gym World cuz I came from this world it's like I might have a six week uh you know
(11:02) six we challenge I might have a 42-day fix I might have a 42-day transformation I might have a six we booty blast I might have a six week uh slim for Santa I might have a lean by Halloween like I've done a lot of these accountabil buddy you know challenge like I've done a lot and you know slim for summer all of these things work um but fundamentally what are we going to do we're going to eat you're going to eat less you're going to move more and so even though the deliverable of the challenge or the lead magnet might more
(11:30) or less be the same you can just wrap it seasonally or you can wrap it based on a specific pain point that happens at that time of year so let me walk you through the the results math right so we'll do a clean page so we had 10,000 people who registered I actually don't have the data on how many people uh attended live and watched throughout the whole seven days I can get this but I'll just I know that the high level and so from 10,000 we had 800 people who actually bought all right so we had about 8% of people who made the purchase
(12:04) which is pretty good not unhappy about that at all do I think we can improve it yes but fundamentally this was to a list of plenty of people who hadn't bought they knew who we were so I'd say it was a little bit warmer than true cold uh but a lot of them had never bought anything from us before and so that resulted remember this is a $2,000 price point in $1.
(12:23) 6 million in new sales that we did just from this email campaign you're like wait a second I thought you said you did 2 million or more than 2 million let me explain what happened from there so from there we had 20% of people ascended into the AK product which allowed us to make an extra 800k from the ascensions and so that gave us $2.
(12:43) 4 million in total from this 7-Day email campaign now I want to break something very cool off for you which is that you see 2.4 million now that was derived from a list that was 464,000 emails and so that means we were making roughly six bucks per email in this campaign and so if you know that you do this call it four times a year which I would recommend you do when we get into the takeaway section meaning one time per quarter you do a cleanup we say great we're going to take all the leads that we had and we're going to run them through a conversion mechanism in this
(13:16) way it's not like oh shoot I have to do this all the time it's like all right I'm going to do this big thing we do it once a quarter and we clean up our q1 we clean up our Q2 we clean up R Q3 by running all of our leads through this High converting funnel that we've structured purposely for non- buyers so we have different hooks different front ends that has different messaging that might not have been the primary message that converts the most people which is our first you know whack at it but this is our second and third whack at it and
(13:40) by varying the titles that you use in each of the quarterly things that you do so q1 will have a different name than Q2 you'll still be able to attract people without necessarily fatiguing or tiring the list and in between those times you can then simply provide value to the list and so you've deposited some Goodwill that earns you the right to be able to ask for the sale so let me walk you through the takeaways that we had from this that you can use for your own business to make more money so there's four main takeaways that I would
(14:08) recommend you take from this that I take from this number one is smart people all right so you have to be able to trust your people to make recommendations now neither the CEO nor I so I like to say this like I also am not always in favor of ideas that make lots of money cuz I mess up too um but we were like you know what they're a little closer to it we will trust that they're super excited about it cuz the flip side is if you bash every idea that your team comes to you with then they're not they're going to stop thinking about ideas and then
(14:35) all of a sudden you're like why doesn't my my team ever think of anything it's like well because you turn them down every time and so there's kind of like what Hills do I want to die on and what times do I want to say hey give it a shot I don't think like is this going to do damage to the brand no I don't think so we're currently not doing anything there and if you're really passionate about it sure let's do it so one having smart people two which is trusting them all right so I say this is still his first kind of people related for this is
(14:59) you still got to trust those people and make a bet with them and part of the reason I say trust them obviously you want to trust them because they're competent they're intelligent and they're well-intentioned but the other thing is that they sometimes just have data that you don't have because fundamentally in a business there's data that's happening all over the place and you are only going to get Snippets as a CEO especially the bigger the company is right this is the business of almost 10 million a month like it's a very large
(15:19) business there's lots of things going on and so that person is going to be much closer to the data have a much closer pulse uh than sometimes the founder or CEO might have and so sometimes they have data that you're not working with and that's why extending a bridge of trust is is is important so the second takeaway is offers to money all right so the amount of offers that you make to any Prospect is directly correlated with the amount of money that you'll make with the single caveat that every time you make
(15:48) an offer you lose Goodwill and so what you want to do is make sure that you're depositing sufficient Goodwill that you can earn the ask and so make as many as you can while also providing as much value as you can which means that if you want to make a lot of offers you just got to provide that much more value now with this particular instance we were going to a list that we had emailed but not a lot but we hadn't really emailed any offers to in a very long time and so even though we weren't putting a ton of
(16:15) value our give to ask ratio was still okay because we hadn't asked at all and so I talk about the give to ask ratio in the content section of this book and the reason that I actually consider email a form of content is that it's one to many distribution to people who know you now it's just free which also is just like when you post on social media the only difference is that you control 100% of who gets this whereas on social media algorithms and things that distribute your content but fundamentally you're Distributing one message to many people
(16:45) and it's free and so that is what makes email so profitable just like organic and I want to add a little caveat here which is that it's okay to ask for the sale again and so all these people or the majority of these buyers hadn't bought bought this thing and so when we asked again some people are afraid of making the second ask but people get busy you know they they leave a shopping cart up and then they you know their their kid screams and they forget about it like it happens and so you can't get too bent out of shape on the fact that
(17:15) like you're going to offend people by asking them it's okay to ask as long as you earned the right and you've given until you've deposited enough Goodwill that there's enough demand there surge there that you can let loose the valve of money and it can come on and then you can close it again so the third takeaway is that you can sell the same thing in a different way and so I can sell a product on a webinar I could sell it on a phone I could sell it via a live Workshop in person I could sell it via email and so you can have
(17:46) less offer fatigue by selling the same offer in a different medium and so you can get more hacks or more at bets because people will judge their Goodwill with you based on the medium that you're communicating in and so this is something that I have found it also by the way is a great way to vary products up and so for example if you're an educator I'll just use this because it's simple uh if I have content on the internet that's free if I make a course you could charge for it or you could make it free if I deliver that same
(18:16) course in a book format it's not going to be able to sell for the same amount that a course could if I deliver that same format in a live inperson experience that's going to be probably charged significantly more than it would in a digital format if I did a live format but virtual it would be a different price point than the live and in person and so for each of these mediums even if the same commun same information is being taught you price it differently it's the same reason that when you go in person in college they
(18:40) charge you a arm and a leg for it but digital College almost ubiquitously is way way way lower priced even though it's the same information it's simply being delivered through a different medium and so you can sell in different mediums and deliver in different mediums and from my experience people will apprise or judge the decision based on that Medium exclusively so the fourth takeway is what I'll just call the quarterly cleanup so this is probably the most tactical recommendation that I can give you that I alluded to a little
(19:09) bit earlier which is I would recommend that you do this once every quarter you do this conversion mechanism whether you do some sort of challenge or some sort of defined outcome or some sort of lead magn that you use to re-engage your list and put them through some sort of conversion event with a deadline with a big promise that you know you can deliver on and so if you do this once a a quarter and you weren't doing this you could almost immediately add like you saw the the numbers there we had $6 per email from that $450,000 sub segment now
(19:38) to prove that this worked what we did was we just did it again by the way one of my favorite business strategies do something that works do it again do more of it and ideally do it better and so we ran the exact same play again to a different Subs segment of the list and boom we hit 2.
(19:54) 2 million we didn't even wait a quarter we just did it the next month and so I say this because this stuff works and once you know it works you can keep duplicating it over and over again and guess what we're going to do next quarter now that we know that we tested it on two subse segments we're going to do it to the whole list and we're going to use the learnings that we had from the first two tests and so if you are going to run this as the corner cleanup I would recommend using 10% of your list or a smaller percentage because believe me as soon as you learn
(20:18) the things that you messed up on the first try you're going to be really grateful that you didn't run into the entire list so do one two or three test runs before you blow the the whole list up with this new uh promo that you've already tested the messaging the subject head the ctas the landing page those little tests that you can run in the meantime that can sometimes double or triple the throughput of the campaign and so with every one of these campaigns I would recommend always testing some elements of it so you can always make it
(20:46) a little bit better and so one you're doing this every quarter two you can test it with a small portion of the list three is that in order to make it seem and appear different to the non- buyer who doesn't buy on the first hack or the second hack we change the naming of it or the wrapper of it so change the landing page change the subject head of the email change the name of the challenge or the lead magnet even if the core components are the same fundamentally your business isn't going to change right but the way that you
(21:12) position it or the reason why that you have the promotion can and I recommend doing something that's seasonal or doing something that's a life event for you I talked about this in the the last chapter of the offers book which this is ESP specially important for local businesses because you have much smaller audiences and so fatigue happens much faster with a tiny audience and so you actually have to have a lot more variety and I know this cuz that was the world I came from and so that's why I have all these these isms in the back of my mind
(21:35) of how I had to wrap and rewrap the same thing which is fundamentally Fitness and Nutrition right like how many ways can I slice it turns out a lot and I will say that once you have one annual calendar you can pretty much stick with it so you don't need to come up with another thing next year once you have your four big promos that you're going to run throughout the year that you know are tested those just become autopilot and they just become cash printers and if this type of case study deep breakdowns on business interesting you I have
(21:59) another one where I doubled one of our portfolio companies in 60 days check that one out

Transcript:
(00:00) I talked to a room full of business owners for eight hours about how to make more money here's one of the best moments about how to improve your offer so there's something called in the software called willingness to pay which is like what's the thing that gets people to want to buy and so they plotted everything across this chart in terms of the features like what are the things in the like the offer that had the highest willingness to pay that people valued the most so you want to be in this box over here and the four
(00:23) things that they found were exclusive one access just so we have buckets to think about this through exclusive content exclusive events and the way they ran This research study they had newsletter which to me is content but I'm assuming that this is basically this is probably video that was written and so those are the four biggest things I had willing us to pay and so they also looked at like exclusive merch discounts that were associated with the community they looked at priority support like they had a number of different things that they looked at but the thing that
(01:04) had the four that had the highest willingness to pay were these four things so these are the things that people value the most within the context of recurring Community if I were to build a community these were the things that I would include some of you may not want to do this but when I um started gym launch one of the things that we were able to get a huge boost in conversions was my sales guys were able to say like you can talk to Alex every day and so I hopped on a daily call every single day and so they knew that and so I would hop on Zoom for 60 Minutes same format every time I was
(01:37) like hey here's how you ask a question put the questions in the chat this is the format if you don't follow the format I'm not going to answer the question rather than hearing everyone's life story I could just be like what's your Revenue what's your you know how many new members a month what's the main constraint that you're dealing with and like what have you tried so far and so by getting that at least in that context I was able to just really quickly Hammer I'd be able to answer 100 plus questions in an hour and even if I couldn't get to
(02:00) someone's question the likelihood that their question was one of those questions was fairly high and so what ended up happening is like a lot of people ended up just like eating lunch with Alex because I did in the middle of the day because at the time for gym owners the middle of the day is the the time when they have the most time like the Peaks are morning and afternoon and so I I would agree that if you increase call frequency you will have more people and it makes it very sexy from a selling it's like you can talk to me every day
(02:24) so if we're if we're looking at this from a bucket's perspective this is one of those uh things that we can add to improve any offer you have and it'll be more and more powerful the higher the frequency and obviously the lower the headcount but if we're looking at very high volume communities then it'll just be frequencies it's the only thing that we can really control for okay so these are a lot of different ideas that we can do oh go ahead we have a team that is trained and and really fit and they
(02:47) offer calls instead of you how do you get people to want to get on a call with your team because we have that and when it's me everybody's coming when the team you mean uh like group calls with the team group calls with the team but it's qualified coaches they have have been in there for over a year right and they interact with the members on a daily basis if you can answer the questions better than they can then it means that they need to be better like if someone comes to me and says hey Alex how do you
(03:11) run gdn Display Network I'm like I don't know ask I don't click anything I I barely I don't even have my logins for my bank account I have no idea like you you know what I'm saying like you're you're still very good at that not to say you should be bad at it but it's more like how do I get them to be more in the day-to-day so that they can't answer because customers are blood hounds for value and so like if they're going to you it's because you're providing more value than your team is like that's the big the big principle you know like so I don't think there's like a a quick hit tactic it's
(03:42) like the only way they will go is either if you just remove yourself entirely and they're the only people they can have access to or because I mean I I did this I had I had my daily call and eventually I went from five days a week to four days a week to three days a week to two days a week to one day a week and I would replace them with other people now at a certain point the the the call uh attendance it I mean it went probably in half but then it stayed there and especially because the frequency they could interact with me was much lower like it took 12 months for me to completely remove myself so it's not
(04:15) like all right so I'm not doing daily calls anymore coffee is with Hamed you know like it like it it won't work yeah it's it's very slow and then heavy on edification and then also coaching them on how to I mean like on Pres presentation skills it's like literally teaching them how to present and if have you ever have you ever had like sales teams with phone sales and things like that okay well it's a lot like training scripting and so it's like well this person asked this question and you said this let's play it and you do game like this is Ops but like play it pause now
(04:47) say it this way okay great say it again great change your tone like this say it again okay next time someone asks this question what do you say like that kind of drilling but that's what it takes to to get yourself out of it and most people aren't willing to do that which is why most things aren't sellable so these are access from a Content perspective did anyone have any like uh and like features products that were like kind of zesty or had some you know Zing to it that that you found people were like this is the reason I bought Kenneth what's the most popular part of
(05:19) your offer uh the bonuses uh so like those fast on of like things that can fast and do something that like the faster that they can something done the quicker they want to get in so like I'm fast results or fast results yeah so um I do credit right so like helping people clean their credit I don't do it for them anymore but I give them my hacks to be able to get it done fast and most of the time it's a long process it takes months sometimes but some of the things that I've learned to be a get stuck from
(05:51) even a day or two days so that results to become real faster is what makes you go buy right soon as I say that you say the exact number of days uh yeah so like one of my things is to get something removed in tuning for 72 hours and once I say that you don't even care about the rest of the stuff like I'm get for that you know and that's one my bonus today from a bonus uh perspective because I literally just finished the third book on this um something that I've given a lot of thought to is that people don't buy because of the aggregate value they buy
(06:22) because one thing is worth it to them and so rather than trying to make this list that adds up to this thing it's more about how do I have as many very legitimate value things that on their own are worth an excess of the price and so trying to think about my bonuses for anything that way so how do I make this just every single bonus has to earn its weight that it has to be worth more than the price and that'll force you to also get a little bit more Consolidated on the bonuses um and really just focus on the sexiest stuff and usually for different avatars if you have like
(06:52) different psychographics of people who are coming into your business like I'm sure there's some people who have like really bad credit from a long time and some people just had like they had a medical bill or something and something happened right and so having specific bonuses that are going to speak that in and of themselves for that one Avatar is worth it I want to have like the punchiest most distilled every one of these if you read it you you'd want to buy for this alone it's like taking mental rent it's like every one of them has to pay rent to be there because they only need one reason to buy I think just
(07:23) asking yourself what is what is something that if I removed everything else if I just offered this one thing people would still buy and then using that as the litmus test for every one of the bonuses that you add and then I think it will force you to think of better things that you can do to make your overall offer more valuable and I would also think about that through the different lenses of the avatars the guy who has a medical emergency the guy who has 10 years the person who got in a bad divorce like each of them for that person this one
(07:51) thing alone is worth it you valuable like what's your experience when you just like he SE something last night about them yeah I've been running two in real life events every month recently and um interestingly chers actually went up which is so surprising but it makes sense because look I do it in real life event I bring the boys out to like a big Park we wrestle in the mud and then we all dress up and go to like this business Mastermind did you let anyone come anyone who was inside yeah we were thinking about now make locking it behind a 12 month first yeah I mean that
(08:26) would have been my my first thing is like just move it so then it's like this big thing because then it goes from I'm missing out on this thing to I can't wait till I get this thing and I think like I think that that alone would probably solve it as a second little tidbit for anybody else who does events whenever you do events you want to also announce the next one upsells happen at the point of greatest need not the not the point of greatest satisfaction it's a big misn number sometimes they happen at the same time often times they don't so like if I give you a steak dinner and
(08:57) then you eat your steak dinner and then I say hey do you want a steak you're like no because the timing's wrong and so we want to we want to offer them the stick when they're starving not when they've just eaten and so they like after an event they've just had like this massive feast and so they're like I'm good for a while like I'm I got I got my value and so it's like oh let me open loop the fact that there's going to be another thing that's coming and it's even better than this thing if you think you like this wait until dessert right
(09:21) and you just you just keep pushing it out we learned this because I my my turn spiked at one of these massive events I spent like two million bucks on the event just make it this like wild crazy thing everyone's like this was awesome thank you so much like and I was like what but churn going into the event went down so it's like okay how do I get that to stay it's like oh you just always have one that they know that they can come to and then I think put it past the 12 month and you'll be golden all right so events I'm going to put two bullets here number one is uh have next planned
(10:01) and then lock after six to 12 oops months make it something people earn from a value perspective of something else to add as a bonus like conferences events things like that tend to have real price tags associated with them and if you're charging $7 you're like Well normally I would charge $99 for this two-day virtual event or something you get that and again you can you can put it later on so that they they they lean into to staying for it as an aside and probably an obvious point but I might as well
(10:36) make it um you can also sell stuff at those events just thr out there fine line though is you don't want to be spamming too much so if you have speakers you don't let them sell at all no no no no no no no no like no like no one sells it your event but you and if you're going to sell one of the things I think I think people make a mistake of is these people already like you you don't need to have a very long pitch you just need to present the offer and be like hey by the way I've had you know number of you guys been talking about this stuff talk you 15 minutes if you want do it before launch or do it before like do it before a talking period so
(11:10) that if you have sales guys or whatever they can help sign people up having looked at data across our portfolio companies at run events um one really interesting thing has come out which is that if you can segment the audience of the people who are attending based on revenue and income I used to think about like what percentage of the audience am I converting and now I just don't care at all it's just of qualified people in the room who am I converting like you can absolutely go into a room and close
(11:34) 80% if everyone's qualified and so a lot of those events from an upsell perspective are going to be about who's in the room anyone even do a newsletter here well people value it that would be like posts in the community yeah I would post and then and then uh send email to everyone I think an easy one is to get your successful students and interview them it's like a testimonial and content and motivation I think a lot of you guys were saying how do you get your people motivated hearing of people that are like them winning is the best
(12:11) one of the other things that um to talking about like what makes a company sellable these success interviews so uh we do this thing in our portfolio companies called life cycle ads so there's a lot of different ad types that you can do that are outside of your face and one of my favorite ones is life cycle ads you'll see some from school soon um but basically these success interviews if you're smart about it you actually walk them through an epiphany bridge and so what that means is I'll just draw it so you've got
(12:42) internal external and then before during and after like I've looked at a zillion testimonial templates but that's the one that I've been able to teach and my team can do it which is what was life like before internally before you saw this did this what were the external stats that other people would observe about you before you decide to do this thing what made you like what made you actually take the next step externally and then internally what were the things that you were most concerned about and this is like the key question and I'll explain why in a second but someone's
(13:25) like yeah I I uh you know I I was struggling I you you know my my wife didn't respect me anymore cuz I couldn't make money and then external stuff I was making $33,000 a month I was behind on payments I almost lost our house I had to downgrade our car external stuff and so then you know I saw an ad from Alex whatever and it kind of caught my eye and we're like well what were your biggest concerns well I didn't know if it was legit um well then what made you decide to do it anyways well I saw all the other people that had you know had testimonials and they looked like gyms like mine and actually found somebody on the page that had almost the exact same
(14:01) model as me and I was like okay well if I work for that guy maybe I'll give it a shot and this is why it's so key in the decision-making process because you're literally talking to the prospect from a prospect not you walking through them making a decision about why they laid their fears and their concerns and took the next step anyways and then you're on the interview now and you say okay well what's life like now externally and internally well now I had I was able to get back the car I upgraded we moved to a better neighborhood my kids can go to a better school and I feel better about
(14:30) myself blah blah blah right and so this is one part of the life cycle and so um you can condense that into a 60 or 90c ad with just the Highlight points and it also becomes an ad and so when you're running these interviews it's content its bonuses and its ads let me hit a couple uh of these I think I can probably just round them out pretty quickly attracting the right people comes down to what bonuses you're promoting and what promises go with them and so like most times people like I want to get richer people but when
(15:00) someone poor comes on the phone I still take their money if you want to attract better customers you have to be able and willing to turn away worse customers all right I'm going to tell a three minute story but that way you'll remember it um I did a Consulting day years ago with a guy who is in my space in the gym space many years ago and he had the same sales velocity as me so he was selling the same number of people as I was but we were making 70 times more profit than he was and his cost to acire customer was
(15:25) about the same as mine selling about the same number of units but the main difference is that his customers were worth $5,000 and my customers were worth $442,000 and so the thing is is that he just ran ads about like hey if you're in Fitness and you want to make money come to me and my ads were you have to be a gym owner you have to have ass signed lease you have to have at least one employee and you have to have at least 30 members at your gym and the way that we figured that out was that we looked at all of our customers found the top 20% said what do these people have in
(15:57) common and then we made that the qualification and then that ran through every part of the funnel so that was in the ads we said this is who it's for this is who it's not for if you're a trainer if you just want to make money online if you want to do all these things this is not for you and then R people were like thank God I just wanted to have like a legit place where real gyms real businesses are here who are dealing with employees and all that stuff and so also to that same degree if you have bonuses and you know that these beginners love that bonus cross it off
(16:26) because the people who are going to be the better avatars are going to have a very different set of things that will be valuable for that and so it's a it's a big strategic change like your offer changes your bonuses change your marketing changes your funnel changes like you change the business entirely when you when you decide to attract better customers if you are serious about it otherwise it's just a complaint forever like for example a really business you know busy business owner to um to your point um they might not want calls but they might
(16:56) love the fact that they can just DM or slack or something like that not slack but you know like DM um to get access and have quick responses that might be more valuable than even having calls and if you're dealing with Founders then it's like Founders is very broad but if it's like Tech Founders then it's like okay well then that's now we can get we can get really juicy on this and make stuff that that they would want like we also have our pitch deck that has already generated over $100 million in fundraising and you can just copy and paste your logo in and then your benefit and selling points that alone is worth more than the price of
(17:27) this thing for 5 years so that's about attracting the right people we covered what to add so let's talk High ticket versus low ticket coexisting and versus transition so as long as the price points aren't like too close then I don't think you're going to have an issue of uh cannibalization like and the right type of customer just wants to pay more to have more support more implementation help more Etc fundamentally like I like to think of the clear line between the two as implementation versus stuff
(17:59) that's unlimited has no marginal cost that's how I would differentiate those things um the things that are not immediately scalable are the things that you charge more for so you're doing a low ticket when do you when should you even think about adding a higher ticket thing you have a lot more team a lot more employees you have more reputation risk that goes like the amount that people are upset for for $7 a month is very different than $10,000 just a very different level of upset if something doesn't deliver um and I will hit on this scammer thing because we might as
(18:33) well hit it now the big reason the information Market has the reputation it does is not because of what they teach it's because of what they promise we have workshops here we don't do them for free because we incur costs in order to like put these on we have Caterers we have all the stuff right no one's upset because I don't promise anything I say I'll share the stuff that has worked well for me and if it works for you then great you get in trouble when you say you will make $10,000 a month in 30 days and they
(19:03) don't make $10,000 a month in 30 days and the vast majority don't make $10,000 a month in 30 days that's like that is fun like Dave Ramsey so like let's zooming all the way out like the people that you want to look at from a brand perspective Dave Ramsey is a guru he sells courses he sells events he sells an app and he sells coaching literally his four products he sells media to technically to advertisers but those are the four main products that he sells how does he do it in a way that no one calls Dave Ramsey a scam because the promises that he makes
(19:36) are absolutely justifiable if you save $2,000 a month you will have $2,000 more dollars a month no one's going to fight him on that if you didn't save the money you didn't save the money right now that's part of the unique thing about his particular business is that everyone makes some amount of money and he says if you spend less of it you will have more left over and if you listen to any of his stuff he he doesn't even he doesn't even make claims he just provides value and then enough people because when you're just providing value you grow at such a faster rate that then people just want to they just want more
(20:08) and so I think someone else was early asking questions like what is free versus what isn't in terms of uh content honestly the same stuff and that's why and to be fair I take that more as my free stuff should be just as good as my paid stuff more than my paid stuff is is now junk because my free stuff is not good like I spend a year on a book that I give away every year and I just want that to be so exceptional that it spreads on its own and so I think if you think about how do I make my amazing free stuff just as
(20:40) good as my amazing paid stuff at some point you just you draw a line and you say if you want more of that you can pay for it and people will be like well I consumed all this I want more and they'll pay for it because this was worth more than the price of free and it was worth more than the time they gave go for it yeah so my question I guess is more specific on not that it's difficult to satisfy customers we have no issue with that we have had not a single complaint from people calling us a scam sure from the program the issue
(21:13) is because it's high ticket people want to look it up people that didn't buy that just went the sales call they're the ones that are posting this negativity a lot of times you just how to tell these people are crazy but just by the way they write but we've had a threat yeah but we've had a threat on RD grow for example when people search it show thought and so it's like what do you do to combat that let me let me zoom out for you one every single YouTube video that I post people are like he's just trying to sell his course I don't even have a course for sale so like
(21:46) point one point two is that the only way that you combat that is being 10 times louder so think about it as like a percentage of Mind space that exists they're this loud if you're this loud then they're 50% of the talking about you so you drown it out you shrink them into irrelevance it's the only way you deal with it because you're not going to change humans people who don't know you will make an assumption because you teach anything about making money that you automatically have these things that they've seen from other people who teach
(22:16) money and so they will just make that Association on their own which by the way is what branding is so like you're not like as long as you do this stuff that will happen and so the question is what do you do about it I don't think buying the radit thread is the the answer because another one will come up it doesn't really matter you just need to do this WR yeah like zero attention like and I'm only going to highlight this because you're here because this is important the fact that like you flew here and like the most pressing question or one of the most pressing questions you had was this is
(22:48) them winning because all of that mind space could just go towards making more money making the business better making the product better like they get zero like in general also if someone like makes a big public blast or they do a hit piece and I'm sure I will get one in the future at some point I will never acknowledge it why would I why would I why would I tell my audience about this thing like that's that's the biggest gift in the world now all these people are telling their audiences about you and they're doing it for free okay so that was um that was about attracting
(23:24) the oh this was this one coexisting between the two and the when uh it's yeah it's it's an entirely different business if you want to do that like it will absolutely be absolutely be a increase in in income uh the process is is basically weaving it into the customer Journey so if you have your journey for the customer who comes in they you know they get an event at month you know whatever three and they've got their coffee with hems every day d d lots of coffee this is awesome we want to make sure that the communication that's going to them during this period of time we want to have a
(23:57) point that's an activation point which basically demonstrates that they're ready you don't want to pitch everybody in the community because it it's not for everybody and everyone wouldn't benefit and it just won't look good but if someone has now reached a certain level like they hit a th000 subscribers or whatever the metric is for you say hey guess what you won this and then you have a call and so that call you provide value and then you just ask them if they want to do next steps it's just and all you do in that call is say you're here you want to get here you will absolutely get there on
(24:32) your own the question is whether you want to take it 5 years or you want to have it take 5 months yeah go ahead um I've got a good one in terms of when you know if you should offer a high ticket because I think Hamel was kind of talking about this okay yeah that's the process um so what I found when I was selling L ticket first because that's how we got started was that a lot of my successful students wanted more they kept coming to me and they like how I've already hit the goal that this course was for and I want I've got more money but I want more I want to
(25:09) go to the next level and you don't have anything like I want more like what they were they were like basically offering to pay me money for something more and once there's enough of those happening that's when you know that there's a need for a second level basically does that make sense yeah need you need the demand yeah definitely don't put it in until there's a you can see a clear need cuz then all you do is when you see these people hit this Lev a lot of them will ask for it and then you can just message
(25:41) those particular people that way you're not like smashing everyone in your community every day about your high ticket thing it's more just Cherry picket and you get the best people in with without even really promoting it does that make sense that's what I've found works well you can engineer the activation Point by telling them that as soon as they hit the objective metrics they win an award like for us we had a sword so when a when Jim hit a million dollars a year they would get a sword and so we' do the live event like when we do the our events we'd have a award ceremony and everyone get kned whatever
(26:15) they get the sword but whatever that that number is for you they're going to turn in a video they're going to turn in substantiation all of that becomes ads by the way the second way of getting ads from people um and then you also can then just they will just lean into you because they want the thing and then you can then Ascend but I really I will I will reemphasize Sam's Point that like you can you can never do it too late you absolutely can do it too early because like if you waited four years and you have this massive
(26:44) Community it'll just be better like the engine's still going to be the front end like the the community the low ticket on the front end is still going to be the main economic engine that drives the demand into the higher ticket did you guys see the guy who won the school games this month in March so this guy's a high ticket guy selling Insurance stuff or whatever and he sold a $110,000 thing that was his whole business he came on school and then he wanted to win the recordings from today so by the way shout out um so and so he
(27:13) just got on the phone with his normal customers and instead of selling the 10K thing he just uh sold them $1,000 like $999 for a year and put him into the school community and just got three of them on because he wanted to get the free recordings but then the sales were so easy that he switched his model and sold 50 people into that in the in like 20 something days and so um I I mean Sam and I've talked about this at length but I think there there is a movement that's that's moving more from like Grass Is
(27:45) Always Greener there's tons of operational challenges that that exist with high ticket um in general and it also have to factoring profit cuz yeah I know in the info space you hear a lot of numbers throwing around was Revenue yeah like million a month it's everyone's goal but I've met a many people that make million a month that actually profit less than hamson so like CU he has no ads and he just employs his sibling and he lives at and the easiest way for H to double is just to do Affiliates so like he could get to 400 Grand a month and I know a lot of people
(28:24) that make a mill a month don't make 400 Grand a month profit for sure like 100 so always be more realistic about it like you hear these big numbers but by the time you pay a sales team and ads a lot of that money's gone if I could go back in time again we talk about sellability of a business um gym launch was by far the most expensive player in the market so ours was $4,000 a month 43 technically um per month to gym owners who on average take home $30,000 a year tough there was another guy actually in
(29:05) the UK and I noticed this price point continued to reappear but there were guys who were able to get like 36-month 40 plus month ltvs selling more or less the same thing not the same thing obviously but like at like $800 to $1,200 a month and so the what I realized from gym launch and we've you know obviously we've since changed the pricing and whatnot was that we had to price to people's worst month cuz even though if we made on average so the average GM for us added an extra 120,000 in profit per year just using the system
(29:37) that we had and so for me I was like okay well net of us it was 120 it was 160 with us like if we didn't if we were free right so we made a 160 net of us is 120 in extra profit now again these guys are making 30 so I quadrupled their income like pretty sexy offer and we did that on average but they would still cancel if they had a bad month and so I saw that these other people were able to maintain customers because they had they were above their worst month they still could afford the thing and so because of that they knew
(30:14) that if it got one thing a year it would pay for it and they were willing to continue to pay at that price point and so there's a wild difference between what someone will pay at their searing hot pain Point versus what they will pay after they had a stake dinner like do you still want to have some stake well I might want to have some stake tomorrow so maybe I'll be willing to pay but significantly less like that price point compared to the value is where people continue to pay it's just it's I was impatient because I wanted to make the money but if I had known like but for
(30:44) context if I had 6,000 gyms right now paying $1,000 a month I'd be making 6 million a month or that business be doing 6 million a month just on that side we had the supplement side too um and so that would have also been significantly more profitable I think if you really do provide value you might find that there's an amazing spot at like $700 a month that people just like you the thing is you'll be able to sell like n for selling will go up like 8X right and so that's where like that this is literally just a pricing graph and then you just look at Max units and LTV by the way for everybody small group
(31:19) is the most profitable way to do it

I SPENT $100,000 on courses, so you don't have to... - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video i'm going to explain to you exactly why the courses that you buy are not making you money and it is not for the reason that you think this was um kind of prompted because i was tagged in something where someone was like i thought this guy sucked and it was because i heard some other guy talking about him and so i just immediately you know made a judgment and now i started watching his youtube and i read his book i remember all offers you can get it for 99 cents and i was like oh this guy is pretty legit
(00:29) and for some reason this has got me hit my head racing on a number of different topics and i tried to write them all down on my phone so i could make this for you but i'm going to explain to you why your course didn't make you money i'm going to explain how you can try and use get the best out of courses how you can know how to use judgment and when to apply it and finally i'll explain to you why spanish is a scam all right lots of lots of pack stuff today first off the reason the course that you bought didn't make you money is
(00:59) oftentimes because the thing that the course taught is not the only thing that is required to make money and so for example if i were to learn how to do math do i need to know how to do math in order to be good at business yes does knowing math make me good at business no it is a subset superset relationship do i need to know how to write copy to be good at business yes if i only know how to write copy will i make money no the reality is that in order to get the first dollar across the bridge it's much more important to see it as a
(01:35) bridge from where you are and where you're trying to go and each one of the bricks represents a skill that you'll need if you do not have one of the bricks you will not be able to continue to pass the difficulty in what most people have is that they continue to reinforce one brick and they still have a gap so it's like i take six different courses on copywriting but copywriting isn't the link that is broken in the bridge to get you from where you are to where you want to go and get that first dollar across or get the increase in
(02:02) dollars across because if you want to think about it differently think about it like a pipe and right now you've got let's say thick tubes for the vast majority of the pipe so you could have lots of water that's flowing here but then you have this tiny little tube over here because it's a weakness in the system and it affects the overall throughput from your entire business right you should think about business in my opinion like a pipe right you've got eyeballs over here and you've got uh money over here right it's
(02:28) everything that happens from eyeballs to headlines to ads to copy to clicks to conversions to sales to upsells etc all of that is just this process where eyeballs get turned into money and so if you can just shift your perspective from like i bought a course on copywriting or i bought a course on facebook ads or whatever it is and i didn't make money it's not because the course was bad maybe it was but that's not the point the point is that it's probably because you're missing another piece of the puzzle and that's why it takes so long
(02:56) for so many people when they get into the game and they get so frustrated at the beginning because everybody tells the story i bought all these courses didn't work for me and then i finally got this thing and then it all took off but many times that last course was just the last piece of a bridge that other people helped you build and i think that if you can shift that perspective you'll stop a having such negative you know views around some of the earlier teachers in your life and then you'll also be able to just spot
(03:22) the gap in your learning and then attack it ruthlessly and i think that's one of the things that most people don't do is they just start continuing to learn about the things that they enjoy rather than continue to focus on the things that they lack now sure doubling down on your strength from a large perspective is a very good idea but the business as a whole especially if you're a solopreneur right or an entrepreneur who's starting out and only has a team of five maybe 10 people like the business has to do all
(03:46) of these things period so you can be you know skewed in a certain direction you might be better at acquisition you might be better at product maybe better fulfillment whatever it is right you might be better at those things than like learning about that stuff but in order for the business to be successful all of these roles have to exist and even if you don't want to specialize in it you still need to know enough about it to be dangerous so you can make a judgment on how good someone else is to make to know if they can fit into
(04:09) your business so i wanted to cover that first off the second thing is that for some reason and actually for some reason i'll tell you exactly what the reason is people get very upset about courses they buy on the internet and yet for some reason no one is upset about the fact that they took four years of spanish and can't speak a lick of spanish hmm why is that because of expectations it's all it is it's because of expectations they believe or maybe you believe i don't know that if you buy a course right that immediately you should be
(04:43) successful and i'm gonna be here to tell you that that's not true and that's because if you just show up at school i mean shoot some people enroll in classes and never show up is like if you enroll in a spanish class and never show up is the is spanish a scam probably not do you believe that it's possible that there are good students and bad students just like there are good teachers and bad teachers do you think it's possible that half of students are below average half of the people watching this might be below average
(05:12) hmm interesting and so if half the people that take an educational course are below average then it would be reasonable that half the people take a course will get bad results now a good teacher can shift that percentage and but the thing is is what ends up happening is it's a bell curve right and this is studied a zillion times over classes and humans exist in a bell curve and so a good teacher can move the bell curve one direction or other but they're still going to be the outliers in the front and the outliers on the back and so the
(05:40) reason that people get upset is because of the expectations they cast upon what they believe they're going to get and i think part of that's a fault of the marketing and the sales process etc and don't get me wrong i think there's definitely things that can be improved there but i think that you can try and wish and cast stones on those people um or you can just understand going into it that there's a responsibility that you would have as a student just like if you went to college to do a certain amount of stuff and the reason i'm bringing this
(06:04) up is because i genuinely am super passionate about education in general over half the companies our portfolio our education and training companies i believe in vocational type uh training stuff which is why you know our gym company is basically how to run a gym right and um you know companies that i like are like niche expertise type things like how to run an auto shop how to run a plumbing business like because that stuff doesn't get taught anywhere when i look at the educational system as a whole i think almost everybody
(06:29) watching this especially if you're in my channel we can agree that the education system as a whole has failed us you know learning about aztec literature probably isn't isn't going to serve us in the real world and so i think that the reason all of the e-learning is booming is because education has failed to keep up with the times and it's wildly overpriced the value to price proposition is one of the most laughable in the entire world they settled an entire generation with debt and no way to repay it you get to the end of four
(06:55) years you're 100 000 in debt and and you have literally no more skills that will qualify you for a job you can get the same jobs before and after a four-year degree it's nuts and so the reason that you know acquisition.com exists for us is so that we can hopefully you know my goal is to is to build the new world of education which is how people can actually get skills that can feed themselves and it was because i went to some of you guys may not may not know this but i went to vanderbilt um i graduated magnetic and bloody in three
(07:22) years so i was a good student i don't have the typical entrepreneurial journey of like teachers never understood me and like i i always messed around and couldn't pay attention like i didn't have that like i i worked really hard and i got good grades and despite that nothing that i learned at vanderbilt at all in any class was more valuable than any course i've ever bought in e-learning how crazy that is right like i've bought courses on freaking everything i bought courses on youtube ads ball courses on on copywriting i bought
(07:53) courses on sales i bought multiple courses on sales i bought i mean everything you can possibly imagine i bought mentorship or workshops i bought seminars all of these things if you were to spend the same hundred thousand dollars that you spent on a four-year degree versus spending a hundred thousand dollars on the in the e-learning community on the on the most vetted courses and go through them and give yourself four years to be successful if you compare the two people it's apples and oranges it's not even close
(08:15) in terms of income generation that they get in that same comparison which is why i'm so pro e-learning in general i wanted to hit on this because i think it's so important and this is why people get upset and they buy one course and they think i didn't make a million dollars and therefore all e-learning is bad which is just like such a poisonous thought that i just hope that if you're watching this you don't feel that way because you will like the moment you decide you don't want to learn in online it's the new world you don't even
(08:41) like i don't even know what to say like it's it's the new world and i make this channel so that anybody who who doesn't want to spend any money you can have access to everything i've courses for free at acquisition.com um i'm publishing 10 books and i'm giving them away at 99 cents because i can't give them cheap on amazon um so that everyone can happily and i made these as textbooks so that you can actually know like this is a this is how you make an offer right and this is how you can start your business um and start selling
(09:06) stuff anyways not not to go more into that but one your course didn't make you money because it's probably not the weak link in your chain number two you're probably upset about it because the expectations that you had was that if i buy this thing i will make lots of money and that's partially follow the marketing of the people who are selling the course so i'll agree with you there but overall if you remove that expectation there's lots of good stuff defining courses and i've and i've learned basically everything i know from courses
(09:30) and application one thing that i think is important is that if you were in a service business right or you are somebody who's trying to learn a skill like i said earlier you have to come a certain percentage the teacher has to come a certain percentage and the better the teacher the less skilled the student needs to be but at the end of the day if i take a course or i go into a workshop or i take you know do whatever i know because of who i am that i am going to get a return on my money because i will find something to learn i've learned from bad
(09:58) courses because i'm like these are things that i'm not going to do when i build my course and that has been valuable to me and so a lot of people just create themselves as victim and continue to play the story like woe is me you just gotta get over it because no one cares no one's gonna help you like only you are gonna help you if you keep telling yourself the story it's gonna it's gonna kill you let me give you a fun example if you've ever been to dairy queen and um i have which is delicious by the way for some reason let's say the girl at the
(10:24) front when she flips the thing flips your flips your dairy queen shake right the ice cream falls out because she does it bad right whatever do you then all of a sudden say screw you warren buffett in your terrible business one star or do you think it's possible that that employee is new the last piece that i want to say is um around judging others and it's kind of what i started with this thing was one of the guys who posted this thing said that someone else had told him bad stuff about me this is a rule so i'll try and share as many of
(10:58) the algorithms that that layla and i have developed in terms of making decisions which is we try and make if-then statements uh that we don't have to repeat decision-making processes because there's a lot of attention and time and energy to make decisions and so if you've made one then just boom that is an algorithm that if this than that and then you don't have to make it again and so it just makes your day faster and easier because you don't have any emotional effort so i'll give you one of our money ones which is no diligence no
(11:22) deal really simple right and if we don't both agree we don't move forward so there are simple things that we've done over time to just simplify our decision making process and so decision making algorithm i want to give you around people that i have is that if i don't know someone firsthand i don't make a judgment right and let me tell you a couple reasons why because there's there's a couple variables i think are worth exploring the first is that who here has thought to themselves when i look back on my own
(11:49) past i was an idiot i do all the time every day right and sometimes today i think yesterday was an idiot right and so if you think back to your past you're like man that guy was an idiot right he was so arrogant he thought he knew him so much how can i then assume that right now ten years from now i'm not gonna look at who i am now and think the same way and so i question me's judgment from five years ago i'm like man the perspective in which you saw the world was ridiculous first off me just me trying to just deal with my own variable
(12:18) of my own judgment is shaky at best right and so if i'm looking at someone i barely will cast a judgment because i i'm an idiot half the time and i know this because of how i know what i was 10 years ago and hopefully 10 years from now i'll feel the same way now now that's variable number one variable number two is that the person that you were listening to also is an idiot now compared to who they're going to be and they probably might be in a certain mood or they might have certain views about the world that are contrary to what i
(12:48) just brought up earlier and so they're like if i buy something it should immediately work now as business owners we want to take complete responsibility for that absolutely 100 bar none like our goal always should be a hundred percent of people who who do business with me get value and access to what they paid so much so that they want to tell their friends right that is always the goal and that is always the ideal that we have to charge behind because us blaming our customers is the stupidest possibly the stupid thing you could ever
(13:14) do because it does not improve your business at all you get you get no benefit from blaming your customers but as a customer you have to understand because if you're a winner you'll notice that winners are just taking responsibility for both sides of the equation right and so if that person right that that you're getting the judgment from isn't a winner and they have stories that they tell themselves and they might be an idiot now compared to who they're going to be in in x amount of years that if they tell you so and so
(13:42) how many times you've heard there's two sides to a story the more you get around the business game right like there's always going to be another side of the story and so i would have judgments that i would cast on people earlier on that prevented me from doing deals with people that i now know and i was like i can't believe i didn't have this person in my life for five years because of some post i saw it was so ridiculous i gave this post more power than my own ability to make judgments as on another person i guess the moral of the story is
(14:09) if i'm not close enough to know someone and actually have conversed with them then i'm not going to cast a judgment you know the amount of people who who go nuts on the fact that i i paid grant 30 grand for an hour by the way i paid 120 grand for four hours was actually what it was and that was just the first hour but so if anyone wants to go even more nuts about it but the point is is that like everyone there most people i would bet have never actually met grant and so they cast judgment without knowing who he is
(14:36) and i think that even if you don't like someone and i'm not saying that grant is perfect or by any stretch of the imagination my god the man has demons so do i you miss all of the gold that people can provide you in your life by writing off an entire person i think people are made up of lots of things or complex beings sometimes you have good days sometimes you have bad days and if someone meets you on your bad days you're like i was having a bad day but that's just the judgment that they have hopefully you're getting the idea here
(15:05) that there's so many variables that it makes it virtually impossible to cast judgment on someone unless you have some sort of direct relationship with them and even then 10 years from now you're gonna think you're a right now hopefully if you grow and so i um i take 19 grains of salt i take pounds of salt with every one of the judgments that i have and i just try and think to myself like is what i am getting from this person valuable is there something that i can learn of this person rather than this person is good
(15:32) or bad and i think that a lot of times we like to create binary judgments this person is good this person is bad rather than the fact that people exist on multiple continuums this was a uh hopefully a perspective shifting video that i was inspired to make because of the pose that i was tagged in i just hope that everyone can take a quick second before you know if you if you buy something buy it and understand that it probably won't be the the one link that you were missing if it is then that's the thing that creates this crazy
(15:58) breakthrough but oftentimes it's just one of the many bricks that has to be built on the way to where you're trying to go and understanding that we're responsible and that that teachers and students have a have a two-sided relationship the better to the teacher the less bad the student is but half of people are below average right and like i said half the people listening to this are below average so think about that for a second and then when we cash judgment on other people is it really worthwhile or is it maybe more useful to
(16:22) say i hate this person but they're better than me in these ways and i can learn of them from that and so that has been some of the some of the useful shifts that i've had as an entrepreneur that have provided a tremendous amount of value to me in my life and have helped me move past things both emotionally where i didn't get you know an ideal experience instead of holding on to this poison just letting it go because and now at this point i don't really experience the poison because i just don't have the expectation and so i
(16:50) think that the more aware we can become this is just me talking the more aware i can become of my own expectations the more uh honestly the happier i am in life because uh i don't really create a lot of room for myself to get let down because i'm not expecting anything it leaves room to be pleasantly surprised so anyways if this provided value to you if this video was a pleasant surprise hopefully or shifted some perspectives hit the subscribe button i can't wait to see you in the next video lots of love and uh for those who don't
(17:17) know us my name's alex for mozy i own a portfolio companies call in acquisition.com right now we do about 85 million a year um the whole goal is that i'm trying to create a billion dollar portfolio and recreate the middle class in america and uh i'm gonna do it one video at a time so keeping awesome lots of love and i'll catch you soon bye

Transcript:
(00:00) if you understand the steps that I'm about to share with you in this video you will be able to step by step create a fortune if you don't know who I am I cross $100 million net worth when I was 32 we have a portfolio at acis.com that is $200 million a year took me way too long to learn how fortunes are built if you imagine the amount of people that you have sold in your lifetime in whatever business you have whatever it is side hustles gigs anything and you were to instead add up all of them together and then they continue to pay
(00:26) you month over month over month at whatever price you sell stuff at how much bigger would your business be if it were mine a lot bigger my first big business was called gym launch gym launch to date has 5,000 brick and mortar gyms that have purchased the licensing from it if I had 5,000 of those gyms still paying right now that company would be worth over a billion dollar that company is probably worth now close to about 100 million so I've missed out on about $900 million during my career just from that one company
(00:54) alone because it took me so long to learn what I'm about to share with you the big problem that most people have when they starting their business is that they are in the selling business not in the reorder business they don't have recurring Revenue they have onetime sales when you see these merch drops and these things where people are just selling crap and they get the onetime purchase and no one buys again the reason they can't make money is because they have no compounding vehicle what that means is that if I sell somebody
(01:21) today I want to get credit for that person that I sold today in a year because what happens is if you don't have that then you're always selling for tomorrow you're always selling for the paycheck this month you're always selling to pay rent rather than benefiting from a sale you made 10 years ago and having that person still pay you today because the thing is that you need to harness time the people who understand wealth understand time if time is a liability against you it means you were thinking like a poor person for
(01:45) the wealthy time becomes an asset because the longer you wait the more you win and if you imagine a business as a wall of glue and you're blowing people at it if you never even increase the amount of people you sell let's just say you sell one person a week in 10 years you could have 500 customers every month who pay you and if you have any price point that is reasonable that is a lot of money that is a fortune and the reason people don't have that happen is because they don't get it and they're only thinking about the short sale for
(02:16) tomorrow the easiest question that I like to ask when we're analyzing one of the businesses that we're thinking about purchasing and is there a way that we can get someone to buy this and never stop paying for it is there a way that we can make this so good the moment their card changes or they get a new credit card they call us ahead of time because they don't want to stop receiving value if your phone gets changed your phone carrier and your credit card goes out what do you do you call your phone Carry and you replace it
(02:39) because the value is there if your credit card goes out what do you call Netflix you're going to make sure that your car goes through if your utilities go out because your car doesn't go through you [ __ ] pay it if your rent doesn't go through you make sure that it's paid on time because these are things you cannot live without the goal is to figure out a way to make our value so high that people don't want to stop paying you want to be in the reorder not the order business there are recurring Revenue businesses and reoccurring
(03:05) Revenue so this applies whether you have a subscription business or you have a one-time purchase business the point is that people come back Facebook is a massive company they do not have a recurring Revenue model they have a reoccurring Revenue model meaning I go to the Facebook store today I buy some eyeballs and tomorrow I might go back again and buy more eyeballs I don't have a subscription but I reorder over and over and over again the question that I ask the portfolio companies that when we're trying to grow them early on and
(03:33) really get the product to be exceptional is if tomorrow you could not Market anything you could not get any new customers whatsoever and the only thing you had were the customers you have today and any new customer that you get could only come from referral and word of mouth of the people you have right now how differently would you treat them how different would their experience be and how much better would your product be if the only way you could get new customers was them sending new business your way when you start thinking like
(03:58) that you start thinking like the wealth not like the poor who are always in a rush for the next sale the next paycheck because the reality is you don't get customers to make sales you make sales to get customers it's an important distinction we only transact in order to create the relationship so that we can have Revenue again and again and again you want that customer to exist like a node of Revenue in your business that pumps money your way month after month after month so the big issue is that the stuff that most people sell sucks
(04:27) they're constantly focused on promotion they're constantly trying to find the next customer because they haven't confronted the real issues that you're just not that good and that's okay but the problem is that you're not focusing on the hard work which is getting better there are three steps that you look at when you're actually trying to scale a business you want to go to zero to a million make a couple million bucks a year you can just promote and sell [ __ ] all day long and never build real wealth for me I want to build a fortune and the
(04:49) only way to build a fortune is to get people to never stop paying you if that is our goal we only need to learn how to promote as much as we just need people to start trying our product the point of making the first sales is to get customer customers the point of those first customers is to give you feedback and you keep getting feedback and not even caring too much about how hard you're marketing because the goal is to get the product and service better and better and better and this is why most people can't scale because they start
(05:15) selling a little bit and say oh I should promote even more but the problem is they never fix the product they keep selling more and more [ __ ] and then what happens is if you sell 100 people this month you have to sell 100 people next month just to maintain and then the month after that if you bump to 200 new sales a month then the next month you have to sell 200 just to maintain but if you have 10 customers a month and they never leave you in 5 years you have 600 customers a month that are paying you only with 10 new customers a month when
(05:42) you get customers who do not leave you you can afford any marketing you can afford to outspend everyone there's a company that we're about to make a huge investment in and right now their lifetime value per customer compared to their competition is 10x and their cost to acquire customer is the same as their competition who's going to win in a bidding auction for who can buy the next customer on Facebook or YouTube or pay for the eyeballs between them and their competitors they win every time because when you get that right everything else
(06:11) is easy step one is you promote just to get people to become customers promote it so that you get the first C which is consumption the second piece is that actual Improvement Loop what happens is when their business gets hard when they hit a plateau when people can't grow anymore they do one of two things they start marketing more which is crazy cuz it means just more people find out about the stuff that you sell that sucks or they create another product if people don't consume your product people don't consume your service it's not that
(06:39) they're numbnuts it means that you suck means you have created such a difficult experience for someone to interact with you made it so difficult for someone to onboard that they never even experience the benefit the amount of people that I hear especially in the in the Internet space who are like oh these people don't work hard they never follow through does Amazon complain about all the service tickets they get no because they fixed the products they spent the time to keep solving problem after problem after
(07:04) problem until there were almost no problems left with the product taking full responsibility and saying you know what we can make this better and the way you do that is through surveying the customers to figure out what you can do better looking at their client experience looking at the results seeing if you can make it happen faster seeing if you can make it happen easier making sure that you've added so much value that there's no one else that they can compare your product to you keep doing the feedback loop on those customers
(07:30) until you get a product where people are referring business to you to add the cherry and sprinkle on top you make it harder to leave and if you're in a B2B situation you want to add in collateral or controlling the money flow if you work with stripe they probably process your money they control the money flow they don't worry about decline cards cuz they collect your money for you up front the person who controls the money has leverage and then once you crack that once you say I'm only going to sell so that I make sales to get customers I'm
(07:56) going to continue to improve and iterate the same product over and over and over again until the point where I have so many people who are coming to me because of how good it is then I put gas on it and spend as much money as I can on the marketing because now I can outspend everyone in the same Marketplace I'm making 10 times a 100 times more than my competitors because when people buy from me they don't want to stop but most people do it in reverse they sell as many as they possibly can burn all the Goodwill they
(08:22) have and then come out with another product put a lots of hype around it sell a bunch of them and then do it again and again but they cannot build a compounding vehicle of Enterprise Value because if every single launch if every single customer that they had sold for the last 10 years were still paying them today they would have more money they know what to do with it's not about the price in an absolute term it's all relative to the value that someone receives so if someone's price is here and the value deliver here you can make
(08:45) this price whatever you want if this price is a million and they get 10 million of value they will pay you for it price is what you pay value is what you get what we want is a customer Surplus we want an insane deal we want a bargain that people do call ahead of time to make sure that they never stop getting bills the game is saying hey I've got a $500,000 house I'll sell it to you for 50 Grand and I learn how to build it for 10 even if you provide more value up front and it's less profitable that's okay because then through the
(09:10) iterations that you have of getting better you get more and more efficient and you can drive down your costs while also increasing the value and maintaining your brand and reputation this lesson took me 7 years to really internalize cuz when I looked back at my own customer list and I saw 5,000 locations on there I was like I would have a billion dollar business if I had taken more time up front to figure out how to never lose people

Less is More: The Magic of a Simple Business - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:01) Catch tough right now. Catch much easier. So this one idea will change how you think about business. It's keep simple but not the way you think. Fundamentally it's about how to make a more profitable business and doing this from the top down from a strategy, marketing, sales, product delivery perspective.
(00:22) And I want to take you through an exercise first and then I'll talk about it afterwards. Let's imagine that I have a marketing campaign and I want you to understand some of the benefits of my services or my product, right? So, I might have four different benefits that I think are really, you know, really material that I want someone to know.
(00:39) Okay? And so, the problem is the vast majority of marketing looks like this. Ready? One, two, three. Catch. Well, it's very hard to catch all four at the same time. But if I just said, "Hey, real quick, I want you to understand something. catch, you'd probably be able to catch that. And so, it's a great visual analogy for the value of a simple message.
(01:01) Ken Seagull, who wrote the the book uh Insanely Simple, talks about this when he was in his meetings with Steve Jobs, and that was an exercise that he took the marketing team through. Whenever they'd want to start saying multiple points, it would he knew that it would eventually devolve into every single thing under the sun that we could possibly say about this thing, which meant that we hadn't done enough strategic thinking around what is the one thing that matters most.
(01:23) And so the saying that they live by, which I really love, find the most compelling point and communicate it in the most compelling way. I'll say that again because I think it's so important. You focus on the one most compelling point and then you communicate it in the most compelling way.
(01:37) A thousand songs in your pocket, right? It's, I think, a discipline that has to be taken pervasively from the top down. It has to start with the business owner, has to start with the CEO, has to start with the founder, whoever person is calling the shots in terms of what we're doing as a business. Because this level of simplicity, right, takes more work than complexity.
(01:55) And that's what's crazy about it is that complexity is less work than simplicity. Because complexity is typically the child of lazy thinking. We can't prioritize. We're not sure which one of these four things is most important. So, we'll just say them all. We have these four features. Rather than limit it to one and then make that one better, we're just going to see all four because we want to appeal to all sorts of different people.
(02:18) But most really big business ideas, in my opinion, are the opposite of what you would naturally do. Because if what people's natural instincts led them to do were the things that made businesses successful, then most people would have successful businesses. And that's anything but true. And so it's the constraint of fig of forcing yourself to say no.
(02:37) There are three things here. There is one of these that is more important. And we have to keep whittling it down or chunking up the language such that this one point is the most compelling. And you're thinking, okay, well, maybe this is just only applies to marketing, right? No, it has to go all the way through. Cuz think about it.
(02:50) If you figure out that this one core promise or core feature, right, is the most important thing. Then that informs our product strategy. What features are we going to build? What services are we going to deliver? And if we only have one to do, wouldn't we spend so much disproportionate amount of time trying to make that thing exceptional? Like you look at Raising Canes, right? The chicken shop.
(03:10) They have seven ingredients on the menu. like they arguably couldn't have fewer ingredients in order to make a meal. They've got toast, they got fries, they've got chicken tenders and then they've got sauce and beverages. There's six and there's one more. I can't remember what it is, right? And so I think kleslaw or something like that.
(03:23) But anyways, point being they could like someone saying, "Hey, have you considered adding an eighth item?" Yeah, they probably thought about it. But the ability to say this is what matters most. If we only did this one thing, would we accomplish all of our goals? And I think it's one of the most powerful questions.
(03:38) Frank Frank Slutman who wrote the the book Snowball talks about this one thing where he says a lot of companies will take you know they'll have five objectives and 10 five subobjectives and and they go into subobjective you know nightmare right he says if we cannot say what the one thing that's most important in the business then the job of the CEO that CEO has failed and I'm guilty of this too so I'm not saying this is not me saying this from a pedestal this is me uh you know this is me trying to document my own thinking rather than say this is a
(04:03) sermon is that what one thing if it were true 12 months from now would change everything for our business. And what's interesting is that when you ask that question, like what one thing would have to be true? Like if we had a dedicated lead channel that we owned, that one thing would change everything.
(04:18) If we just had a great supply of talent for our HVAC company, for new technicians, if we just did that by the end of the year, it would change everything for us. If we were just able to to to pull cash flow from 90 days to to 30 days uh for each sale that we do, that would change everything for us.
(04:35) Thinking about that as the what must be true then becomes the most important business objective because you might have objective 2 3 4 5. But if you just did one then it likely makes 2 3 4 5 1 irrelevant. Two by the time you accomplish number one 2 3 4 5 might have changed because you will now have new resources and new assets at your disposal.
(04:56) And so you're basically trying to make a decision about variables before the board has changed from the decisions that you're ultimately trying to make. And one of the difficult parts and this is the this is the really nefarious one. Once you make that one simple decision like this is the priority, this is what we're doing.
(05:12) All systems go every department seeks to make this one thing true about our world so that it relates back to this business. Sometimes solutions take time. Sometimes you have to sit with the pain of an unbuilt bridge without building a second bridge. So let's say you know that like let's use the technician example. You're like man we got the phone's ringing off the hook.
(05:30) I could expand my practice. I could expand my XYZ if I just had more talent to deliver, right? Well, if you're in that boat, you know, once you've realized that, you might kick off some sort of recruiting search. You might kick off some sort of community or some sort of play where you get referrals from all these different networks uh that would generate technicians for you or internships or whatever, right? But the thing is is one month in that still might not really have happened as in like you might not have this over you
(05:53) this overflow of new talent in the business, right? But you know that if that one thing were true 12 months from now, that's the only thing that matters. And so the hardest part and this is a lesson I'm kind of making this public so that me sticking with it too is that sometimes you have to let the little fires burn is that like you could and like we sometimes do and this is I'm guilty of this.
(06:12) I will kick off a real meaty solution to a big thing. Like if we do this, this the only thing we have to do and we'll crush it. But then because I'm impatient in a human being, I'll be like it's, you know, it's 30 days later and I'll be like, oh my god, it's not solved yet. And then I'll want to try and solve it another way.
(06:25) When in reality, me trying to solve it in two or three ways ends up just pulling resources from the one way that I know will work but will take time. And so I would rather take the sure bets on the thing that has the absolute highest leverage impact on my business rather than many small bets that might or might not work because the thing is is like this is the death by a thousand paper cuts.
(06:46) And so it's it's that that one thing that then also simplifies what everyone's doing. So this is a absolute highle strategy thinking process. But what's really fascinating about this is and so they talk about Steve Jobs. He has this great comparison between art of western and eastern art. And you're like, where's he going with this? I'll explain.
(07:06) So, western art when they when most people imagine like creating art, they think of a blank canvas, right? Or a blank document. And so, then what you do is you add to that document, right? What's interesting is that the Eastern philosophy is opposed to this. So, they think of it as like you have this big slab of jade.
(07:22) And so, all we're doing is removing the excess to reveal the art or the sculpture underneath. And so, it's the difference between Eastern and Western philosophy. And as it applies to business, it's kind of the same way, which is like when you delete everything that sucks about a phone with what remains is an iPhone. And so I think about that with services a lot because a lot of times it's so easy to just say like, okay, well, I'm going to add more to the canvas, right? But when you when you think about it from from pulling things away, it's like what are all the
(07:48) distractions that I'm creating internal my business, but also to my customers? Because you think about that that that that crumple of paper, right? If I say, "I'm going to help you with this one thing," then just help with that one thing. That's it. And Jack Dorsey says this, and I love this quote.
(08:06) He says, "Perfect every detail and limit the number of details." It's so elegant. Like, if you're going to do it, do it well. And the vast majority of things you can't do. This has been such a a struggle for me for my entire career because the more capable you get, the more resources you have at your disposal, the more opportunities present themselves, the more the harder it is to consistently say no.
(08:31) Jobs also said, "Focus is the the number of amazing ideas that you say no to." Right? I'm just as proud of the things we did as the things we didn't do, is one of his famous quotes. And so, the idea that they liked saying over and over again was amazingly simple and simply amazing. How do we just think like, I'm just gonna make one sandwich.
(08:48) And if I just make this one sandwich to be the best sandwich in the city, I will probably have lines out the door. I don't need to have 20 sandwiches because if I just make this sandwich the best sandwich, and I think about it from the the experience of someone eating it, the experience of them waiting for it, the experience of them ordering it, how I source the ingredients, how those are going to get combined, at what temperature, in what order, right? who's going to be the one providing them? how like what are the price points in like
(09:09) all of these types of things are it's the obsession on the details but we're limit because you can't go deep if you have too many things and fundamentally that's the problem is like myself included we all have too many things going on and you just can't go that deep when you're spread too thin and the thing is is that all of the outsized returns come on the end of the curve right so it's like you do this work do this work do this work and it's only when you're like okay I'm I'm at the 50% mark meaning I'm like about average,
(09:36) right? And you're at the 75% mark. You're above average. You maybe do a little bit better, right? But not not that much better. You're at the 90% mark. Okay, now we're starting to see it. But the difference between 90th percentile, 95th percentile, boom. Between 95th and 99, boom. In terms of who captures the market, who's the one that people just can't help but say good things about you, right? And so I just think about what are these need to believes? What are the things that if I if I just did one thing, and if you're
(10:00) thinking about this, you're like, well, there's a lot of things that if I did this, it would grow my business. We're not thinking increments. We're thinking orders of magnitude. So yes, if you improve your sales close rate, you would your business would grow. If you bumped your, you know, margin by certain percent, your business would grow.
(10:12) If you if you increase your lead, sure, the business would grow. But I'm not talking about those improvements. Those are what I consider the sausage making a business. That's the daily. That's the in-n-out. That's just like how you run a business. I'm talking about what are the orders of magnitude changes, the bets that we're going to make with our additional resources.
(10:26) Because fundamentally, let's say you've got, you know, a hundred people who work for you. It could be 10, it could be one, doesn't matter. The point is that you have x amount of people work for you. Maybe they're at 70% utilization or 80% utilization. They've got a little bit little bit of bandwidth on top of the sausage making they have to do every day to keep the keep the trains going.
(10:41) So you have to scoop that little 20 30%, right? And you have one real bet that you can make on it. And so it's like you want to make that bet worth it. What's interesting is like how do you how do you come up with these ideas, right? And so I think this level of like how do we just remove everything that doesn't matter? And I trying to reverse my thinking process this way.
(10:59) This is a lot like um Munger's uh invert like okay if I wanted to destroy my business what would I do? Like it's a really powerful frame. This is a different frame which is how much can I take away and still have it be good and not only be good but it probably is better. And so I'll give you a real world example.
(11:15) Uh in the school games uh we we basically used to have more calls that we did and we had more stuff that we put in the community. We had like three a week and then we also had like content was getting dumped in there and basically the number one reason that people were cancelling was overwhelm.
(11:31) It was not oh I need to provide more value. It was I need to provide more value per second in fewer total seconds. And so rather than say, okay, so what we did was we removed two of the three calls, except kept it to one and we moved the big download from once a month to once a quarter so that people could get on top of it, right? And we removed some of the things that were native and turned on inside of the app so that people would have fewer things to do when they got in.
(11:57) So they were like, "Oh my god, there's so many things I have to do. I can't think about it." And then they leave, right? And so we want kind of like you want to like you only introduce something when it's required or necessary for that person to get the the desired value rather than say here's all the different things you can do.
(12:11) It's like well why don't we just do this one thing that most people find valuable first and then perfect that step and then once we've done that maybe we'll show the next step. If you're actually subscribing to this this ideology, which is something that I'm really trying hard to I'd say like the inversion process is how I've made a lot of strategic decisions and I'm also thinking more and more often with this this frame of one, which is if I can't decide what the one most important thing is, then I'm not doing my job and I need to think about it longer because the
(12:36) thing is is that one provides more efficiency than just about any strategy. You want to cut costs, you want to improve your margins, do one thing. There's way fewer things to do. And if you do one thing, you also need to have way fewer meetings about it because there's only one thing. And when you have just one thing, you don't need to have lots of people at the meetings.
(12:54) You just have a very small group of very smart people. And fundamentally, that's how these projects start to get organized. And the easiest way to screw up a project like this is to give it too much time. And so if it is simple, you can also do it faster. So you could say in 12 weeks and it doesn't what's crazy about this is that you can do projects even at like huge company levels in 12 weeks because you have more resources, right? And so just thinking what is the one thing that matters most? If I'm not sure, what are all the things that I can
(13:24) delete away and have it still be valuable? And if I do know what that one thing is, how deep on that one thing can I go? Because if I made this one thing true at the end of the year, all of my other problems would shrink into irrelevance. They would no longer matter. It makes the the noise go down. But the thing is is that you have to subscribe to this philosophy through and through.
(13:41) Like you have to believe in it balls to bones because you think you're overwhelmed. I promise your team's 10 times more overwhelmed because they don't know what direction you're in because you're changing it all the time because you have so many different conflicting priorities. And so having this focus of one is easy to communicate.
(13:56) People remember it because it's only one crumpled piece of paper, right? It's easy to sell because it's one thing and you can just make that point as compelling as humanly possible. When you're delivering on product or services, you just perfect that one result, that one deliverable. A lot of marketing agents just expand and expand and expand their breath of like what they do.
(14:15) All these different services they tack on, tack on tack on. Right now, if you're in an enterprise value business, those companies, if you're serving Fortune 100, it's a little bit of an use case there because for them, the one thing is full integration, right? like that would be the chunked up one thing for that business, right? If they actually had one person that could globally support their business, then that would be the one big thing we try and solve for, right? Um but many businesses, it's like if you just got them leads consistently, they would be
(14:39) happy. Like you don't need to offer these other other services, the other quote value benefits, because if you just did the one thing that mattered, they wouldn't care about anything else. And I remember there was this moment in gym launch when we had um a handful of gym owners reach out and say, "Hey, can we hop on a call?" And I said, "Sure.
(14:55) " and uh you know we're like hey we're trying to improve the product blah blah and they just like cut us off and they were like we just need leads like just more leads that's it like if you just give us more leads we'll be happy and so it was one of those like you know it's it's uh it's the economy stupid right it's kind of like the present like if you just fix the one thing that matters and if I'm if it sounds like I'm hammering this a lot it's because I'm hammering it into my own brain and if you think of like if you were to
(15:19) deconstruct this like I love this little quote of uh to achieve great things two ingredients are needed a plan and not enough time. And so it forces you to prioritize so that you can actually do the things that matter most. And I think that this is something that I'm trying to artificially do.
(15:34) You see like Elon talk about this for those you hate Elon just pretend he's cool for this conversation. Um you're also wrong. Anyways, point being, if you see the rate of innovation that they're able to do across the companies that he owns, a big part of it, he talks, is accelerating timelines, which is making unreasonable goals because the unreasonable goals create a forcing function for performance.
(15:55) And this has also been uh Brian Chesy talks about this from Airbnb. There's a bunch of other Y cominator founders who talk about this where they're like, if you want to speed up something happening, number one, big public goal, number two, make it really aggressive on timeline. Number three, check up frequently. Number four, remove people who shouldn't be on the project because they just create more communication cycles and more waste and more people to talk and and get, you know, approvals from.
(16:22) Fundamentally, you have to make bets and sometimes you just have to let people go as in like let them work, let them cook, right? Because if you get out of their way, a lot of times if you have a clear goal, clear objective, you're checking in regularly, you don't need to do much more than that.
(16:36) And so this is something that I'm half shouting at myself um as a reminder of the few things that matter most. And if I do not have that one thing for my team, then I have failed, not them. So that is my insanely simple. It's been top of mind because I I just read a couple books that mention jobs recently.
(16:50) It's been really valuable for me. And so when I'm thinking about my own marketing campaigns, I'm like, what is the one most compelling thing I can bring up? And how can I say that one thing in the most compelling way? Hey, if you enjoyed this, uh, I had one of my best presentations of all time where I talk about how to accelerate how you get to your goals, whether they be financial, physical, whatever, um, by focusing on leverage.
(17:11) And so, it's the the first real presentation I made after basically getting into this whole YouTube world. Um, and it was just kind of like compiled from years of me thinking about wealth creation. And if that's at all interesting to you, you can click and watch it here. And dry.

Giving Away Free Stuff Will Make You Rich - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NMH1oAkgLY

Transcript:
(00:00) you're not making as much money as you want to make because you're not getting as many leads as you need to have to sell stuff to and you're probably not getting as many leads as you need because you're not giving away enough free stuff and this is a sneak preview of my 100 million leads book just a snippet from just one chapter and at the end I'm going to give you a seven point checklist that you can use to immediately deploy this in your business so you can get more leads and also make more money for Less the reason people
(00:24) buy is based on a prediction of future value so they buy because they predict that they will get value from you later what is the easiest way to get someone to predict they're going to get value from you after you buy by giving them value before they buy there's two ways that you can fundamentally get leads you can one just make your offer to somebody and say hey I will wash your car for a hundred dollars now you can put lots of Razzle Dazzle around it that is a offer products or services that you exchange money for and the terms under which you
(00:51) do that exchange and so this is directly from my first book 100 million dollar offers or an Espanol [Music] sorry a core offer versus a league man what's the difference right because fundamentally you'll have something that's valuable in both of these instances the core offer is the thing you sell that makes you the most money if you're like which one is it the one that makes the most money that's your core offer then all of a sudden you start making more money on your lead magnet guess what that's actually your
(01:12) core offer lead magnet is the thing before the thing lead magnet is not a partial solution all right what a lot of people try and do is like hey I'm gonna give you the first six minutes of this 12 minute video and get the rest click here right I think that's that's not the right way to do it I think you lose trust and that's literally the opposite of the objective of lead magnetic a lead magnet is a complete solution to a narrowly defined problem if you're gonna do anything for a customer there are many micro steps that happen to create a
(01:38) bigger solution let's say I paint houses there's a lot of micro steps that have to happen in order for a house to get painted first you've got to size up the house then you have to give an estimate of whatever then you have to do the design component and you have to do the 3D visualization the bigger the thing is the more steps there are the idea is okay can I pick one of these very painful steps for my Prospect and solve it for them at a massive discount to attract more people to want to do it with me and I do such a good job at this
(02:02) massive discount that I increase the trust they have with me and now they have one foot in the door we're not giving away partially done work we're giving complete work to a narrowly defined problem that once completed opens up the next problem for example you do massage and you're like I can't get enough massage clients well it's usually because you're not giving enough free stuff away because fundamentally if you give something away for free you almost always have demand for it and if it's good you'll have exponential demand
(02:30) for it if I give away a 10 massage to get people to come in and then later everyone buys packages of massages from me or buys a massage subscription from me the massage subscription or the massage packages are my core offer and the lead magnet would be the trial offer of the 10 or discounted massage the reason people do those discounted massages they give those trials they give those Mini offers the lead magnets on the front end is because they they make more money because if I go up to 100 people and say hey let me give you a
(03:01) massage for 100 bucks a lot of people might say no maybe one person would say yes now if I then said to the same other people I want to give you a massage for ten dollars I might get 20 people to say yes and then of those 20 get a third of them to buy the hundred things after they tried my massage and so you've got one person getting a massage for a hundred dollars versus six people getting a massage thirty percent of the twenty after giving them that first trial and so my cost to acquire them is the cost of delivering the lead magnet
(03:28) so if it cost me ten dollars in cost to give the massage then I break even on my lead magnet if it actually cost me 20 I might lose 10 bucks but am I willing to lose 10 bucks on 20 people so I pay 200 to get six customers that convert and are worth two thousand probably even if your lead magnet costs you money to deliver it should still lower your total cost to get a new customer that's the secret that's the sauce of lead magnets and why they ultimately make businesses more money and why big business owners think long
(03:57) term about I'm willing to give more up front because I know I'll make more in the end you might be wondering why I just caught a football it's because I'll be hosting the Super Bowl of Entrepreneurship on Saturday August 19th where I'll be releasing my new book 100 million dollar leads the second book in the series after its Big Brother 100 million offers which is 15 000 five stars on Amazon sold at 400 000 copies off word of mouthful and the only reason I'm making an ad is because I talk about ads in the book and I want to prove that I know
(04:21) what I'm doing if that sounds at all interesting and you want to be there but you would why would you not want to go to the Super Bowl click the link opt-in I'll see you there a lot of people get really afraid of giving away free stuff because if I give away all this value then what do I do it's like give more value and if you don't know how to give two types of value then get good enough to be able to give value on the front end before someone buys so they can get value on the back end one of the beautiful things about business and life
(04:41) is that when you solve problems you create more problems if you're broke being broke sucks when you have money taxes also suck now you may prefer those problems but they are problems nonetheless what we want to do is always know what the Journey of the customer is going to be ahead of them and we should because we're the ones who've done this 100 times and so we should know what next problem is going to come up and if we put our thinking caps on we say hey well if there's six steps to this problem why don't I solve the first two
(05:05) and then they're going to counter problem three and then I make that my paid thing now I completely solve problem one and problem two but it naturally leads itself to problem three which I can then charge for so for example if you're trying to lose weight there's a lot of steps that have to occur and the way that I like to think about this is before during after for everything that has to happen for a customer so a customer wants to lose weight then they're going to probably have to eat better work out better and
(05:29) they'll probably need some sort of help along the way in terms of accountability to keep them on it right eat better but what does that mean well they're going to have to buy their groceries differently prepare the food eat the food the food's gonna have to taste good they're gonna have to get the right macros it's like oh wow there's like a lot of little things here can I say hey how can I make grocery shopping easier here's a list here's a pre-loaded instacart grocery list for women who are at this weight women who wear it this
(05:52) way women who wear it this way men wear it this way with this goal right and you're like wait that's a lot of those it's like yeah but it's one time work that you can set up for a hundred different types of people and then they have their grocery list for you now that's just problem one What if after that what's the next problem they can have well they're going to bring it back and be like what do I do with all this [ __ ] how to clean and prep all of the food that you just bought in under 60 minutes and I'm going to solve it for
(06:14) them then what am I going to do well how to store it and Portion it in a way that you can bring it with you so you don't get that weird jelly in the bottom of your chicken breast Tupperware which is nasty as hell stay pumping there by the way uh to increase the weight if you solve them very well people are like oh [ __ ] but I also need this and you're like aha well I want me to tell you about that since you got such a good experience with this one and because I had value I will have a prediction a future value because you provided me
(06:37) value before I bought now one thing that a lot of people are afraid of giving away is stuff that actually costs them money but I can assure you that if it actually costs you money it usually will be valued at a significantly higher percentage to the marketplace so sure you can have a free pdf sure you can have a digital video series whatever it is but normally unless it's exceptional people aren't going to value that because that's what a lot of people do sometimes giving away actual free work that you will incur cost on a lot more
(07:02) people will take you up on and if you do the math you will ultimately make more money and this what I'm talking about it's the difference between small business owners and big business owners they can incur calculated cost Upfront for a much bigger back end your free stuff should be better than their paid stuff everyone makes that quote but they don't actually do that what your competition actually builds as their core offer and you do such a good job of it that you can give it away for free then you become Unstoppable and you're
(07:23) like wow that takes work duh also soda's becoming a multi-millionaire so did you think it would be easy let's round this out with the seven quick steps that I think through when I'm actually trying to create lead magnets for any business that we have step number one figure out the problem you want to solve and who you want to solve it for if you know who you're trying to solve it for you will name it differently you'll approach the problem differently you'll Market it differently you'll package differently and ultimately you'll deliver it
(07:45) differently if you're very clear on who and what number two is figure out how you want to solve it so inside the book I talk about three different ways that you can solve an actual problem for a lead magnet so one would be like if I give a free assessment of any kind I'm revealing a problem to somebody a different way would be giving a trial of something they are usually more problem aware they know their back hurts and so I just need to solve it for them but unless they keep paying me it'll come back and there's other versions and you
(08:09) can combine them which I talk about more in the book you figure out how you want to solve it the third step is figuring out how you want to deliver it there's lots of different delivery mechanisms do I want to do it with information do I want to do it with a service do I want to do the physical product that I'm going to send them that demonstrates it all of these are different ways to deliver on that one promise and the question is which of these is going to be perceived as the highest value from the Prospect and increase the likelihood
(08:29) that they ultimately buy for me the most that would mean that you get the most amount of people interested and the most amount of people taking the next step then it's like okay well how am I going to package this thing the first thing that someone's going to see in order to make the decision to consume your lead magnet is how you package it so for example this book I had the title that I tested I had the sub headline that I tested and I tested the image that I was going to put on the cover itself well the first test I ran was 100 million
(08:53) dollar advertising versus 100 million dollar promotions and advertising one 69 to 31 I was like huh so then I ran advertising against 100 million dollar leads leads one 58 to 42. I was like huh then next round I said okay 100 leads or 100 marketing and leads one again and so I was like all right well leads is going to be the headline of the book couple different images that I ran and then I ran different versions of the event that was the one that ultimately won and so there's a story of a book that uh that
(09:20) went out on on dating and it tanked and they went back and they changed the cover of the book and the headline nothing else inside the book and then it went on to sell over 10 million copies just by renaming the book you're gonna put all this time in delivering an amazing solution and so if there's ever a most important step it's this one which is how you name it and how you package it so step five is making it fast and easy to consume people learn in different ways have an audio version have a written version hardback version
(09:45) they can hold their hands have the digital reader version have the video version on my last book honeybellio offers which now is I think 350 000 copies sold so I have a decent data set it's almost a perfect quarter quarter quarter quarter split in terms of where people consume it it's so much effort to write the book and so little effort to just double and triple in quadruple how many more people consume it simply by making it available in more ways to more people in more places six is you have to make it [ __ ] good the reason I say
(10:13) that is because so many people give away sucky fluff in their lead magnets and their free [ __ ] and I use [ __ ] as the emphasis there because they're afraid or unable to give away more value if you're afraid of giving away more value consider the alternative you give away sucky fluff 99 of the marketplace only consumes your sucky fluff and makes a decision of how much value you're going to give to them in the future and they're going to say oh he gave me sucky fluff why would I ever work with him and then here's the shitty part they then
(10:37) other people are like hey do you know Jason so-and-so and you're like oh yeah I could tip one of his things it was [ __ ] and so what happens is not only did this person not buy they actually get other people to not buy yourself who otherwise would have you can reinforce your reputation in the marketplace by continuing to over deliver to people who will never give you money and that's okay because they know the people who will if a lead magnet is not good enough that people then tell other people about it in my opinion you have failed put 100
(11:02) into something if you've never put more than 10 put 100 in and see what actually happens to the quality of the work you put out in your audience will appreciate that because people can tell quality and step seven is that you want to make it easy for them to take the next step alright this is so important and people forget about it it's like we do all this work and we forget to make it easy for them to tell us that they want to buy more when you're making call to actions don't be clever be clear just say go to Amazon search my name and
(11:31) you'll find the book go to my website acquisition.com watch the videos be very clear about what you want the people to do and if you want give them multiple ways to do it it's the same concept as making multiple ways of consumption but making multiple ways for people to take action just like the book consumption you can double and triple your response rates on ctas by making it available in the way that is convenient to them is their preference some people like phones some people like typing in the URLs some
(11:56) people like scanning it just depends on the person and you want to make yourself available to all of them and believe it or not we covered about 20 of one chapter of this book I'm gonna have a big launch party for my book and if the book's already out either way it'll still be the same URL which is acquisition.
(12:10) com forward slash leads go there and it'll either be a training or there'll be a registration uh for the biggest event ever it's gonna be awesome I will do everything my power to overlive like crazy for everyone to attend so you can be there or be square

(00:00) success isn't fun um it's hard effort always goes end Noti get used to it you're good you you never bother us get it let us let us get it so there's this myth that probably happens with this influencer status of like we own businesses and businesses grow in like their last 3 months of Revenue have been like yeah so if you look at this here so what's been trending down as bookings so we're having Jesus yeah tldr kind took her eye off the B obviously was just down 60% of what it was yep but the thing about growth is that The Closer
(00:38) you zoom into it the more Jagged it looks and the more Jagged it feels you can feel the knife's edge of the up and the down and the up and the down every single day in this Vlog you're going to see me hop on a lot of calls and that's because that's what a lot of running our businesses is to Lea I nice to meet you nice to meet you too I mean you just you sprint from Air Conditioning to air conditioning hey what what Happ just cor roing it over here you know how it is hello you have two doors in your room it looks different it's clean now oh wow
(01:09) what's up man how's it going good congratulations on being you oh man congrats on being you I don't know how how a poor kid from Baltimore ends up in Vegas all right guys I'm going to go ahead and share my screen because of the proliferation of social media entrepreneurship appears to be the things that look nice so it's the private jets it's the cars it's the watches it's the money but the thing is is that all of those are outputs from business that people use for personal gain that then look attractive but the
(01:41) actual doing this every day of Entrepreneurship is predominantly communication it's talking to other leaders other employees teammates vendors customers and when you look at it on a real day-to-day of what that looks like it's a lot of meetings it's a lot of calls it's a lot of zooms and those don't look good on Instagram CU I've heard you talk about like paying for you know like knowledge or their expertise yeah at a certain point you actually stop being able to pay for expertise because when you start talking
(02:09) to people who have a shitload of money too like there's basically more valuable things than money to trade like that's where influence connections uh introductions you know deals things like that become a more valuable thing to discuss there's free communities there's paid communities there are benefits to both you know paid communities sometimes the the price tag is the gate to give you some level of qualifier of you know legitimacy like I mean even like you join a golf club where it's $100,000 a year to keep ling you're going to meet a
(02:40) caliber of people that don't care about spending $100,000 a year like it's a very different type of person have you just changed the five meals that you eat cuz like everyone thinks that they give up variety when they go on a diet they're like I can't just stick to this but people eat the same 5 to seven meals yeah so I put 20 pounds back on and so there's a key point there is I put it back on it wasn't like the first time I've been this way before um after the book launch and that was because actually going into the book
(03:03) launch um it was the longest period I think that I didn't work out I didn't work out for like 6 weeks most people eat the same five to seven meals and so they think that like changing their diet is going to have to be this massive thing but you really just need to find five to seven meals that you like because you currently already like five to seven meals and that's what you already eat and so you have to swap those for other stuff and if you just do that you're 80 90% of the way they are the older you get the fewer friends you
(03:25) tend to have and that's not because you're less social but it's because you have standards even then man Even though like my homiest of homies you can still like you just slowly stretch out communication then eventually just it just Fizzles like it's hard you have to maintain relationships so you just don't put the effort in to maintain it and then they usually just end like if you're not in close proximity that's the thing it's like most people's friendships are out of convenience they're not out of design and so they're just friends with
(03:54) people who were like lived across the hall from them but what is the chance that like the person lives across the hall from you is actually going to be a perfect fit for the type of person you want to be with for a long time probably not and so I think people let friends happen by accident rather than on purpose what would you consider like a a unicorn of a best friend like what traits would that they truly root for you and they make you better in multiple Arenas which is basically like they are competent in
(04:19) ways that you are not they have aligned interest with you and ideally their values align with yours that's a moment it's just very hard to do all three cont people what's happening uh we were going over a pricing issue for a software about to roll out in one of our larger portfolio companies and I think the one of the emphasis they did made the product not have a tenable pricing structure so we were able to catch it before they rolled it out which would have literally cost millions of dollars so we avoided that so great we got chops
(04:59) chops always smells good though though you notice that chops always yeah go for it yeah I'm going to get I'm going a little trim little chop I met Leila and I had short hair and she said I think you look good with long hair and I said okay and then I didn't cut it and so that was when my hair went from shorter to longer and it's pretty much just stayed there if you're an ugly guy you might want to consider growing a beard because it leaves half of your face to imagination so I had this the when we had gym launch uh this is right when we
(05:28) transitioned we right started making money and so remember we I had just been like looking at bankruptcy lawyers like a couple months earlier and so we have a a meet up of 28 gym owners that come to Alber cre New Mexico and I'm like super nervous because I'm afraid that they're just going to like think I suck or whatever right so the night before you know I was like trying to look nice and so I had Scruff and so I for all the guys who know this like you start shaving down and just like getting yourself in like different hair you're
(05:53) like all right I'm going to do the Wolverine and then I'm going to do mutton chops like you work your way down and so the last thing that I left was this this big Gunslinger mustache so like a big handlebar mustache and so I like looked out of the bathroom at LEL I was like hey um and she was like you look ridiculous and so I looked back in the mirror and I was like I think it's perfect and so uh uh that actually makes me sound cooler than I than I was what really happened is I when I looked in the mirror I was like well at least I
(06:19) won't take myself too seriously and so I figured that was that would like kind of get because I was so nervous going into it that I wanted to have some sort of comic relief for myself as like a visual reminder so I looked in the mirror I think everybody's got fuel it's just just not necessarily the one that is sexy so a lot of the guys out there are like find your passion find your purpose but I think for most people their purpose is like pay rent and not be broke and so like if that's what you got then that's what you use growth is
(06:42) painful because you become aware of your deficiencies reality shows you point blank all of the areas you're weak in and so when you've adjusted to something you've kind of filled the gaps you filled the holes between where you are and what is required for that current season but when you go into a new season or you go to a new level and you battle a new boss all of a sudden this guy has a whole host of different skills that you've never seen before and you just get your ass beat over and over and over again and those ass beatings hurt I mean
(07:09) every everybody has lots of things they hate like right now if I would ask you what are 10 things that you hate about your life it's probably you can come up with them pretty fast but if I ask you 10 things you're grateful for it takes a lot longer and so it's like rather than trying and get people to be different than who they are it's like find the 10 things you hate the most about your life and use that the reason use those as the reasons to to start working cuz I mean like whatever you're going to do is
(07:28) going to suck it's just whether it sucks less than what your current existence is and for me I had a lot of stuff that sucked and so I just wanted to change it's a nice backpack bro where's device cing up on um so the big thing that the internet doesn't understand is that like Leila operates acquisition.
(07:46) comom she's the operator she does everything she's CEO she actually is involved for the most part in the day-to-day of the business um I mean obviously I'll say hi to people you know around the office and whatnot any Shenanigans going on here no what was I going to ask you oh I was going to let you know um I brought the other half of the chair in oh awesome yeah I brought so it's right there where's toes solo cross the pond that is how we have found Lea and I work best together is I work on like big mey projects for extended periods of
(08:20) time that are huge rocks that move things forward and then Lea just like basically through force of will just keeps everyone on board everyone BL and continues to hire and train and and scale the business and that's what she's exceptional at I mean that's why we're able to build companies with such Enterprise Value so quickly is that she just understands building infrastructure behind things yeah I don't want to lose any mask going down those stairs yeah my dad told me he said he doesn't do cardio cuz he wants to save his heartbeats I was
(08:51) like check out sounds legit he's a doctor he's kidding he was joking that was a joke hanging you um I'm going to do this thumbnail and then I'll be Aude where are we headed we're going to uh ice coffee hour with graham Stefan and Jack Selby we're going to talk about iced coffee for hours now I don't actually I don't know what they want I don't know what they want to talk about cuz I've been on a couple times so I was like I hope I have something new to say so we'll find out cuz the thing is is that everyone is
(09:22) waiting for this like one home run that's going to like change everything and that basically never happens because it's all a game of incremental Improvement it's about small 1% improvements that add up over time and while you're making the improvements it never feels big it only feels big in retrospect and it looks like an overnight success from the outside because whoever sees the overnight success is never the person who experienced the overnight success because no one who actually is an overnight success would describe it as
(09:48) overnight because they always say you guys don't see the 10 years that it took me to get here I mean everyone wants recurring Revenue but no one wants recurring work and so it's this idea that everyone wants to just like get get get forever but no one wants to do do do forever and one doesn't come without the other and often times it's more like recurring work with zero recurring revenue for a very long period of time before you get your first far less amount of Revenue relative to the amount of recurring work you do I mean think
(10:16) about it until you win effort always goes unnoticed get used to it with whatever business you're getting into the more difficult is to get into the fewer entrance there will be so the less competition you have to compete against with the more barriers you have I'm always amazed at the amount of people who are like man this is hard and they somehow say that like it's a bad thing if it's hard good it means no one else will do it more for you like the hard the the level of difficulty that you have to go through in order to get
(10:47) whatever you want is literally the barrier that everyone else has to go through in order to achieve it too and so the bigger the goal that you have the bigger the obstacles that you have to get over which is why so few people will get it which is what makes it worthwhile to be begin with if it were obviously easy then everyone would do it and then it wouldn't be a goal because everyone would have it and right now it's not a big goal for people to breathe because everyone can breathe it's not a big goal for you to put your shoes on in the
(11:10) morning because everyone can do that and so therefore it loses its value what makes you exceptional is what you can do that other people can't do which means stomaching the harder thing is the thing that makes you the exception gr there we go what's up oh that's the uh mailbox oh where's the doorbell we're getting the doorbell move next week you're good what's up man I'm sweaty a little bit I'll give you one of these how's it going man H yeah nice to meet you pleasure pleasure you guys would make an amazing podcast together I
(11:40) have to say this would be a crazy conversation oh sweet super cool yeah but he's leaving right now for San Francisco oh fun therapy okay cool and they were out the mind that you thought the therapy wasn't very effective I'm a psychiatrist yeah yeah cool um and I was explaining to them that if you believe that therapy wasn't very effective you may be surprised because I'm inclined to agree okay well there you go then maybe we agree yeah I thought there would be a fun debate oh sure actually oh was four was a gift from you no no from Eric what
(12:12) is 1 hour of your time worth H I don't know I probably wouldn't do anything for less than 50 grand 50 Grand let's just say for if someone wants your advice 50 Grand an hour this if this podcast is 2 hours long yeah whoever's watching this is theoretically getting $100,000 of value just by listening to this so I just want to preface it by saying stick around for the episode you're getting a lot of value from this wow no that's fantastic no to the point that you might like why not make 50 million um I think that I
(12:47) want my brand to stand for something more than that and so I made it the mission to make real business education accessible for everyone and that is what I have been I have not wavered from that since I started doing this and I have two aspects to that one is like the distribution of how do I get this to everybody and how do I make it accessible and that has multiple levels to it which is one is like is it easy to understand but also like is it fun and entertaining and I'm getting better at that I think I'm I'm better at the easy
(13:12) to understand part I'm still working on how do I make this more entertaining so that like a stay-at-home mom will actually click and maybe get interested in something like this and maybe recommend her son or her daughter to like watch something like that I'm not there yet like but that's like in order for me to get that level of accessibility like I need to get better but on the flip side the context that the content is consumed within is basically my background so like at the very beginning you're like hey just for
(13:37) everybody who doesn't know here's this guy right if I had said hey I make $100,000 a year um listen to me I don't I mean I think fewer people would listen to me I mean maybe some would but like far fewer would listen to me as a quote Authority on on making money in general you can't have both growth and comfort one is the price of the other and so like if you're really comfortable it's probably an indication that you're plateaued that you're in the same space which then means that you have to voluntarily go into pain in order to
(14:10) come out the other side Better Stronger Faster

This Video Should be REQUIRED Viewing For Business Owners - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4twK8Yl4iUI

Transcript:
(00:00) this should be required viewing for business owners I'm going to explain a growth concept that every business needs and four tactics to get it come on follow me every business begins with effort and money from the founder or investors that begin the business from there you begin to get customers right so you advertise you sell and people come in the door and they buy your stuff now once customers come in they get some sort of result now after they get the result you then have some sort of reviews or Word of Mouth that that those results will
(00:39) generate and then that can then in turn get you more customers and so this initial effort of money goes into the system that gets you customers those customers get results those results Drive reviews in Word of Mouth which then get you more customers the problem is most businesses don't have a good process here or here and and so all they have to do their wheels look like this effort and money customers result more effort in money customers result and they end up dumping a lot of effort out this way and so this creates a linear
(01:12) system where all you do is you have to put more in and you get more out this growth concept is to create a self-reinforcing system where every action or component builds momentum and drives the next creating sustainable growth over time without the continuous input of more effort and more money on the side of the founders Andor investors so tactic number one after you've delivered service for whatever it is so whether you're a plumber and you go to a house or you're a waitress and you just served a customer after you've
(01:41) delivered the value that you deliver with your core product or service you then offer a free gift now that gift is going to be relative to the amount of money that someone spent if someone spends 20 bucks maybe you just give them a bunch of mints if someone spent maybe $100 maybe you give them a $5 dessert if someone spends $1,000 maybe you give them a $50 gift like this lovely money blanket which is definitely not $50 but but the point is that you want to give them a surprise gift number one now once we give that gift we want to pair
(02:12) because we're going to we basically if we've done a good job we will have banked a little bit of reciprocity and so then at that point and this is the key part the person who gives the gift is not the person who necessarily asks for the review so then either the manager of the restaurant the shift manager somebody who is is representing that person then says hey by the way if you leave a a review we give this person $50 so instead of incentivizing the customer we're actually just saying this person who did you good and gave you
(02:42) this gift we're going to pay them if you leave a review and so this allows the customer to say you know what I kind of want to pay back that server I want to pay back that that plumber I want to pay back that person who helped me out and gave me the surprise gift by leaving a review and the further way the person who makes the ask is from the business owner the more compelling I believe it is provided is legal within your area obviously laws apply for advertising I'll tell you a story when L and I were out in a different area traveling for
(03:11) some speaking thing she had to go get her hair done or something and so she quickly was looking on Yelp to try and find a good hair person and when she was there she looked at the reviews unsurprisingly and so there was one that had a five star but had like 20 reviews and another had like a 4.
(03:33) 6 stars but had a th000 reviews which one do you think she went to the 4.6 stars with 1,000 reviews and so the question is that how much was each of those incremental reviews worth if the person who has the most reviews ends up getting 90% of the search volume well a hell of a lot and so should we be willing to pay for reviews not directly but indirectly and the answer is yes this completely works with physical products obviously you could just include inside of the box some sort of you know QR code or link saying hey leave a review and give the
(04:05) gift in exchange or you can give it upfront I wish they would do some research on this um I've tried both and to be honest with you they both work so Step One is surprise gift step two is third party ask the amount that you're willing to pay for the gift and a bonus that that you pay your team should be proportional what a review is worth to you and so if I have a new business and I have almost no reviews each additional review is worth significantly more than once I have 10,000 reviews right but I should still have that review system in
(04:43) place to grease the groove and basically continue the the the growth Loop along its path so if you happen to live under a rock and not believe that reviews are a very valuable thing in business the highest percentage of sales across any Market come from word of mouth it's from people telling other people about stuff and people seeing other people use products and being like hey what is that or who do you use for right when you bought a house you probably didn't respond to an ad you probably did ask your friends for what realtor they used
(05:14) in that area or ask your neighbors right and the higher the stakes of the purchase the more referrals are important the lower the ticket the less it can be dependent but the conversion on the first sale will still be dependent on the proof that you demonstrate and so I like to incorporate proof in all aspects of my business and here's an image of a Lobby where we put proof floor to ceiling of people's festar reviews because the advanced tactic here is that once you do start getting the these reviews coming in what
(05:43) do you think you should do display them everywhere you possibly can and if you have an in-person business you have a double effect compared to everybody else because you can just literally have someone walk into your lobby of all five star reviews and it just anchors what type of business you are which is that you you overd deliver to customers and you do a good job and so if I were a waitress I might say hey by the way uh here's some mints if it's really cheap the type of food that I serve but more realistically I'd probably be willing to
(06:12) pay whatever the cost of a slice of chocolate cake is or whatever the dessert is and say hey it's on me you guys were awesome thank you so much and then when my manager comes through and says by the way Jessica or i' would say by the way our staff gets a $10 bonus if anyone leaves a five stareview if you mention their name um it would mean a lot to us and it would obviously mean a lot to Jessica so you know thanks so much and so if Jessica does it and then asks for the review it would still probably work if they like Jessica but
(06:40) it's so much cleaner to have the manager come afterwards and then say hey if you leave a review Jessica gets 10 bucks my team asked me like well how like that's going to take time for the manager and I was like okay well think about the hypothetical extreme here so let's say that your restaurant turns 10 tables an hour okay then for a manager to go and deliver that line with take maybe 5 minutes to hit all of those 10 tables and that's like if that if you've ever had a manager come over it's usually like 20 seconds it's not a very long
(07:07) time but imagine the effect of that which is that that restaurant every day gets 10 five-star reviews because that means that 10% let's say they turn you know they're open for 10 hours they turn 10 tables an hour it's 100 tables that they turned it's like okay one out of those 10 leaves the review 10 festar reviews a day at the end of the year you've got almost 4,000 reviews like worth it and if the team knows that they're going to be measured on reviews and you can obviously track what percentage of them get five star reviews
(07:34) you have another really high quality metric for customer satisfaction is what percentage of tables that this person served actually did the review what percentage of homes that this particular Home Services guy does leaves a festar review so it just gives you a second metric to look at customer satisfaction in the realest way possible that generates revenue and if you do all of a sudden find one waitress or one guy who's going out in the field and he's getting way more reviews than anyone else just ask what they're doing
(07:59) differently and then teach everybody else and then step three is make it easy and so if I'm the manager I'm going to come by with a QR code on my on a little little A-frame thing one of these little ittybitty guys and I'll leave it on the table right next to the check like I want to make it easy for them to take the next step that also means that over time if I boost the hell out of my Yelp then I'm like okay now I'm going to boost my Google review so I can shift my QR code now I'm going to boost my my Facebook and meta reviews
(08:26) right like each one of these I can shift over time and it might just be you know and then eventually it's just like hey just follow us on Instagram or it could be hey give us your your your your phone number and we'll give you this thing right and then they're on our our text list and if you like that first tactic I talk about it at length inside of my customer referral chapter inside of the leads book and so inside of here I'll I'll give you the referral growth equation so you know exactly how much you can spend on referrals and how to
(08:51) make them viral um and the tactics that actually create the ways to get customers to do this more often and bring in higher quality people and so the seven tactics are inside of this book you can uh you can download they're absolutely free this book is free if you want a digital format uh on audio and uh the Link's in the description so the second tactic to reinforce that review flywheel that then grows the business and gets more customers is merch now hold on what do you mean by that so I realized that my first gym I was there
(09:22) all the time and you know we got a decent amount of Fest star reviews and when I opened my second location it was like starting from scratch again I no reviews no one knew me in the area and I was like man I got to jump start this thing and so I had all these t-shirts that I had bought and I probably had overstocked the amount of t-shirts that I was going to sell in the lobby but I noticed that the shirts didn't sell that much I mean like they hung up and I'd move a couple every week but it wasn't a huge amount of volume and so I was like
(09:47) man these shirts would be so much more valuable to me if two things happened one is if people actually wore them two is if they turned into something more valuable than just wearing them which is well what if I could accomplish both at the same time by just giving them away in exchange for three reviews and so I made this post inside of the group that I had for all my gym members and I said hey I'm opening up my next location if you guys have loved the service go get a workout at the new location and if you
(10:13) do I'll give you a free t-shirt and so the t-shirts cost me five bucks but then what they had to do to get the T-shirt was they had to leave a review on Yelp on Google and on Facebook and checkin and so I had them do four things in exchange for the shirt but guess what happened overnight I had like 155 star reviews for my new location and I had all these people that were rocking my merch so when they're out grocery shopping when they see their friends they're like oh what's that and then I get some Word of Mouth from that and so
(10:39) is a two bird one stone one organic Word of Mouth other digital Word of Mouth that I was able to do by simply saying hey if you want some some merch here or you want one of these jackets that has this nice logo on it just leave a review most people especially if you have a recurring Revenue base will be more than happy to leave a review for you so obvious brick and mortar you can just give merch straight up right so like if you had a gym um or anything that people are in a recurring membership with you could do that now what if you're a uh
(11:10) you know like the plumbing business well the first tactic would probably work better for you so if you're B2B merch might not be as meaningful to your customers as if you're B Toc because if they are frequenting your business on a regular basis they probably have some brand Affinity they're okay wearing it and they would do stuff in exchange to get that kind of merch now the other two tactics I'm going to share with you will help you if you are in one of those B2B uh situations and so here's how the tactic works there's my world's best T-shirt
(11:40) there we go you pay five bucks for the t-shirt and then that t-shirt then gets you a Yelp review it gets you a Google review it gets you a meta review which is wherever you're running your ads from so this stuff is so important cuz what we're thinking about here is how do people actually find your business well they're going to search on yel depending on the industry you're in you're going to be running Google PPC ads or they're going to be searching on Google and they're going to find it through SEO you're running ads on meta and so we're
(12:11) covering each of the the platforms the surface area that someone is coming in so even though we're asking for three for every new customer they're only going to see maybe one of these things and then finally we get the actual Word of Mouth from actually wearing the thing in public and this is just organic and so in each of these situations we're actually covering a new type of advertising only with one $5 give if you're less comfortable with giving out the like if you're like my Brand's not that strong right now then you can have
(12:37) just an inspirational quote or saying on the shirt so when I did my shirts I think I had like a beast mode engaged shirt my customers were wearing that rather than uh my logo but my logo was on the back or the side you know so you can put it on the sleeve or you can put it on the back if you want to have like some cool factor that goes with it so what's the third tactic boom you give them a big pile of money no not exactly but instead we actually just offer a discount and so the amount that you can offer the discounts can be proportional
(13:04) whatever your gross profit is and the average ticket and so I was talking to a restaurant owner not that long ago he needed to get new reviews for a new location and so the strategy we came up with was really simple I said would you give somebody a dollar off their meal and he was a very budget Diner in terms of the the the type of establishment he was he was running very high volume and I said would you give a dollar off so it's about 5% of the average ticket of somebody who's walking in the door and he said yeah I would pay a dollar I was
(13:26) like right because that means you'd pay $5,000 for 5,000 review VI like that's a good deal and so what we decided to do is that when people came with the check they would put the hey for f if you want to save a dollar on each person each person can leave a review and we put the little QR code on top and then the waitress when she delivered the check also basically Drew attention to it and said hey if you do that I'll go bring your check back with the discount included and so if you think about this as as a meta concept the first two
(13:55) examples I gave you were things where you add something good you add some sort of incentive the first one is you add something but not in exchange for anything based on reciprocity and then the Goodwill goes to the person who did the service the second one is where you give a direct exchange with the customer like do this for me and I'll give I'll do this for you very quck Pro Crow very straightforward this one with the discount is about removing bad stuff right and so bad stuff being the price of whatever they had to pay right and so
(14:21) the most effective way to do this in my opinion is as the check or as the invoice is being delivered and this is where people mess this up is that they will say hey if you leave forw will give you 20% off your next one you will be able to give significantly less off if you just say it's available right now and so latency is one of the strongest multipliers of a persuasive tool risk and delay actually work very similarly in people's minds so the further out it is the less powerful the thing that you give you say hey I'll give you $100 in a
(14:52) year if you leave a review most people would rather have $2 off today so number one is at point of sale so it's when you present the price so once you present the price and you get acceptance on the price then you offer the discount discount presented you then get them to say yes they want to do it if they do it so this is now you verify that they actually did the review so you have them show you that they did the review then you recalculate the overall price and then you hand them the final check and then both parties are better off so number
(15:29) four keys well the fourth tactic is a bonus tactic for you but it's any kind of unlockable now this works particularly well with any kind of uh B2B service business anything that's National or digital uh rather than in person so the first three that I gave are very IRL driven so discounts you can use whenever um but like giving a real inperson gift or giving merch sometimes can be a little bit uh harder online versus in person so if you have online what you can do is you can unlock either either media which is hey we're going to give
(16:03) you some sort of uh training that's associated with this or VIP trial so what does that mean and this is why this is uh extra extra nasty in a good way which is if you have multiple levels of service your cost to deliver that service is typically not overwhelmingly high right when people do these add-ons so like if you're an SEO Agency for example maybe you'll you'll rank another domain or you'll start you you you'll spin up extra backlinks or whatever whatever your core Services you say hey by the way if you do this I will
(16:34) unlock a trial of a higher level of service for 20 you know a 30-day period something like that the benefit of this is that not only do you get the review you also give the customer a trial a taste of the higher-end version of the service that you deliver and so this becomes extra powerful because it starts with Goodwill and you may just end up converting these customers into more valuable customers over time so you get you literally get paid to get reviews now if you have a media thing that you want to unlock called it a training
(17:04) called it an event called it something like that you can do that as well in the IRL version of this you can have call it an annual event that people are invited to and their ticket to get in is that they left to review and you can do this both virtually or in real life and so anything that you can give away that is remote would obviously work and I also like having Trials of services or pieces of a higher level to encourage people to one taste it and then maybe just maybe give us money for it later and so here's
(17:32) the deal if you don't do this what's going to happen is that you're going to have a linear business you have to keep flowing effort and money in and then money comes out and you have to keep doing this over and over again when you stop doing this you stop getting this but when you set up a system like this where you have a loop where customers get results results turn into reviews and then those reviews get you more customers the business over time becomes self- sustaining and so every business has to have this in place place if they
(17:59) hope to separate themselves from the investors or Founders who breathed life in it to begin with you want the engine to run without you you are lighter fluid not the log because if you're the log you'll eventually get burned out as you get tons and tons of reviews in your business you get more Customs from it every once in a while you're going to get a negative review and this video shows you how to handle them

Transcript:
(00:00) You can beat 99% of other businesses if you only pick one thing to beat them on. But there's four that you can compete on. All right? And so that's what we're going to talk about. The first of the four vectors is speed. How do I do what I'm going to do faster than everybody else? Of the four vectors, I'm starting with speed because I actually think it's the most important of the four.
(00:22) And I think the reason for that is that humans learn behaviors with decreased latency. meaning like Facebook and and and Instagram or whatever you're watching this on like has trained us to come back not because they pay us to come back because they have compressed latency for some positive outcome and the positive outcome they give us is a thumbs up.
(00:42) They literally give us a little red light and other people give actual money but at a delay and they struggle to get people to do things. So think about it like this. You pay someone who works for you every two weeks. It's much harder to motivate them than if you actually paid them in real time.
(00:58) And paying someone in real time is actually so effective, it's illegal. Truckers, for example, used to be able to get paid per mile and like almost essentially in real time. And so they actually outlawed it because guys would just keep driving to the point of like insanity and wouldn't sleep for days and it was unsafe.
(01:17) That's how powerful speed is because that is what trains behavior. functionally the questions that we have to ask ourselves is okay if speed is going to be my competitive advantage it doesn't matter what we do right there's components to speed right so on one angle like you have to think about each of these larger vectors in smaller sub vectors for speed it could be the distance between when someone purchases and when they get something right that's one vector of speed the other vector is that if you're doing something on a recurring basis how
(01:42) much time is it going to take each time so for example if I had a 10-minute workout it's going to be more valuable than an hourong workout if I could get the same results If I say I'm going to help someone get leads and I can help them get those leads in an hour versus waiting a week to turn on the ads, that's more valuable, right? And so at all times, it's always like, how can we take what we're currently doing and do it faster? And I can promise you, if you just did that one thing compared to everyone else in in your marketplace,
(02:06) you just delivered faster, you'll have a sustainable competitive advantage over them and be able to charge premium prices for it. What's really interesting about speed is that speed rarely actually costs more. It typically comes from idea alpha, meaning like idea over performance, like you've thought through the process of their steps better than the competition has.
(02:28) And as a result, you actually can get better outcomes. Now, part of this also comes down to what types of customers you're picking. If you have a hundred different types of customers, it's very difficult to do things quickly because you're doing lots of different things for lots of different people. This is why niching down also helps you provide more value because you're being more selective about the customers you're picking.
(02:43) And then as a result, you can be more templatized in the in the types of services and and and products that you ultimately offer. And so there's kind of three different vectors that I think about uh in terms of like what can I actually do to improve speed? Because you're like, okay, I get that, but how do I actually do it? So number one is I want templates.
(03:01) All right, how can I take what we're currently doing and make these into templates? Can I have ad templates? Can I have email templates? Can I have landing page templates? Can I have presentation templates? Can I have at least templated steps that someone's going to follow? Right? All of these are just templates that we can pass on to somebody else.
(03:14) Create a repeatable process. If it's repeatable, they don't have to decide. Decision-m is typically the slowest part in the organization. So, how do we remove all decisions to speed up the time of completion? The second one is pre-made. So, if you're in physical products or even food, it's I mean, fundamentally McDonald's changed the game in fast food because they started pre-making food.
(03:31) They already had burgers on the line. So, when someone ordered a burger, they just handed it to them. And if you haven't seen the movie Founder, great movie. He experiences this and he's like, "No, no, no. I I just ordered." And they're like, "Yeah, that's your burger." And he's like, "No, but I I just ordered." And they're like, "Yeah, that's your burger.
(03:47) " And he's like, "Huh?" And it's this big aha moment like, "Oh, this changes everything." And so sometimes if you know, there was a great Persian place I used to go to. It crushes in California. It's called Panini Cafe. Go check it out. But they make amazing Persian food. But one of the things I realized is right as the lunch hour started because I lived pretty close by back then.
(04:02) They just started grilling chicken because they knew that they were about to get the lunch rush and they knew that they were going to have people who wanted juj kebab. Shout out for those of you who know. All right. And so they just thought ahead of time and it became really vi because I would show up and be like juj kebab extra rice my whole thing.
(04:18) And they would just boom they would deliver for me because they didn't even have to make two order because they just knew certain amounts of things are always going to have demand. And even if for some reason someday they're not going to hit that, the benefit they get of the vast majority of their customers immediately getting served and how many tables they returned faster more than paid for the small extra chicken that maybe they didn't they had to throw out at the end of the day.
(04:38) The third element here, and this happens a lot with services, is availability. Now, what does this mean? I'll give you a couple examples. If you have a spa or a salon or something, if you have more availability for people to book, it means they want something and they can immediately get it faster. They can get the appointment with you to get their nails done, get their hair done.
(04:52) Basically, the sooner you can have that availability, the more you will be able to convert and the more people will be willing to pay. And so, if someone says, "Hey, I have an appointment in 4 days or I have an appointment in one day," they're probably far more likely to come to you and be willing to pay more for that one appointment.
(05:06) But how do you increase availability? Sometimes it means you have to pay people more or extend their hours or hire more people. But the reality is that this is one of those things that is one of the largest vectors in terms of increasing throughput on a business that is underappreciated by the vast majority of business owners.
(05:22) And so when I invest in a company or I look at a company a lot of times I'm like oo like it's one of the those huge hidden diamonds. I probably shouldn't even share this but it's one of those hidden diamonds that I can almost always drive 20 30 40% more through business by simply better staffing the hours. Even at acquisition.
(05:38) com we currently sell 12 hours a day, 7 days a week. And we're now investing so we can get to 20 hours a day because we have such a large international market. We always want to increase our availability because I know the math behind this and it's a huge impact on the bottom line. All right, so the first vector, macro vector that you can win on, and you only need one, but if you have more than one, you just dominate everyone.
(05:58) All right, is that we went over speed. Now, the second is risk. All right, so how can we make our thing not risky? Now, think about McDonald's, the example I gave you. Well, they're both fast and they're not risky. So, what does that actually mean? Now, part of you are like, "Oh, no. They're risky because of cancer and all this other stuff.
(06:18) " Well, well, let's ignore that because why? Why do people not care about this stuff? Actually, it's funny. Speed. It's not latency. If you ate a burger and immediately had something growing on on on you, no one would eat the burgers, but because it happens 40 years from now, no one cares. Speed changes behavior. And lack of speed doesn't.
(06:35) So, what about risk? So, a way you can translate risk is reliability and consistency. It's a different way of saying it, which is when people buy, this is especially important for services that are recurring, where people get month after month after month after month, they keep coming back again and again and again. And so the question is, how can we consistently match conditions between the perfect and ideal state and every state that happens afterwards? And most people dramatically underestimate the amount of variables that exist in any
(06:58) given encounter. And so as a result, they have far less consistency than they otherwise should. So that's just the output. Now, what are the other components of this? So I'll say one is consistency. All right? In terms of decreasing risk. Uh we could also consider that reliability. If you say you're gonna cut someone's grass, but sometimes you're late or you uh show up a different day or you don't show up one week, like that's a major hit.
(07:21) People just don't want to deal with that stuff. Like they're not willing to. On the flip side, if you're the type of guy where someone's like, "You know what? I could I could undercut your lawn care guy. You know what? I could I could clean instead of your cleaning person." A lot of people are like, "You know what? I've been with Rose for for 10 years and she's never missed a day.
(07:36) " You're like, "I just I'm not willing to take the risk because she's already paid down so much." It's like, "But I could do for 20% less." It's like it's just not worth it, right? That's real value that actually defends the business. Now, what other types of risk mitigation can we offer? All right, one of them is reputation, right? So, this is where brand comes in.
(07:56) So, the consistency, reliability typically happens after someone makes a purchase. But how do we how do we shift the perception to the customer that they're going to have a a high likelihood outcome that they're going to get what they want? Well, one of the easiest ways is that you've gotten somebody else exactly what they wanted and that person found out about it.
(08:11) Now, if they don't know someone directly, but then they just heard lots of whispers, that's a reputation. You've done it enough times for enough people that you just have a reputation for keeping your word, right? And a lot of people, especially in the in the small business space, especially especially in their like response base, all of a sudden sometimes their their their cost to acquire customer goes up rapidly and they're like, "What's going on? What's happening?" But the thing is is that the CPMs in your industry haven't gone up by double or triple in that same period of
(08:35) time. So, what is it? Is that your word of mouth? People believe in positive word of mouth. You think negative word of mouth doesn't exist. Negative word of mouth is like 10 times as viral as positive. And somehow you think that doesn't affect your sales. Of course it affects your sales. People who would have otherwise purchased choose not to because of something they heard or read online. And so one is okay.
(08:53) So we've got reputation, we've got and we've got consistency. So how do we do this? How do we actually operationalize this? Now I've talked a lot about guarantees. I talked about in the offers book. All right. Um and a lot of people took that immediately like oh guarantees are the only way that we reverse risk.
(09:06) It's just one of the components. And I give that to people because I assume that a lot of people don't have a good reputation or don't have a reputation at all or they don't have enough customers to really develop a process to become consistent. But these two things are how you deliver long-term risk mitigation.
(09:21) In the short term, you do guarantees. Now again, and I what's really interesting about this is that everyone assumes that I was like the guarantee guy, but like a lot of my stuff that I sell has no guarantees, right? But the thing is is that there's four different types that I cover in the book. All right? The first is unconditional guarantees.
(09:37) When you're starting out, that's a great way to do it. Conditional guarantees. If you do this and it doesn't happen, then I'll do then I'll do why? What's my what's my consideration, right? What am I going to put on the table if you're going to put this money on the table? And a lot of times people mess this up.
(09:50) Guarantees only work if you have stakes. So, if you don't have reputation, you've got to basically, it's literally like giving a a payday loan. It's like you got to put you got to take your watch off and be like, "If you give me the money, I'll put the watch down, right? You can take my car if I don't pay this loan back.
(10:04) " It's the same idea just in business. You're starting out. You're like, "Here's my shirt. If I don't deliver these leads or I don't deliver a great back, you know, massage or I don't deliver a good fitness experience, you can take my shirt." Those are the first two. There's two other types of guarantees.
(10:17) There's implied and then there's anti. All right? So, implied guarantees is one of my favorite types to use, which is just performance-based. If you're good at what you do, winners always want to compete on performance. Think about your best salespeople. They always want the most upside because they're good.
(10:31) And so if you're actually good, be willing to put it's another way of putting skin in the game for you, right? And so just put skin in the game. And people are far more willing to take risk if you take some risk for them. So it's like we've got this big pile of risk. How much are we going to eat down versus the customer eating down? Now here's the cool part is that you can shrink that pile of risk over time with reputation.
(10:52) Which brings up the fourth guarantee, which is an anti-g guarantee, which once you do have reputation and you are consistent, you don't see McDonald's saying, "We guarantee that the burger is going to be good." You just know it's going to be good, right? Because you've had enough people. Now, people are like, "Oh my god, McDonald's is not good." Calm down.
(11:06) You get the point from a business perspective. All right? So, that's vector one is speed is how can we do whatever we're doing faster. Number two is risk. How can we do it more consistently? How can we do it more reliably? How can we and in so doing build our reputation over time? and that consistency and reliability. How do I do that tactically? It's actually looking at as many variables that affect the condition or can affect the outcome for the customer as humanly possible and then actually trying to control for all of them. So BF Skinner,
(11:33) famous behavioral psychologist said if many variables exist, many variables must be studied. And so you might find out so like for us to make videos, we have like a hundred different little golden BB's, little things that when put together make a good video. And if we just do 98, it's just a little bit less good of a video.
(11:51) If we do 97, it's a little bit less good of a video. And so we just tried every time we learn a little bit more, we add to that list. Make another condition that we didn't realize existed that mattered. We were just talking about one right before I did this video. So we did this big filming session where I did a walk-in talk and it was hot outside.
(12:05) So I took my shirt off and I was doing it. It was in Florida. It was super humid. And that whole series of kind of like walking talk things that I did murdered. It was like some of my it was probably the single best recording session I've ever had in terms of performance of the clips in the session.
(12:20) So, we're like, "Oh, walk and talks work great." So, then I did another series of walk-in talks where I'm just like in normal clothes because it wasn't it was actually cold out. I think I put a jacket on and so I put a jacket on in the second one and literally I think it might have been the actual worst recording session that I ever had.
(12:35) What we got to see there is that it wasn't the walk-in talk that was the thing that made the shorts valuable. It might have been me being shirtless, which I have other considerations for, which is like maybe maybe I'll start only Alex someday. Uh but for now those are the first two speed and risk or risque if you will.
(12:52) Now the third one is price. It's cheap right? So you can be faster, you can be uh less risky or you can be cheaper. Now we have a fourth one too but let's talk about this for a second. I tend to be the sell for more more expensive guy. But you can win with any of these three vectors. If people absolutely know that your stuff's amazing, they'll be willing to pay more for it and they'll come to you instead of somebody else.
(13:16) If you're the fastest, they absolutely will come to you over other people because you can deliver on all these vectors of speed. If you're the cheapest, people will absolutely come to you. Like to pretend that price doesn't matter is silly. Of course price matters but so does value because value is a sorry the the deal rather is the comparison between price what you pay and what you get right and so something is appropriately cheap if you get tremendous value for a low price but the answer is not hearing this and saying oh I will now lower my price that
(13:49) is certainly a terrible decision but instead it's day one deciding our competitive advantage the moat that we're going to build around is being cheaper than everyone else. And you have to start that way day one. That means every component of the business from click to close to delivered is organized such that you can pass on as much of that cost-saving to the customer.
(14:12) And so, for example, um if you were like, hey, I want to start a you know, a marketing agency for small business owners. Well, in general, typically a pretty bad business. Why? Because it turns out really high. Their volatility reflects onto you with an exception. If you can make the services cheap enough, I have seen it work well, but I mean way cheaper than you think.
(14:33) I'm talking $100 to $300 a month for services that most people charge $2,000 a month for. When you can do that, now you have something that a lot of people are interested in. So that even on their worst day of business, they're like, "Well, I'm not going to cancel that." Like, it's it's only a hundred bucks, only 200 bucks, and it certainly makes way more than that even on my worst month.
(14:52) Right? And to the same degree we there basically okay if I want to do this right if you're you like okay how do I actually build for cheapness all right so there's three ways that I think about this so number one is you can have AI right day one now a lot of you guys should be already be investing this stuff like for sure AI is giving the best employees 10x the leverage they had before and so if there's ever been a time to have to pay people better it's been today because AI is now taking your best person making it 10 times as effective so it's like why
(15:18) would you not like you're always like man if I could have 10 10 John's or 10 Daniels or 10 10 Michaels, man, that would be amazing. It's like, well, AI is giving you 10 Michaels and so be willing to pay the Michaels of your business more because you actually do get more from them now more than ever.
(15:33) So, number one is AI. The second is I'll just say automation because I think automation for some reason has like been forgotten about. Um, there's still lots of stuff that can get automated that doesn't necessarily have AI, but you build day one with those automations in place. Now, the third is offshoring, right? or near shoring basically paying significantly less for the same labor, but you're actually making this your entire business strategy from day one.
(15:57) We are going to win by being the cheapest. And if that's you, then you state that first and foremost in your marketing, in your sales. And what's really cool about it is typically when you're the cheapest, the sales are pretty easy. Uh marketing is not that hard. The difficulty is being profitable.
(16:12) But I've seen some tremendously profitable businesses that structure themselves from day one on being the cheapest. And a little little tidbit, a little pro tip that I think a lot of business owners are going to miss out on. I think people are not are not getting this. If you do all this stuff, let's say you do the offshoring, you do the automation to the eye.
(16:29) You don't need to tell your customers. You can just have AI automation and offshoring into your business and you just sell a normal service. You don't need to tell them you have a bunch of VAS in the Philippines. You don't need to tell them that a lot of your stuff is from AI. Don't say, "Hey, we're an AI design firm.
(16:44) " Just be a design firm and then charge the same rates or a good deal for design because you just have an automated backend. Great. Amazing. So, that will allow you to get more cash flow in the business and ultimately provide more value. All right. So, three vectors so far. Speed, how do I do it faster than anybody else in the market? Risk, how do I do it more reliably and build a reputation better than anyone else in the market? Cost, how do I do it cheaper, consistently, and still be profitable than anyone else in the market? And finally, you have ease. Now,
(17:08) before I dive into these, I want to make this point. If you just win on one of these, you can have an incredibly successful business. If you can do multiple vectors, then you'll crush everyone. Real quick, check this out. So, if you aren't sure what strategic competitive advantage you should be doubling down on, um, I'd love to invite you out to one of our scaling workshops uh, that we have here in Vegas at our headquarters and my team can actually work with you on it.
(17:30) But before you do that, you can download our free $100 million scaling roadmap um where you can plug in information and it will give you basically your step where you're at in the scaling process and ultimately give you the things you can help get to the next level. But like I said, if you want help from my team, you can book a call after you download this.
(17:45) It's free and we'd love to uh see if we can help you out. A quote that I like is the best for the most people for the least. And so best probably takes into account speed and ease um and risk. And for the most it's going to be like total number of people that it helps. And then for the least, right? It's like and I've had different one like unique expensive sticky air.
(18:05) How do I do something that no one else can do? How do I have it that they keep buying it? How do I have it that I have high gross margins? And how do I have it so it's over and over and over again? Right? So we think about these little monikers. I think about this when I'm trying to build a business because ultimately these are the ways that you win.
(18:18) These are the strategic modes. So people talk about strategy, but fundamentally it's going to have to ladder up to one of these things. So if you're like, "Oh, by the way, what's acquisition.coms, it's going to be this one probably primarily and then I would say secondary vectors are these. We're obviously not cheapest, right? And so that's where I've built my business around.
(18:36) Now, if I had a different now, not all the business, our portfolio are are built that way, right? We have a a teeth whiting chain that's more around speed, ease, and cheapness, right? And so you get like you have to make sure that the strategy is is best tailored to the customer after you're trying to serve. All right, let's talk about ease.
(18:52) I want to make a big point about ease. If you want to make your product more convenient for customers, you don't make something convenient because we want to like I want to do something to my product. It's actually the opposite, which is why I think most products suck. You make something easier by removing everything that is no longer required.
(19:09) You make something easy by saying what is what is hard about this and then removing everything that's hard. And so what's cool about this process is all like like easy is not the outcome. It's removing all hard and then easy happens as a consequence. Right? So like easy is not noticeable. It's like good design.
(19:27) It should vanish. Right? Like if you look at an iPhone, an iPhone is the result of what happens when you remove everything that sucks about a phone and what remains is an iPhone. The the UX vanishes into the screen. There's no menus. You just hit what you need. It immediately opens up. Right? This is how we have to think about ease.
(19:45) And so this happens for services. It happens for products. And just like I was saying earlier with if many variables exist, many variables must be studied. And the nice thing is that customers will tell you what's what's hard thing number one, what's hard thing number two, what's hard number three, what's hard thing number four. And you have that list.
(20:01) And then the way that you make something easy is one at a time crossing things out one at a time until eventually people are like, "Man, this thing just works." And that takes work. Take a thing, figure out what makes it hard, remove all those pieces, and then what you're left with is something that's easy. This is the work.
(20:19) And I wish I could say this in a hundred different ways, but like honestly, that's the game. And so when we're thinking about this, it's like as a c like you want to think again, click to close to delivered. So when a customer is coming into your ecosystem into your world, how much information do they need to give? Do they have to give information the same information on multiple calls? Are we passing calls between reps? Like I'll give you a really simple example.
(20:40) So right now you probably have like if you have a business that that sells via appointments, right? You have phone calls, you have people manning the calls. If you have multiple calls that occur in order for someone to buy, let me tell you what happens all the time. Call one, tell me about your business. All right, tell me about the size of the business.
(20:54) Tell me about some qualification. Blah blah blah. Okay, cool. So then let me set you up with Charlie. Charlie will get you set up. Okay, cool. Now we get on the phone with Charlie. Three days later. Charlie's like, "Hey, how's it going? What's the revenue of the business? What's the size of the business? What's the You're like, "Dude, I just I just told the Why am I Why am I telling I hate you already?" Right? And so instead of doing that, let me show you the thing is that this is a very binary outcome.
(21:14) This is a very binary one. A lot of them aren't. A lot of them are more continuous, but this is binary. And the only thing easier than doing what I'm about to share with you is not doing it, which is why most people don't. your salespeople, your setters, or your sales people in general should take notes on the customers.
(21:28) And here's what's cool. If you start the second call and say, "Hey, had a conversation with Charlie. Charlie told me that your revenue is this, your industry is this, and the biggest issue you're dealing with is this. Does that sound about right?" They're going to be like, "Wow, they actually did some homework.
(21:44) This is a pretty buttoned up operation. You know what? That just made it easier." And so, we have to think about every single little step. That's just that's just the sale. And if you don't think that how you sell affects their perception of the quality of service that you have, you are kidding yourself. Many people will make a judgment based on how good your product is, based on how good your sales motion is, how clean it is, how dial it is.
(22:06) If you call someone in 30 seconds, they're like, "Man, these guys are on it." They would imagine that if you make a promise about speed later, guess what? The past experience they have that they're going to use as judgment is on the sales process. And so this again I'm just talking about sales because everyone like you know everybody likes talking about sales but um well I like talking about sales fine caught me.
(22:26) Uh on the flip side is the back end is the same thing. What's the onboarding call look like? What are the activation points? What are the touch points with the customer? What kind of reporting are we going to provide to them so they know that we're we're delivering them value? What things do we give? We're giving massage.
(22:38) We giving a map where we show them where the pain is and we show them hey when they come back in this is where you said last time you were in pain. How's that on a scale from 1 to 10 today? Wow that was really good. Like I mean, can you imagine you walk into a massage place you've been to before and they're like, "Oh, last time you struggled with your shoulder.
(22:51) " And the reason that so many people like just going with the same person is because the business have so few processes. And so it's like, well, I might as well just go with the same masseuse because she knows me. But if every masseuse or massager, I don't know, the male version, whatever, massager, uh, already knew the pain that you were dealing with beforehand.
(23:09) Could you imagine what a superior experience that would be as a company? And then also, how much more would you be able to keep customers? Whereas when the masseuse leaves, they take all the customers that went with them. Not very sticky. But if every massage person knew all the pain points of the business, that would make it easier.
(23:24) Easy is when everything that's hard vanishes. And that's all that's left is the value. If you're looking at these four, how can I do it faster? How can I make it more reliable? How can I do it cheaper? How can I make it easier for the customer? The end state, the the kill shot is that you have all four. Now, to have all four, it almost always has to be tech.
(23:42) Now, you can typically have three of the four if you have labor. All right? So, if you have a service based business, you're basically going to need to pick three. But specifically, you need to make sure you have one. Now, why why am I so hard on this one thing? Well, customers do not understand multiple benefits. Now, they can like from a messaging perspective.
(23:58) Now, when they buy something and they experience it, that's different. But from a marketing angle, if you say, "Hey, we're the fastest, we're the least risky, and we're the easiest," it's too much. Just focus on the core vector. And if you're like, which one do I pick? Pick the one that values the most to your customer.
(24:15) Pick to the one that they care about the most. And so if you know that your people care the most about speed, then speed's the speed's the angle. If there's a huge cost when something doesn't go well with a business, then risk is the angle, right? Or the customer, whatever, right? And if and if it's just in general a huge pain to do this thing, then how can I make it easy? So I'll tell you, there's a there's a lady that I know in Albuquerque, New Mexico that I used to um that I used to go to church with when I went to church. and she had a massive
(24:41) business in in in New Mexico. And her entire business was built on one thing, speed and ease. She had a DMV business where she just privatized getting people their IDs. That was it. That's all it was. And I remember her talking to me and she was like, "Yeah, they just passed a new law that everybody uh in New Mexico has to get a new ID because we just changed the license.
(25:05) " And she was like, "Well, that's uh, you know, 12 million people times 50 bucks." And I just remember her saying that. I was like, "How elegant, right?" And the thing is is that her $50 is like she was able to get people in and out in 15 minutes from the time they walked in the door to the time they left. Could you imagine how lovely of an experience that would be? Everybody when they think about getting their idea right now, it's like just pain.
(25:27) All you think is just like waste of a day, just frustration, dealing with inept people who have no urgency, no regard for other people, and just generally deal with you as a nuisance. Like you're somehow inconveniencing them in their day of not working that you have disrupted their day of not working by existing and breathing on them, right? Of course you hate them.
(25:46) And so she just had a business not hard to beat, right? When that's the standard. Again, there are industries that are like this that are privatized that still no one tries to compete in. And so if you want to get into a new space or you already have a business and you're like, "How do I actually win? I feel like I'm the same as everybody else.
(26:03) " Pick one and dominate. And so if you're wondering which of these do I pick? Obviously, you start with the customer reverse backwards. But let's do the DMV example I just said. Is she going to win on being cheaper than the government? No. I'm pretty sure it's free or it's a nominal price in order to get the new the new IDs.
(26:18) And so she's not going to win on cheap. But what could what else could she win on? Speed, ease. In other ways, the ease can also be like positive customer experience. Like those are things that improve the overall experience for the customer. She could could she double her prices? I'll bet you plenty of people probably be willing to pay $100 to not have to waste a day, right? So she doesn't have to win on this, right? So she has to pick the one that that now risk.
(26:39) I mean, as long as you get the idea, I mean, you have to be good enough at this, right? But she's going to work on her reputation by being having a reputation of being faster and easier, right? And so if you're trying to pick one, you pick the one that's going to matter most to the customer. And if you are competing in a space that has a lot of cheap or sometimes even free competitors, just remember this fast beats free.
(27:01) So back in the day, there was Napster, which some of you guys may have remembered. It's probably before actually probably half of y'all's time. Uh there's something called Lime Wire that happened later. Uh there was Kazah, there was all these different uh basically sharewware things where you could share files with one another and ultimately just like steal music for free. I'll just be honest.
(27:16) That's what it was. Right. So when that was happening, how did a company like Spotify come in not really free um and beat them? They won on speed and they went on risk because when you downloaded Lime Wire, you knew that you were downloading all sorts of viruses to your computer, number one. And then number two on Spotify, it was like it was just you just picked the song, you could immediately start listening to it.
(27:39) And so they beat an industry that was literally free by being faster. And I remember when I uh when I went to get Chipotle once, this was at University of Maryland. I was visiting the campus. And it has I think it's like the number one highest grossing Chipotle in like the nation. This thing is packed. It's in the middle of like the the Commons or whatever, right? And it was happened to be Halloween, the weekend that I went to visit. You can imagine.
(28:00) And so at Halloween for Chipotle, they do this thing where if you wear any kind of foil, you dress up like a burrito, they like give you free burritos, whatever. And I didn't know, I didn't think that that was the day that I wanted to go have Chipotle. So I walk up and I'm like, "Oh." And it was it was imagine a grocery store parking lot.
(28:14) So massive parking lot. There's a twot there. The line stretched through the entire parking lot. It was insane. And I just remember thinking to myself when I got there and I was like, I would pay $20 to just have the burrito that I want and not have to wait in this line even if it's free.
(28:31) And that was the moment where I cinched that that that that concept. Fast beats free. So if you're not sure, start with the customer, reverse backwards, look at the competitive landscape. You probably one of these one of these four vectors or maybe more. If you guys are like, "Man, this is so good." Let me tell you a cool little secret.
(28:50) If this just feels true, you're like, "This is so true." Guess why it's so true? Because these four are the value equation. So your risk is your perceived like achievement. Your ease is your effort and sacrifice. Your speed is your time delay. And then your your your cheaper is going to be ultimately the dream outcome.
(29:09) Those are the elements of value. And so all that is I put different words around something that is these are the core elements of value. And because they're the core elements of value, those are the things you have to translate to your customer in your marketing as your one defining winning angle. And if you haven't picked the book, you can go grab it.
(29:25) Um it's free on my podcast and it's on Amazon and you can probably find it wherever you search it. Hey, if you like this video, you might like this video uh because it's similar to this one, except even more awesome.

Transcript:
(00:00) I'm going to walk you through a four-step process that I think puts business on easy mode. And so whether you're just getting started or you're already making tons of money and are just trying to make more, this process just works. And I've done it in tons of different portfolio companies and companies we've advised.
(00:17) Um, and just to give you a little bit of context, um, as of last year, our portfolio at acquisition.com did over $250 million in aggregate revenue. And I say that not as a promise that if you do this, you're going to get that outcome, but that this works. All right, so that being said, let's dive in. Step number one, get the ad.
(00:35) So, we have to fundamentally show something to someone in order for them to find out about our stuff, right? Can we agree on that? If the answer to that is yes, then the first step here is that we're going to have some sort of advertisement. Now, that ad might be somebody reaching out. It's an advertisement, literally letting people know about stuff.
(00:55) It could be a paid ad, so it could be an interruptionbased ad that happens, you know, on any social media platform. It could be a piece of content like this that says, "Hey, you know, go buy this thing." Now, between all the different ways of getting customers, paid ads versus content versus outreach versus maybe the exception being affiliates, paid ads is the most, you know, the the fastest to scale because one guy with buttons and good creative could scale it to the mood, right? And so, it's all about skill when it comes to creating paid ads. Now, I'm going to just use this as
(01:23) our placeholder, but if you're trying to get into paid ads, uh, then I'll give you two little frameworks that have worked really well for me. All right, so number one, and this is a new one, which is absolutely murdering it for us, is what I'll call organic plus CTA. Very complicated. All right, so what is organic plus CTA? It's you have whatever organic content you make.
(01:45) Some content does better than others, provided you make organic content relevant to the stuff you sell, which by the way, probably a good idea. Um, you make your content and then you find the good ones.
(01:59) And then all you do is you add a call to action at the end that sends people to your thing and we already know it works because we've already tried it. And so you get to have all these test shots on goal that cost you nothing by simply making the content. And then you just let the algorithm tell you what people already like and they engage with and they share and they click, they get past the hook and then you just say, "Oh, I'm going to take this thing and I'm going to turn into something that feeds my business in a more scalable way because I'm not going to rely on the platform to just give it to people for free, which is great. But I also can't really add a
(02:24) longer call to action because it would tank the effectiveness of the clip. But if I put it in the beginning and then I pay the platform, then they're happy to display it because they were already happy to display it for free. So why wouldn't they want to display it in exchange for money? And then we can add our very simple call to action at the end for some sort of thing which I'll get to in a second. Now the second kind of way of thinking about this like this one's by far the easiest. If you can do
(02:46) this do it. Now if you're like okay I don't have enough organic or you know I just need to you know quickly make ads directly then this is the framework that I would use. So I have hook plus meat plus CTA. All right. So I'm going to break down each of these really quickly.
(03:02) So from a hook's perspective, what I do is I still look at the best performing organic and the best performing ads across all industries. So this is one where you don't need to stick to your industry. You might find a hook that works exceptionally well in finance and it works really well for hotels too, right? Provided it doesn't like actually say finance in it.
(03:17) And so you'll see that hooks just convert across way different audiences because it just draws attention. And so the first thing I'll look at is hooks. And this is by far the 80% of the ad. And you're like, "Wait, but they're so short and they're still the most important. So, we should just be thankful. It's crazy.
(03:35) It's like people have a hard time accepting that something short could be more meaningful than something long because it takes more work. Like, would you prefer that the thing that means the most is actually really hard and long to do? No. Right? Like the fact that hooks are short is a gift from God for advertisers that we can actually have the most important thing not require a ton of work.
(03:54) Now, if you want to be smart about it, it should require work because you're going to do that work in the research or the pre-search before you record this. So, for here, I would have at least 50 plus hooks. Now, you're like, 50 plus hooks? Yeah, you're probably not making nearly enough ads. And I don't care what your spend is. Like, if you're spending $10,000 a month, $100,000 a month, like, you can never have too many ads. I'll just say that. You can never have too many ads.
(04:12) You just give the algorithm more things to pick from to find the winners. Now, the meat, I'm going to give you a different framework that I haven't talked about much lately. And so, I'm going to break it down for you right here. All right. This is fourstep persuasion. And I just think it's just so easy to understand.
(04:30) So this is how I think this is my mental framework, all right, for how I actually make persuasive advertisements, copy, pitches, whatever, right? Which is you're going to get more good stuff if you do the thing I want you to do. You're going to get less bad stuff if you do the thing I want you to do. And if you don't do the thing that I want you to do, you're going to get more bad stuff. And you're going to get less good stuff. That's it.
(04:50) Four different angles that you can hit on any action I want you to take. So, if you sign up for the gym, you're going to feel better. I'm making this obviously really simple. You're gonna get more good feels. You're have more energy. You're going to have you're going to sleep better. All that stuff's good. Now, what's the inverse of that? You're not going to feel the brain fog that you've been feeling. You're not going to feel as lethargic.
(05:09) Um you're not going to have your kids out playing and feel like you can't play with them and feel like a bad parent. We're going to get rid of all that minus negative thing. The only thing easier, you know, than taking this small action today is not taking that action. But the thing is is that if you don't take that action, then whatever brain fog you're feeling right now, the current weight that you put on the last 5 years, let's push it out two or three years, how much more weight are you going to be? Like if you're if you're 50 pounds overweight now, what are you going to feel like at
(05:32) 70 lbs overweight? It'd be it'd be way worse, right? You don't want that. Also, all those memories, when you think about the happiest memories that you have with your kids, with your family, like those are going to decrease. You're going to have fewer of those because you physically can't do that.
(05:49) And so, the only thing easier than not take than taking action is not taking action at all. And so if these are the things that you want, you should do this thing because that way we can avoid this stuff. That's it. Very straightforward. And this is what constitutes our meat. Now I did a very simplistic example.
(06:08) If I want to make that more interesting, right? And if you want to like how do you create unique copy? This is a little advanced tip for you. All right. So pro tip, break down the terms. So what does it mean? So if I say you're going to feel better, right? That is not going to be compelling copy. I can promise you that right now. But what does feel better mean to somebody? How would I know that feeling better had occurred right in their life? And this is where you have to this is where the the research of like reading Amazon reviews for products that are similar in your space. Even if you sell services, read the positive reviews in their
(06:33) language of the things that they will say of why of what happened. What were the and the way I think about this here it is this is it. This is the big word that you need to double underline. Think in moments. What is the moment that someone think wow I feel better? What's the moment? what occurred, what happened, right? Maybe it's that they were able, let's say if it's an elderly population that were doing with this weight loss thing, um they were able to take the kid off the ground and pick him up, right? And they have this moment where after they had that little three, four-minute exchange, they're like, "Man, that was awesome. I couldn't do
(07:02) that before because I was so weak and I hadn't developed my my shoulder strength. I didn't have the mobility to do that." Like, wow, it's a moment. What else would it be? Maybe it's um you know, bending over to tie my shoe. I felt like I was getting out of breath because I had to like hold my hold my gut in so I could lean over to tie my shoes. That's gone now.
(07:20) Like what if there was a world where you just put both of them on and you could do it while you're standing, right? That's that's not out of reach. It's just a couple steps away from where you're at right now. Right? So if I say that I can describe all the things that someone might experience and then denote that they feel better without saying you're going to feel better.
(07:38) And so this applies for each of these elements of copy. And this is what makes copy potent. It's the specificity because you want someone to understand it within their own context of like, man, I've had that happen. And that's real. That's what makes you copy.
(07:57) And if that little copy tip was helpful for you, then I have pages and pages of of things that have helped me make uh good ads uh inside of the run paid ads chapter uh in page 129. So, I talk about um one, how paid ads work obviously, but secondly, where do you how do you write the copy? So I break down all the anatomy of ads in all of this.
(08:16) All these pages I'm talking about all of this is how you can make the ad. And so this is the level one framework. The level two that you put on top of this is who and when this is the what which again I also cover in the book. So we could talk about the prospect but we could also talk about that prospect status with regards to their spouse.
(08:33) Talk about with regards to their kids, talk about with regards to their frenemies, their rivals, their competitors, right? What is what are all these plus and minuses with regards to that that rival dad across the street or that rival business, right? What what do all those look like? And then how do we pace that for today? But then also the future, what does the future look like when things don't go the right way? Ooh, well that's going to be the bottom side. That's what happens if you don't take action, right? On the flip side, what
(08:56) does the future look like if things go well? Right? So we can play it out today, but also play it out tomorrow. And this gives you unlimited different angles to make the meat of your ad more compelling. And then the third thing is obviously the call to action which you want it to be as clear as humanly possible and tell them exactly what you want them to do and what will happen next.
(09:13) It's a key point that a lot of people miss. Not only do you want to say it, you want it to be demonstrated in the ad. So if I want someone to go to the next page, when I say go to the next page, I want the go to the next page to be visible because that way what happens is you have congruence. So and that has a couple levels of persuasion there.
(09:29) So number one in terms of congruence is people say okay I have set my expectations and they click and then their expectations are met and then what do you know? you have way fewer people who bounce off the page because the page looks exactly like I expected it to. Now what else happens? The person who actually made the recommendation, who made the suggestion to go to the page also increases in influence because when you say something's going to happen and then it happens, the person consciously or subconsciously doesn't matter.
(09:51) Science works either way. They will believe the next thing you predict with greater certainty. And so wouldn't you want people to be like, man, when that guy says something's gonna happen, that's what happens. that precedes or plants the seed for the sale that will inevitably come down the road.
(10:09) Now, once we have our ads, so now we're getting we're getting eyeballs, right? People are seeing the ads and then what are they doing? They're taking an action. All right, so this is my world's terrible mouse click. They click on the ad. I don't know, our little mouse is on fire, but we're just going to go with it.
(10:26) All right, the next step in this process is going to be the opt-in, right? We want them to give us their their information for something. and what are they going to give us the information for? So, typically it's going to be a lead magnet of some sort. Now, people have this big issue with like ah lead magnets are dead or lead magnets, you know, are are alive. I'll tell you this, bad lead magnets are dead.
(10:46) Good lead magnets certainly are alive and most lead magnets suck. And so, it's unsurprising that the vast majority of people who start to run ads the first time don't make money because their ads suck. And the first time you take a sales call, you probably suck because you don't know how to take a sales call. And the first lead magnet you make will probably suck, too.
(11:04) Now, I want to give you, in my opinion, the best lead magnet that I've ever seen in my whole life. All right? And so, it was actually in the dating space, and it was called uh how to know if a girl wants you to kiss her. Okay? Now, who wouldn't want to know if a girl wants to wants you to kiss her, right? And so, the simple answer to that, and this is the lead magnet, is try to brush her hair behind her ear. And if she moves her head away, then she doesn't want to kiss you.
(11:27) If she doesn't move her head at all or moves her head towards your hand, then she does. Very simple. All right, but the beauty of this is like, wait, so that's that could be a lead magnet. Of course, it could be a lead magnet. We want to solve the tiniest problem we possibly can for the prospect and completely solve it and blow them away.
(11:45) Now, some people are like, I made this full course. And there's nothing wrong with that, to be clear. I've got a whole bunch of them on my site. The thing is is there's going to be a certain amount of information that is required in order for a customer to make a decision. Period.
(11:58) Right? I would toss out the idea of emotional buyer, logical buyer, and just replace that. And this is how I think about it as high information and low information. How much information does someone need in order to make a purchasing decision? Some people need less, some people mean more. But if you provide more to everyone, you will close more people overall. And so, a lot of us are trying to add to straight money.
(12:15) And there are going to be those people who will just see an ad, watch a video, and then buy something. That happens. They are the minority. They are the crazy people. And we are grateful for them because they allow all of the machines to work. But for the other 97% of people, they usually need a little bit more time, a little bit more information in order to make the decision. And we have to facilitate that.
(12:35) So there's going to be two paths that people are going to selfidentify as we go through through this to maximize our monetization of the advertising that we do to make the most money. Now, the lead magnet I just explained, which was just have, you know, have the girl brush her uh sorry, brush the girl's hair behind her ear. You can fill it out.
(12:53) So, what what type of lead magnet is this? So, what I gave you is a one step to a multi-step solution. So, most people who are in the dating space aren't looking to just get a kiss, right? They're looking to find more dates. They're looking to, you know, eventually find a wife. Uh they're going to have to get into a relationship. They're going to maybe get married later. So, there's all these other problems that are going to have to happen outside of just figuring out if a girl wants to kiss you.
(13:12) If I don't have dates, I don't care. Now, this is neat, but I still have other problems I need to solve. But if you accurately solve that problem, because I'm like, I can understand why that would work. Then what do you think I'm gonna do next? I'm gonna believe that you could probably help me solve my other problems. So what I just outlined, you can come in real quick.
(13:29) So this is page 32 of the leads book, is the problem solution cycle, right? And there's many, many problem solution cycles that exist within a larger goal. The bigger the goal, the more problem solutions they have to go through, right? And so our lead magnitude has to solve one of these little problem solutions. So the little teaching the girl, you know, teaching the guy how to know if the girl wants to kiss him.
(13:47) It's not the big loop. It's just one of these tiny itty bitty loops. That's all it is. But now I think, well, who helped me solve that one? I'll bet you he could help me solve the rest of them. Now, what type of lead magnet is this? So the type lead, you could reveal a problem, which would be like the reason that you're not getting responses in your DMs is because of this.
(14:04) So if I show them a framework for what a DM supposed to be, I've revealed the problem of why they're not getting responses. Now, the other side of this is that I could say, "Hey, I'm going to give you a free trial of my dating thing." like this is another type of lead magnet. Now, this one is actually step three or type three of lead magnets, which is I'm giving away one step of a multi-step process to get an outcome, right? You're not just trying to get a girl to kiss you.
(14:27) You have to get responses and you have to set up dates and then you have to know how to talk on the dates. You have to know how to flirt beforehand and afterhand and I don't know what afterhand is, but apparently it's a thing, right? And so, you got you got after it and then it's like, how do I do the second date? How do I do the third date? What are smooth ways to to uh you know proposition a woman to whatever you get my idea.
(14:44) I'll stop there, you know, fill the rest in with your imagination, you know, and then propose. There we go. We just went straight to marriage, right? The whole thing is there's a lot of problems that are going to happen in this process and we don't need to solve them all.
(14:56) Think about think about a date a dating person who's like here's how to go from zero to married, right? Like that would be a lot. Like we just have to solve the problem that's in front of them today. Now, one of the other issues with the lead magnet is is it made for the right avatar? And this is a big one and this like people mess this one up a lot. All right.
(15:14) And so they're like, "Okay, well, how to make your first how to get your first five clients, right? I have some videos for that." But that's not my main avatar. Now, I am willing to help people out who are getting started, and that's okay. That's why I make those things. But is it is somebody who's just getting started my avatar today? No. But I'm betting on the fact that they will be years from now. But not because I want to give something to that person today.
(15:31) Right? And so if you have a spectrum of customers that you could potentially service, you want to make sure the lead magnet is perfectly fit for the perfect customer that you want. And if you haven't gotten clear on the type of customer you want, then you're certainly not going to be able to make the right lead magnet. Now, I have a free chapter. I think it's called uh you go acquisition.com.
(15:47) I think it's called avatar. I think that's what it is. But if you go your first avatar acquisition.com or I'm sure you can find it, but basically if you're not sure how to pick your avatar, that uh chapter explains it. It was actually kind of like a single that I released after the offers book. I recommend you check it out. Anyways, now once we have our lead magnet, we have their information.
(16:06) So, what is that going to lead to? We're going to need to lead to something that's going to sell them, right? Who's going to warm up the prospect? All right. And so, this is where we get our video sales letter. This is a VSSL, right? It's just a fancy term here. Fancy fancy.
(16:25) By the way, if you want an example of a lead magnet, this is one that we have. So you can check this out. So $100 million scaling grow map. This is for business owners, right? So if you're a business owner, you're trying to scale, then you're going to be at one of these 10 stages of scaling. And so what problem can I solve for you today? Well, if I can solve the current constraint in your business and show where uh this is, by the way, a reveal a problem type of of lead magnet.
(16:42) So I reveal the problem and then I also give you the solution to do this. But the thing is is if you see this and sometimes even just being, oh my god, this is exactly what I'm struggling with right now. Then it probably increases the likely that you think, okay, I think this guy could help me out.
(16:54) Simple as that. and it provides you more information to eventually make a decision. All right, so the lead magnet sets the stage and attracts the exact type of prospect that I want to work with, right? Someone with qualifications. But now we have to convert them. All right, and this is where our video sales letter comes into play.
(17:14) All right, so the video sales letter, the video that you have here is probably one of the highest leveraged things that you can create in terms of sales aids, right? Like if you get on if if a lot of times you're like, man, uh you know, ads don't work for me. It's not that ads don't work for you. It's that you haven't put enough friction in your process. And again, this is one of those things everyone's afraid of.
(17:32) Everyone's afraid of adding steps, adding friction, adding questions, adding qualifications, having people watch things in order to make a purchasing decision. But I promise you, if you look at your customers over the last however long, most of them, almost all of them will not have immediately bought something.
(17:50) Most of the times they will have consumed an hour, 2 hours, 3 hours plus of information from you in various formats before they decide to go through this process and ultimately buy. And so what we want to do is reverse engineer and facilitate this. Like the big finding I had when I was in gym launch was that 78% of customers had had consumed at least two long form uh pieces of content.
(18:08) Now I had podcasts, I had books, I had I had I had a group that I had kind of the video version of those podcasts. And so 78% had consumed at least two. So in thinking about this I was like okay so my average piece of long form content at the time was something the neighborhood of like maybe 17 to 20 minutes.
(18:27) So basically people had to consume call it an hour right of information from me in order to to be willing to book a call and be warm and potentially buy. And so I was like okay if that's what it takes why don't I try and force people to do that to become somebody who is likely to buy. If that's what 78% of people do in before buying, well then why don't I get a 100% of my people to do the thing that 78% do that are the ultimate buyers. That's the idea.
(18:53) So if you're like, okay, VSSL, what do I put inside this video? I'm going to walk you through a very simple frame. There's there's a bunch of different, you know, versions of VSSLs that you can run. I'm not going to get into that today, but people over complicate this. All right? They want to make this seem like this big box of black magic.
(19:10) And I've made so many video sales letters in my life that I can tell you there is no big box of magic. Um, and I'll give you two different structures that work really well. Okay, so structure one is actually very similar to a YouTube video. So you're going to go the five Ps, which is proof, promise, pain, plan, picture. Okay, so what does this mean? It means that I need to make some promise that they're going to get from this video. I need to talk about the pain to demonstrate that I know where they're at right now.
(19:35) I need to give them proof that they that they why they should believe me. And then I'm going to lay out the plan of how I'm going to help them solve it. And then usually I want that to be a visual so they can understand. Hence the visual, right? And then after I've done all of these things and I go through my plan, right? Duh. Here's my plan. Okay.
(19:53) After I have this kind of meaty part, then I'm going to have what I consider the FAQ section, which is what do people say when they get on the phone that they have questions about? I want to put all of the FAQs, every single one of them, into this video. I want to h I want to pre-handle the objections. And a lot of them are really sensical concerns.
(20:13) How long you've been doing this? How do I know this is legit? Answer all of their concerns in the video. And then finally, I just call it little proof proof stack at the end, which you should just put stories of successful customers, right? And you can put your CTA here. And then you put another CTA here saying, "By the way, uh, this concludes the video.
(20:31) At the end of this, it's just going to be a testimonial. You can watch those if you want." Now, when you say that, I'll just tell you this right now. You think that people won't watch them, people watch all of them. I'm just letting you know. All right? So, this is a version of a VSSL that works great.
(20:48) Another version, um, if you have something that is more well-defined, right? So, like if you're, when I say that, it's like if you if you sell a service that people, if I went on the street and said, "Hey, do you know what an electrician does? Do you know what HVAC person does?" and somebody understands that a little bit better, then I spend less time on this and I just go five W's, right? Which is, you know, who, what, where, when, why, and then I'll still have my FAQs, still have my proof stack, and still have my CTAs.
(21:11) This is basically two different versions of the meat. And guess what? Both have worked. But I thought there's this big box box of magic. All we're doing is answering all the questions that someone might reasonably have before making a purchasing decision so that when we get on the phone with them, we can just help them make a purchasing decision rather than having two calls where we're giving them information before they make a purchasing decision.
(21:30) So, right now, if you let's say that you're you run an ad campaign and you're like, man, it's taking me like three or four calls to close somebody. It's because this is the this is the magic of this. If it's taking you, you know, two or three calls, then that tells you that prospects need two or three hours of information in order to make a buying decision.
(21:48) And so, if you're efficient with it, those three-hour calls can probably be covered if you are specific in what the FAQs are and all the concerns and probably cover it in maybe 45 90 minutes if you're just very diligent about noting what the questions are.
(22:07) And I'll give you another pro tip on this, which is you want the FAQ to be in their language. So if someone says, "I'm really busy right now." You want to have a way to handle, "I'm really busy right now." Now, they might also say, "I've got a lot going on." Now, to you might you might be like, "Uh, cuz a salesman might think immediately, oh, well, that's just a timing objection." And the answer is yes, you're right.
(22:26) But the thing is is that someone might have six different ways of saying a timing objection. And you want to have an FAQ that covers each of those five or six ways because if you said that to a salesman and they said, "I'm really busy right now." And then you responded with uh how you would overcome someone saying, "I've got a lot of, you know, plate spinning.
(22:45) " You would actually have a slightly different overcome for that or objection handler. And so we need to basically say it in their language and then say the overcome that's appropriate to each of those things. So yes, that means you're going to have have to have an answer for their questions. But this should hopefully demystify all of the black voodoo magic around what is in one of these videos.
(23:02) You're just answering their questions. That's it. Now, I always get this question. Should I put my price in the VSSL or should I not put my price in the VSSL? The answer is it depends. All right. Now, the reason I say this is there are some businesses where um basically I tend to put price in in my stuff and that's because I have more demand than I can handle and I want to add friction to my process so I can maximally utilize um you know the the the sales team, right? Not waste their time. If I had an an underutilized sales team, then I'd be probably more willing
(23:34) to not have the the money qualification there. I will say this though, the longer I've been doing business, the more I just end up putting all the information up front and everyone's always afraid of, you know, what if I what if I tell them, you know, the the price.
(23:53) It's like they're going to find out eventually, right? So, I tend to try and cover as many things before the sales call as humanly possible. Okay, so now you've got an ad. They clicked. They got the free thing. Now they've got the the video sales letter, which by the way, pro tip, you can actually put the the lead magnet inside of the VSSL if you want to.
(24:11) Uh so you be like, "By the way, that thing about the girl thing, I'll tell you that in a second." Then you get to the first third of your VSSL. Then you can slice in the lead magnet and say, "Hey, by the way, this is that tip." And guess what? I have 28 other tips that you can follow, which I'll show you in this video.
(24:23) And then you go through it, right? Um so you can do either of those formats. Both of them work. But now we have to convert these people. All right? So, I'm going to put something here and then something here. Sorry that my little money that is a phone for everyone born before you know 2000 or after 2000. Okay, so what is band? I've talked about this before so I'm not going to hit on this a lot but you want to make sure they have budget authority need timing.
(24:47) Do they got the money to spend? They have the ability to make the decision. Do they need this thing? And is right now the time they want to buy? if we can answer those four things and you do that in the application or if you have auler right where they're booking a call you make sure that those are the questions that are being asked there and you only and here's the tough part you actually only take calls with people who say they have the money to spend they have the authority to make the decision they have the need and they're willing to move forward now how much easier of a call do you think it is when someone's
(25:11) gotten value from you they then fully understand the questions that someone might ask um around making purchasing decision from you they say they have the money the time they need the authority to do it now you're talking to them. How likely is it you think you're going to close them? Way higher than if you didn't have all that stuff, right? So, the reason that this process right here is the most efficient way of of converting traffic is that it's kind of like a microwave, right? You take someone from a cold prospect to a hot
(25:43) prospect. It's like you can, you know, you can slow cook it, you can simmer it, you can kind of bake it over time. I was like, or you can just nuke that thing. And so this is basically like nuking a prospect. How do we how do we just bomb them with all the because think about this.
(26:01) If someone's like, I followed you for a year, right? If someone followed short form for a year and let's say they consumed five pieces a week, which would be a crazy amount. It's 250 shorts. Well, the average shorts, let's just be generous here and say it's 30 seconds, which it isn't. All right. So that would mean that they've consumed 120 minutes, about 2 hours. Okay. So, we can have them consume 120 minutes over a year and then buy.
(26:19) They've gotten that much information in order to make a sale or we can just have them consume all two hours up front. And so, think about this like I think a lot about about um sales processes as a plane taking off. This is my like this is my Alex's very simple visual. All right. So, we've got our plane, right? This here's our plane.
(26:37) Let's put little wheels on our plane. I don't know. Just go with it. All right. Here's my plane. And we got to put a little the little backwing thing. O, this is tough. Okay, there's my there's my terrible plane. All right, the thing is is could this plane take off on this runway? No, the plane's too big.
(26:56) So, I have to increase the size of my runway to give this plane enough lift to take off. The size of this runway is the amount of information that you need to tell the prospect. And so, if we know that someone needs two hours to make a purchasing decision, then what do you think we've done? They consume a little bit here.
(27:12) They're going to consume, you know, maybe 30 to 45 minutes here, right? And then on the call, what do you think we're going to get here? Another hour. And so when we add all this together, they've gotten about two hours of information from us, but we did it in the span of a couple days rather than over a year, right? And this is why this is kind of like the the ramrod, the the fastest way of monetizing uh within a business.
(27:36) Now, what happens to all the leads that go through this process and don't necessarily want to purchase immediately? The logical people, the people that actually make sense and they're not crazy. Okay, so what do we do with all these people? Well, we want to put them somewhere that we give them long-term nurture where we just say, "Oh, you are just the type of person who needs more information to make a decision." No worries. Then I'm just going to give you more information and I'm going to do that provide more value over a longer period of time.
(27:53) And so that's where things like having a school group where you just dump all the extra leads into. And you keep making content there and you answer their questions there until eventually they're like, "Hey, I do actually want to take some action on this.
(28:04) " And then boom, you send them, you run them through the process, you microwave them again, you reheat them, right? And then boom, you make the sale, right? That's the idea. So, this long-term nurture, once people go through that, they're still going to come right back through the front door again and then get reheated. These are the four steps.
(28:23) You make your ads, you have a banger lead magnet, you have a VSSL, and then you qualify the person before the sale. And pro tip, you know, you know, 4.5 is that for everybody who doesn't buy, you have to put them in some sort of either email sequence or group or both where you continue to provide value. you continue to basically answer all these little FAQs that they've had because maybe they've got other ones or maybe they just need to see more approve. Some people just need more information to make the decision.
(28:41) That's all it comes down to. And when you do that and you provide as much information as possible, you convert a way higher percentage of the audience. So, let me give you the the massive pro tip, the thing that took me way too long to understand.
(28:53) What do you think a brand is? We're giving someone tons of information over a long period of time about who who we are, what we're about, our way of doing things. And so the reason that brands grow significantly bigger than the people who just do this, like if you just do this, you're going to be able to make some money, but you will quickly cap. You'll be able to make money, but you will cap.
(29:12) To build the brand, we have to have this thing be enormous. And then this thing ends up being our eyeballs at the front of this so that we have this enormous audience of people that have gotten value from us day in and day out for an extended period of time. That is then what over time if you it's like I think about it like this.
(29:37) It's like you've got this this this pyramid of people who are interested in your stuff, right? And this is as they you know get more information, right? They move up the pyramid. And so all we're going to do is we're going to have these people are the ones who give us money and all these people aren't going to do anything.
(29:48) They're just going to get they're just going to be like, man, this guy's great or this gal is great, right? So if we want to grow this this this little this little slice here, what do we do? Grow the bottom. We grow the base. And this fundamentally is what growing a brand is about. You're growing the base so that the top of the pyramid is way bigger than over here where you have to try and take someone up the elevator using the four-step process that I just walked through.
(30:08) So, that is my blueprint for unlocking your business's maximum monetization potential. And if you want to understand this even more in depth, uh, then you'll love this video where I actually do a full live breakdown of a business owner's funnel. Enjoy.

I Challenged My Team To Replace Themselves with AI - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z7X95bn2T6A

Transcript:
(00:00) I told my entire team to replace themselves with AI in a week here's the nine AI tools they came back with across sales marketing HR training recruiting and operations let's start with sales our deal team talks to hundreds of prospective businesses every single month now they've implemented two AI tools to replace themselves first to increase show up rates for meetings we now send personalized videos of me using entirely AI hey Jordan hey Josh Hey Kevin Hey Michael Nathan Ryan you passed our initial screen congratulations
(00:28) huzzah so this saved them all the time and missed calls and all the time I would have to spend manually saying hey Johnny hey Dave I never said any names now to do that they asked me to record one video just one the AI would cut in and replace my mouth and move it in the right way to say a name that I never spoke now on top of that the deal team does a lot of emailing so they wanted to have a more effective way to write email follow-ups which normally can take 10 to 20 minutes a pop two hours plus per day and so they use compose.ai and so here's
(00:56) an example of what that looks like right after a call in action now if you think about the breakdown of how much they replaced two hours per day on a 40 Hour Work Week means 25 percent more output for the same cost that's when for me it's a win for them because value is created next my content team came to me and how they were going to replace themselves they used three different tools to get 250 pieces of content out per week first off they wanted to give everybody in mosination more ways to consume my stuff so they added audio
(01:21) versions of any email or any tweet that I post that I never actually read these are actually just me tweeting all day no one writes my tweets but me you could actually use the same voice over tool which was resemble AI to send voice memos to prospects create entirely custom text and then send it as a voice member that you can record in real time it's freakishly like me and it was only with about 10 minutes of training 90 of them come while I drink coffee in the morning in between sets when I work out and to give you a quick look into the
(01:50) future podcast at AI actually scraped all of Joe Rogan's podcasts to get his voice down it's entirely possible and this is a clip from the intro of one of their podcasts entirely generated by AI another episode of the Bro jogan experience on this episode I welcome my friend who's difficult to describe how's it going good to see you buddy it's been a long time since I've been on the show so in the future audiobooks may just be recorded entirely through AI because the author's voice can be duplicated and they don't have to spend three days
(02:19) recording the book or every blog post will have an audio version that everyone can listen to and the best part is for me is that the team doesn't have to kind of disrupt my day hey can you record this thing for it'll only take 30 seconds that 30 second disruption might take 30 minutes for me to get back on track the second tool that they use to replace themselves is something called runway.
(02:37) ai This is for image editing and some other stuff too but we're using it mostly for images right now so what used to take 30 minutes to edit out an object or replace my shirt or change the color of my hat we can now do in seconds on the flip side you could also edit out an entire figure put whatever background they want behind it on top of that if you've ever needed to remove background sound you ever have one of those you're like where where was this massive fan in the background in a few clicks you can remove all of the backgrounds sound of
(03:01) an audio for any kind of video and they can do it in seconds the third tool they used was descript all right this is pretty slick for a couple reasons number one is for editing it can get straight to the point of a video where I say specific things so if you've ever been like man I know there's this point in this video that are recorded that's 38 minutes long rather than mindlessly clicking play and trying to speed it up and trying to pay attention while also trying not to doze off instead of all that it transcribes the entire video and
(03:23) you can just pick the part where you say the thing and it goes straight to it so rather than trying to find it through video watching you can find it straight in the text if they don't have to spend two hours today looking for different clips sifting through like pause rewind pause rewind then they can spend the rest of that time think about how they want to package the video what sound or what music they want to use to evoke an emotion and that is going to take a video from a hundred thousand views to a million views eventually I was gonna be
(03:47) able to do that too though let's switch gears to training one of the most expensive things for any new company is that they have to onboard new people after you've already gone through the process of interviewing tons of candidates and taking them through first round second round third round interviews now you've given them the job they're in they're still useless because they don't know how your company Works they don't know your values they don't know the Cadence they don't know the communication structure they don't have
(04:03) meetings all these things they have to repeat over and over and over again and it's time consuming my director of people came to me and said hey we can actually create all the onboarding videos using AI thanks for applying with acquisition.com my name is Jessica I am an AI generated member of the acquisition.
(04:20) com team what's cool about this is you can have a living document that you update as things change so instead of going to a studio setting everything up and then reshooting an entirely new video you just change the text and boom make sure to click that like button the video changes instantly if it's not perfect I wouldn't worry about it because it will be soon if you speed up AI videos I've noticed that it sounds a lot more human make sure to click that like button all trainings can be just done straight through text and then the Avatar can deliver them this is
(04:42) hundreds of hours of human labor that is just getting eliminated so there are two things that increase productivity per worker one is education and the other one is technology when you have ai based education you're actually using both the person who was doing the training is now using technology to save the time the person who's receiving the training is now becoming educated and as a result becoming more productive now let's shift gears over to recruiting our recruiters recruit top talent for our portfolio
(05:08) companies check out how our recruiters are using Tavis to create more personalized Outreach I was talking with Alex ramosi and they said you should totally check out acquisition.com if you only go through using job boards to get your talent then you're only getting people who are dissatisfied and want to leave but the highest producing people are always employed and so if you want to have personalized Outreach to get the best talent consider using stuff like this then they hop on a candidate interview after every candid interview
(05:32) you take notes on the candidate and that serves two purposes one is if the person isn't a good fit you send them notes about why they're not a good fit and you wish them the best on the flip side if they are a good fit you want to take those notes and pass them on to the next person so they have more context otter AI solve that by taking notes on these interviews and timestamps this saves our recruiters 10 to 15 minutes per call per day if you can now get more productive interviews then it means you can get
(05:54) more productive people into your business and then the savings on that are probably incalculable now let's shift to my operations team so our admin for internal meetings began using AI to attend meetings and take notes on her behalf now instead of having to sit on meeting after meeting after meeting to take notes so they could report back to the executives fireflies AI will take meetings and they can just look at the meeting notes in probably a tenth of the time compared to sitting in on each of those meetings and then they can
(06:18) consolidate them they use chat GPT for that and they can send it to us you can now have visibility into your entire organization in a way that you couldn't ever before now let's talk about the most expensive resource in every company time and the number one time waster of time those awkward like 30 15 minute 45 minute white spaces between meetings and it's not enough time to do any deep works you just basically sit there and waste your time waiting for the next thing to start that doesn't have to happen anymore so what our Ops team did
(06:43) was get the entire team under reclaim AI to reshuffle calendars in real time to maximize output of an entire Company by wait for it 40 rather than have thousands of emails every single day simply trying to coordinate times it can do that by seeing everyone's transparently and then making it it so that there are as few blank spaces as possible on everyone's calendars and the biggest project that we're using robots and AI for at acquisition.
(07:08) com is building our new holdco headquarters we figure if we use robots we can have them work around the clock not need to take time off not have sexual harassment complaints and we have no fear of them getting injured okay that one was a joke but in the not too far future it won't be

She Turned 5800 Followers Into $1 Million Per Year - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) you want to hear something that's going to blow your mind $1 million in profit from less than 6,000 Instagram followers what I want to walk you through is a story of a business owner that I just recently met doing those exact numbers from a tiny audience and what you can use from those strategies for yourself to get started making big money even if you have a small audience I had the most insane thing happened last night and it has had me at a loss for words I was actually at a loss for words like speechless befuddled bewildered and I
(00:33) was like what is going on and it took a concept that I kind of believe in and I've made some moves around it and it took it to the absolute hyperbolic extreme that you could imagine and it's still held true and I think that for business owners who are listening to this for people who make content who are listening to this but just in this is going to I mean it it has it has slightly nudged how I see the world and I'll just put it that way and I feel like a lot of the beliefs I have around the world are still relatively
(01:01) I I I hold on I believe them pretty pretty strongly so here's what happened so um we had a company come in um and the the the lady who owns the company is a registered dietitian and I'm not going to shout her I would shout her out because I want her to get all the Kudos in the world but I don't want it to mess up what she's doing and so that's why I'm going to keep it Anonymous so she's a registered dietician she takes home just under a million dollars a year helping other registered dieticians Bill Insurance correctly and so it's super
(01:33) niche in terms of what she's really good at so she knows how to be an RD and help people Bill Insurance codes properly and so the average uh I think dietitian adds like $100,000 in income using just like her kind of coding system for billing them right crazy Niche crazy crazy Niche and so um I spent I spent some time with her we talked about her business and things I was like hey I think you move this stuff around and I think that the business could probably do about 3 million a year to 5 million a year in profit if she just moved some of the
(02:01) things around that we talked about and so I was like cool this is great and so we had dinner and I was like hey let me see your your your your Instagram so I just wanted to pull it up because I was going to make a point about something because I assumed that she had like I wanted to see what kind of con that she had assumed that she had at least a relatively large following I honestly hadn't looked shame on me and this is what happens I pull it up number one her account is not verified and I'm like this is your number one source of income
(02:30) and you were not paying $4.99 a month like what are you doing what are you doing and I after after yelling at her for that I then was then drawn to the next natural absolutely unbelievable thing that I'm going to say to you she had 5,800 followers her average post got 19 likes and like one comment and 100% 100% of her acquisition came from her organic Instagram with just under 6,000 followers I pulled up her account stats because I was losing my mind seeing the amount of sales that she was making off of this account her her
(03:08) account her reach for 30 days of her account was 2,800 that was her reach 2800 like for context I do about 20 million a month context and I was like what is happening right now like what am I what do I not what is what is going on how is this possible and so she's doing 10 plus sales a day at a low ticket price and doing 3ish sales a week at a higher ticket price and when I say higher ticket I'm talking like you know4 $5,000 um type price point and then a lower ticket thing for just like some cheat sheets of like here's all the
(03:47) codes and this is how you can do them whatever and a 10 a day a day okay and so this this is that's that's the big story now I'm going to zoom out and I'm going to say what I think is so cool about this so she says this and I was like how how how are you doing this and she's like you know what I I got my first sale when I had eight people on my email list eight eight and I was like that's nuts and she was like yes it was really confirming for me that like there people were listening and so I was like well how big
(04:22) is your email list now and she's been doing this for a few years I've not I told 2,900 people on our email list and she makes sales for emails and it was such a great reset for me it was such a good nudge as a reminder that the view count you have on the other side the 19 likes like there's a real person on the other side of this that is watching your clip that has five views there's a real person who's opening up your emails when you have a list that has 300 people on it like people are watching people are listening
(05:02) and the thing that was unique that I found about her I'll say two things and I think that there's a really good meta concept here one is she her content was consistent and she said yeah I do one post and I do one story every day and I like but she was like super proud of it I was like this is adorable and also crazy but the posts that she talks about 100% of them are about billing insurance as a registered dietician like could not be more Niche couldn't like you couldn't even think of one right for I couldn't even imagine one and
(05:32) despite that she's making the sales that she is and so I'm going to zoom out on this because I think it's really interesting so if you if you go to my Alex's homepage right like as a user of Instagram my user page I've showed this to people because people are like this is really weird all I have is philosophy stuff comedy and gym equipment like that's my whole feed I have no news I have it's philosophy comedy and gym equipment because that's what I look at and what's interesting is that the philosophy is kind of a lot of those are
(05:59) kind of like midsize the comedy comedians are mass market so a lot of those guys are bigger but I get tiny comedians like 5,000 follower 10,000 follower comedians get shown to me all the time because Instagram knows I like comedy and equipment dealers and Equipment manufacturers and metal fabricators not always the best marketers and so like the these accounts that I follow there have like 500 a th000 like 2,000 like they're not huge accounts but I get served everything in that space on Instagram because that's
(06:29) what I'm into and so I think that there's a couple really interesting things here one is that I think that Niche content will make you a hell of a lot more money if that's what you're actually selling and I have here's the thing I have learned this lesson twice so I like to you know I like to pretend that I'm you know I uh I like to think I'm a fancy businessman who learns all these lessons but I I have messed this up two times not two times and so I tell the story about how my podcast was getting you know two
(06:58) 3,000 downloads uh per month which is like 100 downloads an episode not a lot right but and that was for like a few years but I don't tell you this other part of the story which is that my podcast started growing in numbers when I started talking about General business it also started growing in numbers even faster once we sold the company for gym launch but there was a period of about 18 months prior to me selling where I just talked about General business because I was like I'm tired of talking about gyms I just want to talk about
(07:26) business in general during that period of time our organic sales went to basically zero and it took us like six months to figure out that the reason that that had happened was because I stopped talking about gym [ __ ] and gym owners were like less interested in my content than generic business cont do that make sense like if you if you're just if you're a business owner you're going to listen to business stuff in general if you're a dentist then you're going to get a lot out of a dentist only podcast right but
(07:54) there's not that many dentists so you're not going to get a lot of listens but the listens in terms of relevancy is going to be through the roof and so we started making less sales but I was getting more views more listens right now I ended up wanting to go in that direction so it was fine and I'm talking about General business now right I made that mistake second time not necessarily a mistake we learned right um three to six months ago we were like let's experiment with some wider content and by experimenting with wider content we
(08:18) sure as hell got more views more more a bunch of other vanity metrics but the number of business owners that was watching and the way I I measured that was uh our cpms on our videos on YouTube the amount of people who opt in it out acis.com people who buy our books all of those all of those metrics were actually down despite our views being up and so this little story that I have of the dinner that I had last night blew me away because it just showed how much you can really make if you have a DieHard audience that doesn't need to be big
(08:47) less than 6,000 followers her account reaches less than 2,800 accounts per month and she's taking home almost a million dollars a year that's income not Revenue I'm just talking profit and right now if she just take makes the couple of obious VI changes that she can make she'll probably make somewhere in the $3 to5 million a year range income income and if you're looking to make your first dollar online or monetize your audience no matter what the size is school.
(09:15) com games is the easiest way that I know how to do it I take a call once a week inside of that Community to answer questions for people who are getting started I have a step-by-step course that lays out what exactly to do to make your first dollar online and once a month I drop 8 hours of training from the top 10 community business owners showing exactly what they're doing to scale their communities today school.
(09:33) com s/ games you can start for free and I say this because there's there's two angles on this right on on one side people are like well I don't want to start making content because what if I have low numbers I believe now the algorithms are so good that if you make it about one specific type of thing it's going to show it to those people and right now Al by the way like the guy who runs uh Instagram talked about he's actually favoring smaller creators now so that's a good thing if you're if you're trying to get into it but beyond
(09:58) that I think there's so much power in and when I talked to her she's like I just want to show up she's like I show up whether there's no one there's one person and I just I I show like like it's a whole Auditorium she said this thing and I have just noticed this with [ __ ] winners right it's like they're doing it because of what they because she's a missionary she just genuinely wants to help regro dietician she's like I get it I worked at the hospital do 100 hours a week and like I was under you know under staffed underbuild and I had
(10:24) to start making this business work on my own doing one day a week so I had to figure out how to do this quickly in terms of all this spilling stuff and she's she gets so passionate when she was talking about it I I've confidence she's not going to change industry she been in 20-some years like she's not going anywhere she loves this stuff and the people who stay in the game the longest like the game they're in and so I have this thing that I I I heard from last dance which is the Michael Jordan documentary which if you haven't seen
(10:48) you should totally see it and they're they're interviewing Jordan and they're like why do you br you like you bring such a high intensity every single time you show up to the arena and he says this line and I remember getting ch when I heard it he was like I just never know I know that there's one guy who's bringing his son and they saved up for months to go to this one Bulls game and that's the one it's not going to be some prime time night it's just going to be a random Tuesday game in a series he's like and that's the only time they're
(11:16) going to see me play in their lives he's like and I want I want to perform for them for that kid for that for that Dad who wants to impress his son and like that that like I almost get choked up when I tell that story because um like that's so real for me um and the way that she brought the energy like the energy she brought in terms of how she wanted to show up when there's eight people on her live or two people on her live or when there were eight people on her email list and she made her first $39 sale I was like this is real and
(11:46) people need to hear this which is why I wanted to tell the story because I think it's absolutely insane and it just it put like I say what I say right which is hey guys like start making you know start making content start promoting yourself if more people know about your stuff you're going to make more money period period fight me right that's that's what it is but you just forget sometimes that like when you have 10 views on a YouTube video that's 10 people and I remember when I was in the gym world if I had 10 people that I
(12:09) could talk to I was stoked right in the fact that we can do this from home behind a camera my God how amazing is that and so like if I had 25 people my God that's like that's like a talk that's like a that's like a workshop you a lunch and learn that you do as a business owner try and get business the fact that you can make a niche content Instagram will serve it to only people who very interested in that I only like gym equipment and I get gym equipment stuff all the time got like 13 likes on it but I see it right I see it because
(12:33) Instagram knows and the algorithms only get better and so um I wanted to cover all that stuff because I thought it was really important um and from a from a how do you how do you make this she has endless sources of content because she just literally answers their questions they just keep she was like I was like so where do you get stuff for she's like oh they all have questions and so I just I just make my posts answering their questions that's it and I will say this I think she could do a lot of things better to be clear but like she just had
(13:05) every other post just had a by the way there's a link in my bio that has more stuff that you might like that was it that was the whole strategy and she was doing a million dollars a year take-home just under and so I was just blown away by this and I I find it actually one of the most hopeful messages that I have seen in in person in a very long time and so people have you know like unless I have 100,000 followers not be able to make money unless I have T the thing is is that people seek the followers with the idea
(13:33) that the followers are going to make them Rich the followers will make you famous understanding business will make you rich she understands business she's like I'm just going to talk to the people that I want to serve and I'm only going to serve them and I'm going to answer all the questions and the way she talked about she's like I just want to be useful she's like I just want to help him out and so if you're coming into the frame rather than like I want this piece of content to perform and think there's eight people on either side I just want
(13:57) them to be better off and hopefully answer their question from this piece of content they making you will get raving fans even if your audience is 5,000 people but there's a there's a book I can't remember the guy who wrote the name of the book but he says you only need a thousand true fans and I think that so like a thousand fan like you can you can do whatever you want with a thousand fans even at 10 bucks a month right like you can make $100,000 a year if you just do that right thousand true fans that are die hard and you can make
(14:23) a lot more than that with a thousand true fans and so people think because we have this 8 billion people in the world that you need to be you need to be the Barack need to be Kim Kardashian need to be Mr Beast and sure with massive numbers like those like you're going to get famous those things are are required but like you can make an absolute killing just talking about what you're really good at and that's the other piece here is that I I'm I'm half I'm shatting this at myself too which is like we we we made piece of marriage
(14:49) content a couple you know a couple relationship stuff a little bit of Fitness stuff and the thing is is like there's there's no relationship billionaire like the the only objective measure of if your marriage is good just from a society standpoint is that you are not divorced that's it and then it's that measured by how many years you put up with each other that's it and I don't like that because it's one of those it's one of those crappy things where everybody's been in a relationship so everybody has an opinion and there's no objective
(15:19) proof that one thing is better than another and so like I hate I don't like making content in that space we tried it out because like we have a unique relationship Lea and I and we like what we do and it's worked for us well but um I would say that I have more credibility uh in business and so she has credibility in not just she doesn't talk about nutrition at all she just talks about how to be a restro dietician and Bill Insurance properly and get credentialed and do this whole process that apparently is a big pain in the
(15:49) butt and so if you are somebody who has a very specific Niche that you're that you're good at I would highly encourage you to just make the content that gets 40 views that gets 100 likes that you know for sure will help a very specific person because when you do help that very specific person they will like you a lot more than many people who like you a little bit and the people who like you a lot are the ones who buy from you and that's the thing and I I I'm making this because I need to remind myself of this
(16:22) which is like you can either be rich or you can be famous you can obviously be both but honestly sometimes it's a lot faster to just just get rich and many of you get in the game because you want to make money from social media from making content from things like that from advertising the business you want to do more of that get your face out there whatever but you start chasing the views because the views is what the algorithm right encourages but the business side this is why I'm trying to make this point is that the metrics don't
(16:48) necessarily follow the van your business metrics don't follow your vanity metrics there and so just because you get more views doesn't mean you get more Revenue just because you get more subs doesn't mean you get more optins right for your website or for whatever it is that you that you sell you don't get sales from that stuff subscribers don't mean sales and so there are there are tons of stories of tiny channels we have uh we have an insurance brokerage that we own um and the the the head of the insurance
(17:15) brokerage has like when when we when we invest in the company had I think like 5,000 followers on Instagram or Sor not on Instagram on on YouTube and the business is doing many millions of dollarss a year I'll just be that be very clear there many millions not just one or two and it's because he talks about a very complex structure of insurance that that he specializes in he's one of the foremost experts and his videos get like 100 to 500 views but those 100 to 500 views are people who are looking for incredibly high-end very
(17:46) specialized Insurance products and so don't be afraid of the empty room very low views doesn't mean low Revenue it just means that it's more specific and that you're talking to a more specific person and a specific problem being solved for a specific person is how you make big money and so I want I thought this was one of the most hopeful messages that I had seen in real life in a long time and it was really confirming for me it also doubled down on the direction that we're doing which for those you said I said mistake
(18:19) made the mistake twice um we have come back to going back to business baby only business uh only Alex only business only for the fans just kidding um and uh and I I hope you I hope this at least encouraged you to just divorce yourself more and more from the vanity metrics around it because I am now leaning so hard to this because our business metrics and I have a big long thing that's coming out soon um have skyrocketed since we stopped going anything that's not business and so I feel so confirmed in this direction that
(18:51) I want to encourage as many of you as humanly possible to just toss out the vanity metrics because they do not [ __ ] matter if you're trying to make money if you're just trying to get famous then yeah but I means it's great metric for fame right um and so yeah just do that be willing to have a th000 fans make stuff that has 19 likes because you know that the 19 people who liked it were like this was unbelievable for me and they will take the next step and they will purchase from your business keep being awesome have an
(19:19) amazing day bye

Dangerously Honest Advice to Create Generational Wealth - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m-k0_pQJ1fY

Transcript:
(00:00) If you're watching this video, you probably want to create generational wealth. And guess what? It's not like rich kids are born with higher IQs. We already know that. But they do have advantages. So, what are those advantages? Beliefs and skills. I'm going to do my absolute best to share as many of these in this video as humanly possible.
(00:18) Number one, don't despise wealth. Understand that ethical wealth creation is possible. If you secretly despise wealth, it will elude you. You can't hate rich people and then at the same time want to become one. Now, I mean, I guess you could, but it'd be kind of weird. And so some poor parents unintentionally teach their kids that money is scarce and that rich people are greedy or bad.
(00:36) Now the flip side is that wealthy parents teach that money is everywhere and that creating value deserves some sort of reward through exchange. And that's fun that's the fundamentals of capitalism is voluntary exchange. Key word is voluntary. Two people choose to interact, choose to make a trade.
(00:54) And the beautiful thing about capitalism is both people say thank you. It's one of the only things in human nature where people do things and both people say thank you. You go to the cash register, you buy the shoes, the store owner says thank you and you say thank you. Both people have a net positive sum from the exchange and that's how overall economies grow.
(01:11) If you want to grow your own personal economy, the idea is how can I create as many of these positive sum exchanges as possible? And if you do enough of those positive exchanges, like why would you not want lots of people to thank you? Well, because if a lot of people thank you, then it means that you were doing something good that people will exchange money for. And if you do that a lot of times, you'll have a lot of money. How did this somewhere get distorted? Now, a lot of that's media.
(01:28) And you know, I'll try to make my own version of of media so that I can have a very small voice that says something a little different. But at the end of the day, money is just a tool. It allows you to exchange. It's literally just an intermediary for exchange. And as a result, it will lubricate the number of exchanges that you make.
(01:46) If you're somebody who tends to do bad stuff, when you have more tools to do bad stuff, you do more bad stuff. If you are a quote good person, I won't even try to define that, but let's just say good person who has a tool, they will be able to do more good stuff. You're probably not going to be able to create generational wealth if you hate money.
(02:04) But most people can't even take a shot because they actually believe in one of the biggest lies that's out there is that passive income equals BS. Now, let me explain. Passive to you means active to someone else. There's always someone who is active. It's less of a binary of active versus passive and it's a continuum.
(02:22) And so it's like where do you live on this continuum? Let's say this is all active and this is all passive. It's very rare that you have things that are purely here. Now you can absolutely buy a dividend ETF and like the only thing that's not passive about that is making all the decision and doing all the research in order to do that and whatever work you did in order to get the money.
(02:38) But beyond that, yes, the dividend that you get from that would be passive. The thing is is that most people who see rich people assume that they have all of this passive money that's coming in. All the richest people that I know for sure have passive income, but they've got way more active income.
(02:56) Most people are trying to like get rich on passive when they're like make active income cool again. I I'll tell you a story. We own an advisory practice as part of acquisition.com, right? Which is where it's functionally like management consulting. We go, you know, we go in, we look at a company, we help them grow. That's what we do, right? It's actually true custom work. It's not like courses and coaching or anything like that.
(03:11) is it's like we actually have it's unfortunate that the internet space just like automatically assumes that that's what everything is but like all the guys that I have are exhort xmbbas x mckenzie xbcg xbane like consultants right that work with big companies and that's because we can help companies grow.
(03:26) I work with some companies in a very very you know acute format where I'll spend a day with call like 10ish founders and we'll go really deep on some of the strategies in their business and they pay for that and someone might see that and say Alex why would you trade time for money? Well, think about it like this.
(03:44) If I'm going to work no matter what, so let's just say Monday through Friday I work 12 hours a day, 60 hour week. So if I'm going to work Monday through Friday and I have something else that can make me more money for that time, why would I not do it? Because then I can turn around and take that active income and then say, "Hey, maybe I'm going to take some of that and trade it for some money over here. It's a little bit left.
(04:02) It's a little bit moving that way." And over time, you just increase the amount that you make per hour on the active side. and then you have a percentage that goes on passive. But the thing is is that as you become more and more skilled, your active will proportionally increase.
(04:19) The TLDDR is people will spend a h 100red hours trying to make a $100 a month passive when they could have just made $10,000 getting paid for their active time. That's a bad trade. And so what everyone seems to forget is that the people with passive income often had passive income first. It's like going to the gym.
(04:36) You have to put in the active work in the gym for a very long period of time before eventually you can have a passive body. meaning like you can just work out once a week and more or less maintain your physique, but it takes a long time to get there. And so, everybody trades their time for money. It's just about how much leverage you get, how much you get per hour in. And so, max out your active earning hours first until you have truly gotten all your passive to the point where it can pass your current lifestyle. But the thing is is the vast majority of people that I've met who've made a tremendous amount of money usually have a period of
(05:04) time where they do the cocktails on the on the beach and then they come back and they say, "Yeah, that wasn't for me." To a person, like I'm talking like I can't even think of one off the top of my head that hasn't said that. It's just this myth. And the thing is is the myth keeps you poor because you make those trades.
(05:22) You spend a,000 hours working so you can make $1,000 a month rather than taking the thousand hours and continuing to uplevel your skills so you can trade those hours for higher dollars. So, I'll give you I'll give you a business example for you. And this is this is going to be a little bit a little bit more advanced, but bear with me. So, let's say that you've got the opportunity to have a $10 per month customer, okay? And that person's going to stay for 60 months. Okay? Now, people would see this and say, " $10 a month? That means it's super low churn.
(05:45) This much be a very valuable business." Blah blah blah blah blah. If you could get that same customer to pay $1,000 upfront for a lifetime deal, should you do it? Yes. Yes. $1,000 is worth more than 600. But the thing is is that people obsess about this and forget about this and they do this in their businesses and they do this with their time.
(06:09) And so once you focused on active income, you need to understand something that separates wealthy from everyone else who stays stuck. Number three, it's your fault. So let me explain. These three words will get you out of poverty. It's my fault. So one of the best ways to stay poor is blame everyone else for your problems.
(06:29) And I want to be clear, it might not be your fault, but it still is your problem. And so maybe I should better say this to less trigger people, but it's your problem. And so no one else is going to solve it for you, right? Your trauma is real. Your problems are valid. And absolutely no one is coming to save you. And once you accept that, you become dangerous.
(06:45) It actually doesn't matter if it's your fault, but it is your problem. You have to solve it because no one else will. And that allows you to actually do something about it. My dad came to this country with $1,000 to his name, but he bought me a lot of lessons, including accountability.
(07:01) If my father had been a hedge fund manager, managing $20 billion, I would have a very different life. I knew what Baltimore rich was, right? My dad's a doctor. But then I eventually saw what Vanderbilt and New York money was, New York finance money, New York real estate money. I was like, "Holy cow." And so I was rubbing shoulders with some of the world's all these people when I went there.
(07:17) And I it like completely shifted my worldview of like honestly just what was possible. beliefs, declarative knowledge, knowing about something. I didn't know this was possible. I didn't know about this stuff. Investment banking, I had never heard of it. M&A, mergers and acquisitions, private equity, I didn't heard of any of this stuff. Literally, the highest income vehicle I had heard of at the time was just become a doctor.
(07:35) And doctors make good money. I like I genuinely like my goal was $100,000 a year. So, I say this so that you guys like don't think like I I somehow like sprang into existence with billion dollar aspirations. Like I just wanted to make a hundred grand. That was the goal for a while.
(07:54) And the thing is is that average parents will blame the economy, the government or the system. They say we have these disadvantages. It's harder for people like us. They'll say those things and more importantly their kids will believe them and then as a result change their behavior to make it antithetical or unlikely to them actually getting out.
(08:11) And so their parents hurt their kids to protect their ego. And I'm saying both egos. They protect their child's ego and they protect their own ego. But if they were able to say, "We're not rich because I don't have the skills and I never learned them, but I want you to." And so, how do you operationalize this? Going all the way to the bottom, you use what you've got.
(08:32) So, once you figure out that it's your fault, people wait for perfect conditions to start when in reality, starting is the perfect condition. And that's when you can start actually making decisions that lead to wealth. like understanding principle number four, solve rich people's problems. You solve rich people problems because they pay better.
(08:49) And when you solve rich people problems, you get to charge rich people prices. And here's why this matters. If somebody got $100 in their bank account and you're asking for 50, you're asking for 50% of their net worth. So for them, it's a very important decision. But that same $50 might be less than 1% of a rich person's net worth. So they don't even care.
(09:07) It would just be the equivalent of trying to sell $1 to that person with $100 in their bank account, right? they probably would barely even notice it, right? And so most parents teach kids to get a job serving anyone who will hire them. Wealthy parents teach kids to target specifically high value markets with specific problems that higher skills can help solve.
(09:31) Focusing on serving valuable markets, not just any market, is what they transfer to their kids. I mean, the easiest way to figure out where the money's at is to look at who's already rich and see what they're doing. Thing is like, no one gets rich on passive income. They get rich on active income and then it goes passive and then they talk about it. But here's where most people go wrong even when they're solving valuable problems.
(09:48) They're obsessed with the wrong side of the wealth equation, which is number five, and this is going to ruffle some feathers. You want to prioritize earning over saving. So, one of the biggest mistakes poor people make is they think they can save their way to wealth.
(10:04) The truth is, it's better to focus on how to 10x your income than save an additional 10%. Because the thing is is that at the absolute hypothetical max, all you can do is save 100%. You could live on nothing. You could live on the streets and somehow show up to work or whatever it is that you do to make money and save 100% of what you make.
(10:21) But the thing is, if you're making $30,000 a year, it's just like it takes forever, even at 100%. This is not an efficiency problem. This is an absolute volume issue. You have an income problem, not a not a spending issue. As much as people are irresponsible with their spending, and they are, I think they're more irresponsible with with how little they try to optimize their earning. I'll give you a couple very easy examples.
(10:41) You can do the exact same job in a different city and make 30 to 40% more and work remote. You can just work remote to a different company and make significantly more money. And what's crazy to me is that people don't just like consistently apply to jobs that make more money even just in the job market.
(10:58) Like, why wouldn't you? If you're incredibly poor right now, like someone will take a shot on you. And you know what? You might just learn something that you can take with you for the rest of your life. And you also get this crazy thing called experience, which also stays with you. You gain evidence. This is the simplest example I can give you. What I just explained was arbitrage. The other version is just an arbitrage of time.
(11:17) So let's say that you instead of saving, let's say you have the option, let's say you have $500. This is actually a real question. Somebody messaged me and said, "I have $1,000 in my bank account. What should I invest in?" And they actually said, "What stock should I invest in?" There was a DM I got.
(11:34) And it was so interesting because I was like, "Man, I can't believe he would ask me this question because it's so absurd. It misses the point." But like, this is why I'm making this video, right? Is that that $1,000 will literally never become anything. Now, you might be like, "Man, if I put $1,000 into Bitcoin in 2013, let me let me pull you off the ledge for a second." So, if you had done that, you would have $121,000.
(11:52) Can't retire on that. I mean, it's I mean, you can live for a couple years, but you're not going to do much with that. The point is is that they're trying to hit hit these meme coins. They're trying to figure out, you know, like whatever other BS, but the question automatically was wrong because he was optimizing around the wrong vehicle.
(12:12) He thought he was going to passive income his way or even hit it big. But the issue is that you can't retroactively look at one decision and say, "What if I put all my money in Bitcoin in that year? I would be so rich right now. And you wouldn't be for two reasons. Number one is that if it had gone up and doubled, you would have sold it.
(12:29) Number two, if you actually had done that, then you would have made another hundred other stupid decisions. And you have to factor in those decisions, too. And so that decision-making calculus would be one of incredibly high risk. And so, it's very likely that you wouldn't have made money at all because it wouldn't have been $1,000.
(12:48) You would have put $10 into Bitcoin because the other 990 you would have put into other 999 other stupid things. And I'm not saying Bitcoin's stupid. That's not my point. The point is just that that that would have been a high-risisk decision at that time. What do you do with your $1,000? You buy skills. Now, I say that and people are like, "Well, how do I buy a skill?" Well, one is you can get paid to earn a skill when you get a job and you actually ask them, "Hey, I would like to learn these things." One, will you pay for it? Two, will you let me learn it from somebody else who already works
(13:11) here? And guess what? Most employers say yes. You know why? Cuz no one does that because everyone's lazy. Everyone's afraid. Everyone they I can't ask them if I if they'll pay for me to to learn something. Why not? It like think about this for me.
(13:29) If you make $60,000 a year and you're like, "Hey, can I learn this other skill?" And I would say, "Okay, once you learn this other skill, let's say you want to go to a conference for two days that speak, you know, teach a specific thing on, you know, Tik Tok shop, whatever, right?" Like, "Okay, well, what are you going to how you going to use that when you get back?" Well, I think that if I take that, I could probably sell the books on Tik Tok shop. I'd be like, "Okay, I can see why that would make us more than $5,000. Great deal. Go for it.
(13:45) " Now, what do I do? I'm happy to shell out the five grand because it'll make me more back and you're happy to learn it because it makes you more valuable overall. Why would you not do that? Alternatively, you say, "Hey, Neil, you're really good at M&A, you know, at acquisition.com. Do you mind if we have lunch? You're going to eat either way. I would love to eat with you.
(14:02) And if you want, I'm happy to tell you about the stuff that I'm good at on the media side." And maybe Neil says no. But you know what? You can ask 20 other people. That's free learning in terms of skills of like, you know what, my job for sucks. Everyone is stupid. My boss is an ass. Whatever. Then what do you do with your thousand bucks now? So I just gave you free skills, paid skills. I just love this example. I've used it before, but it's so good.
(14:21) Friend of mine's daughter making minimum wage, wants to save money. He says, "Hey, why don't you just triple your minimum wage?" She says, "How?" He says, "Why don't you just go get a phabotamus certification? It takes a weekend and it's $500 and then you pass the test and then after that eight weeks or whatever it is, right? You can then make three times your earning power.
(14:46) That's going to save that's going to that's going to pay more dividends than any S&P, any Bitcoin, any meme, anything. Because the thing is, even if you do hit it big, what do you do when you have $100,000 after that? You're stuck. But the thing is is that you become the money faucet when you stack your skills. And so you can start at the lowest tier, which is like, will anyone I know teach me stuff? Above that, you've got YouTube videos where you can teach yourself, right? And there's lots of experts who are very good at teaching things on the internet that will help. Above that, you're like,
(15:10) "Okay, well, I have a job. Maybe I'll learn from somebody who works here, and I know that these skills are valuable because my boss pays them more than they pay me, and I would love to learn it." On top of that, you ask your boss, "Hey, can I go somewhere where I will find out a skill that will make you more money?" And guess what? I know that skill is valuable because he'll pay more for it.
(15:27) If none of those other things, and if you're like, "Wow, those are four very legitimate paths to learning." Duh. On top of that, then finally, you say, "You know what? no one I know in my business outside of my life and I can't find it on the internet or I would need more personalized attention. Then you take that and you get a tutor. That's it. You go to a certification, you get a tutor, you get a teacher, you learn.
(15:44) Like that's how I learned Facebook ads. I just paid someone early. I said, "Teach me." And then I made way more back. And the thing is is that real world skills like running ads, building landing pages, learning how to write copy, learning how to sell, these are all skills that are super valuable in the marketplace and available for free online.
(16:03) So if you're like, I'm making minimum wage. I'm making $40,000 a year. I don't know how to escape. It's like, dude, pick one and stick with it. That's it. And then ask people if they need it. And so if you did spend that money to draw blood, right, you earn way more from a tiny investment. That's why you don't save. Spend more on the earning. And I'll tell you, I'll tell you a little secret.
(16:24) I spent 100% of my money every single month until I could not spend the money because I was making too much of it on learning more stuff. Real. So we're talking 20, 30, 40, 50. I just kept plowing it in because I kept getting a better return on that than anything I could put it into. I'll I'll give you this little rule of thumb.
(16:42) The day you stop investing in education for yourself in skills is the day that you decide you're good enough and you don't want to grow anymore. So if you're not investing in anything now, then you've already decided that you don't want to get better than you are.
(16:56) And so my favorite way of saying this is that instead of investing in the S&P 500, invest in the SME 500 because that $,000 triples your income versus turning from $1,000 to $1,100 a year later. Whoop-dedoo. Now once you start earning these skills, what else do our rich parents say? Reputation over everything. Trust is earned in drops but lost in buckets. Never trade reputation for money. You can only get one of them back. Poor parents focus on this month's bills.
(17:22) Rich parents focus on this decade's wealth-b buildinging skills. Every deal I've done with someone who says they value relationships and morals above everything else has done the opposite. So, I prefer dealing with people that just say they want to make money, and ironically, it tends to keep everyone honest. And so your reputation is your most valuable asset.
(17:40) And I'm willing to leave money on the table on this deal. So there are future deals. And so the moment you prioritize short-term cash over long-term investments, you've already lost. So what you're what you're you're missing is the value of a story. So let me explain. I was studying Rockefeller and he was telling a story to his son about how he made his first really big acquisition. So Rockefeller was the second biggest oil producer in a city in Ohio.
(18:07) I think it was Cincinnati, doesn't matter. He was number two. The number one guy was significantly bigger than him. And so he approached the number one guy and said, "Hey, I want to buy you out." The guy scoffed at him, laughed him off, and then he came back. He said, "No, I'm serious." And he was like, "All right, fine. Let's talk." And so the guy said, "I'm not going to sell unless you're going to give me an absurd amount of money.
(18:26) " And so then Rockefeller lined up the financing and gave the guy an absurd amount of money. In other words, he overpaid for the guy's business. And so after the deal was done, the other guy who was, you know, once the bigger guy, uh, was like, "Man, you overpaid for that thing. Like, it wasn't even worth close to that.
(18:42) " And the crazy part is is that when Rockefeller tells the story, he said he was right. I overpaid for it. But what he failed to consider was that in the next 60 days, Rockefeller could say he was the number one biggest oil producer in Ohio. And as soon as that happened, he did 22 M&A deals in the next 60 days rolling up everyone around him because he became the biggest player.
(19:05) And so that story, the delta between the value of what that company was actually worth versus what he was willing to pay, that value was what John Rockefeller valued the story at. He might have even valued it higher than that. And his return on that delta created the next 22 deals he was able to do. And I think we can all agree that it seemed to work out pretty well for him.
(19:25) And so people underestimate the value arbitrage that exists in a story. And stories also go both ways. And so if there's a story that's equal opposite of that where you're like, hey, if I do this, I'll give you an example. I personally have zero issues ethically with, you know, girls who do only fans or whatever else.
(19:42) And and I'll, you know, I'll I'll take the second to say like I believe that people have their own choice and as long as they're not hurting other people, they should be permitted to do it. Is it is it the career path that I would necessarily choose? No, I wouldn't. I would try that. I would just try and find something else, right? But do I have any issues with that? No, I don't. Now, of course, some people who listen to my stuff will be like, "Oh, that's terrible." And then amazing.
(20:00) I love that you have your own values. That's great. You don't need to attack mine. Point is, I've had multiple deals that have come to me that have been not even necessarily in that space, adjacent to it, right? And honestly, met the people, amazing people, sometimes great business people, and I was like, I can't do the deal. I'm really sorry.
(20:19) And they're like, "But I thought that you are very like, hey, you know, you're just like very, you know, everything everything is what it is. We all die, whatever." And I was like, "I am." I was like, "The thing is is that me even having to give the disclaimers I did is because not everyone that I do business with is." And so that reputation would follow me.
(20:36) And so it's just I'm not willing to make the trade. Reputation goes both ways. And the thing is is most reputational stuff is very irreversible. It's a one-way door. And so I would rather maximize as many one-way doors that are permanent and good than permanent and bad. So that leads to Rockefeller bought this story.
(20:54) He bought this element of reputation he was able to leverage. What else do rich people buy? They buy time. And time is a very amorphous thing, right? Because it really means like I buy excess capacity so that I can reallocate that capacity to something that is going to get me a higher return than this inanimate object. And so I'll tell you a little a micro story of this.
(21:11) How do you make this tactical? So, when I was single and in my early 20s, I ate at Chipotle over 500 times in one year. I didn't know that. I found out from my accountant who was like, "Why do I have 500 transactions at Chipotle?" I was like, "Well," he's like, "You really got to cut down on this bill." I was like, "Why?" He's like, "You're spending so much money there." I was like, "Well, I don't buy groceries." I was like, "I don't prep food.
(21:29) I don't do any of that." And that amount of time that saves me. I was like, "I can do sales all day." And one sale is 500 bucks and that takes 30 minutes. And so, I'm happy to just do that. Everybody trades time for money.
(21:50) Everyone does whether they like it or not because and I'll prove it because we live in time and we get money over that same period of time. So all money you earn is rel is related to some time that you spent getting it, deciding it, doing a deal, whatever. There was some time. Now it might have not been denoted in a time of you get this per hour, but you could say it spent took 100 hours to make this deal and then I made the deal and I made $10 million.
(22:08) It's like okay well you took $10 million divided by 100 and that's how much you made. You made $100,000 an hour. Great. And so if there's something else that's worth more than $100,000 an hour, you should do that instead, right? And so getting out of this mythology and just looking at like it's it's and getting out of this black and white thinking and just thinking, okay, what are the facts? What are the observables? Right? And so let me give you the single best trade that you only get to make once in your life. It cost $1,500 a month.
(22:29) I'm going to break it down for you. Like if you if you replay any part of this video, this will be it. The best ROI you'll ever get for $1,500 a month is that you use that $1,500 to eliminate all time consuming human tasks and gain back all the productive hours. So, let me tell you what it adds up to.
(22:48) So, let's say that food cost you 50 hours per month, which is a lot. Food costs a lot of time. To get that food completely taken care of for you is about 800 bucks. Okay, what else we got? We've got cleaning the house. We've got cleaning clothes. Now, both of these, you've got cleaning the house is somewhere probably around 25ish hours per month. You've got cleaning and folding clothes, which is about 16.
(23:11) And if you're like, where are these numbers coming from? This is from Z research on the internet. You can look it up on your own. Doesn't really matter though. You're going to get the point in a second. So, that you can replace for about $500 a month. You can replace this for probably about $200 a month.
(23:28) And so, what does all this add up to? Well, if you add all this stuff together, you're going to save 96 hours per month. for a cost of $1,500. So, rough math here. If you know how to make more than $15 per hour, this trade makes sense. Now, I'm going to do you one better. Even if you don't make $15 an hour, if you take the 96 hours every month to try and learn how to make more than 15 $15 an hour, you can learn that in a month. And here's the here's the here's the good news and the bad news. The good news is that this 100% works.
(24:00) The crazy part is that I talk to entrepreneurs who are making a million dollars a year and they don't even do this sometimes because they feel guilty about it. But they just again they believe they buy into the mythology, right? And if you can't explain your beliefs, then they're not your beliefs, they're someone else's, right? And so you just heard this thing and someone got poo pooed in front of you when you were a kid for for feeling fancy by having a maid. And you say, "Oh, I'm never going to have a maid uh when I grow up." But it's dumb. It's
(24:22) a bad trade. It's like you think about your business in one way, your cost and expenses and your income. And then when you think about your personal life, you're like, "Oh, I'll mow my own lawn." It's like, why? Why? And so you can only, and I told you there's two things, good news, bad news. The bad news is that you can only make this trade once because you can't recoup.
(24:38) Like, if I could keep spending $1,500 and getting 96 hours back, my god, that would be amazing, right? But it doesn't work that way.
(24:49) You can only do that trade once, right? And that's because there's plenty of businesses that are set up and there's plenty of other people who have fewer skills who are willing to do it for less. So, if something doesn't buy you time, strongly consider not buying it. Stop buying so much stuff because at the end of the day, do you want to look rich or do you want to be rich? Here's a little plus one, a 2011 advanced wealth for you.
(25:06) Rich people aren't impressed by stuff, by your Lambo, your Rolex, right? They're impressed by how rich you'll be in 20 years. Like, if I see a younger guy who's flashing a watch, I just think how silly. Like, you could have taken that and then like, you could have taken that in 20 years from now that would have been something significantly bigger, maybe a building or a business. I remember the very first event that I ran for Gym Launch.
(25:25) And this is when I was I was a cash millionaire at this point. I pulled up and it was in Leila's car. So, it was a it was a Prius, so we shared a car. A Prius with a cracked a cracked windshield uh and a dent in the side door. I pull up and all these people all these gym owners are there because I'm I'm supposed to help them make more money, right? And I remember and you think that like, oh no, they're going to think or they're going to say something. Oh, no. They said something. So, I remember this this this particular
(25:47) gym owner was walking and there's a group of them and they see me. Some of them keep going. One of them stops and then just belines over to where I am taking my stuff out of my car and she says, "I thought you were supposed to be rich." It's what she said. "I thought you were supposed to be rich.
(26:04) " I remember and I, you know, kudos to to younger me at the time. I said I said, "Don't judge my car." I said, "Judge my bank account." And that worked. She was like, "Oh, okay. Good way to think about." And then we walked in. It was all good. Right. But I remember that story because people do judge a book by its cover, but she was not very rich and so she was judging me in that way.
(26:24) And so don't get poor people rich, right? Because poor people rich will keep you poor. So like look at the Zucks and the Basoses, right? Like they dress like regular people. Now to be fair, they they try and brag in other ways with their $300 million yachts, but you know, relative to 100 billion, it's literally less than I mean it's less than 1% of their income, which is absurd, right? I mean, I remember for me, I spent 16 months trying to figure out my Darwin outfit, right? Five pieces that work for the gym, restaurant, work, or the pool,
(26:48) right? And sometimes I have to negotiate my window to restaurants that Leila wants to eat at because of the dress code. But at the end of the day, for me, I can travel for weeks with a small backpack, get my entire wardrobe in my bedside table. And so, for me, that's more valuable. Now, I want to be clear, there are some people who like, you know, nice suits and stuff, and there's nothing wrong with that. And maybe in some season of my life, I'll do that.
(27:06) But I think the key is that you're doing it for you, and not for anyone else. You want to buy time, not stuff. So it continues to compound. So what's going to help you compound faster? Eight. So what makes you compound all this even faster? Avoid bad environments.
(27:24) Now what's a bad environment? I would say a bad environment is any environment that decreases the likely to achieve your goals. So this research has been cited all over the place, which is one of the the longest longitudinal study studies on success is that there's a high correlation between your success and your reference group, aka the five people that you compare yourself to. And so when you get when you cut bad friends, it's not that you're being antisocial.
(27:42) It's that you're raising your standards. Right? If you want to change your actions, the easiest thing to do is change your environment. Right? Average parents teach kids to get along with everyone. Right? Wealthy parents teach kids to ruthlessly create their circle. I mean, I'll be real.
(27:58) Like there are some parents, and this isn't me poo pooing parents, but that basically let their kids hang out with anyone. I mean, I could tell you that was not that did not fly in, you know, in my household. anybody who was going to hang out with me when I was a kid. I'm not saying and obviously now, but like I didn't know that my parents were helping me in that way when I was younger, is that they made sure that the people that I was friends with were cool.
(28:15) And by cool, I mean like going somewhere like not not scrubs, right? If you're ambitious and young and you have friends who are less ambitious than you, don't be friends with them. And then find people who are more ambitious than you and don't let them be more ambitious than you. Because if if your friends don't have goals, your goal should be to get new friends.
(28:33) My fastest one strike policy is if I feel like you're anything but stoked when I win, I don't need you. Like I already have enough people rooting against me, right? It shouldn't at the very least my friends should root for me, right? And so friends root for you to win and to make you better. Enemies tell you to put your goals on hold and secretly hope for you to lose.
(28:50) Think about how wild this is. Let's say that the people who in your life like do they increase or decrease the likelihood you achieve your goals? Now don't think about intention. Don't think about their reasoning. Just accur ask yourself this is a little bit of objectivism and this is how I see the world which also makes it it's far more powerful for pred predicting what's going to happen.
(29:09) Does this person increase or decrease the likely to hit my goal if these answers decrease? When you have two or three or four of those, you've got three or four people that are decreasing likely to hit your goal. That adds up. Now, on the flip side, if you had multiple people that increase the likely to hit your goals, what do you think happens? You rise up.
(29:25) And so, if someone calls themselves a friend but acts like an enemy, treat them like one. The most dangerous enemies are the ones who call themselves your friends. And if you define enemies as people who decrease like likelihood to hit your goals, a lot of the people you think are your friends your enemies. And on the other side, there may be people who actually are your enemies who might be your friends.
(29:41) If you're competitive with someone and all they do is drive you to do better because they're your friendmy. They serve real value. Maybe you are better friends with them. Kind of interesting. So when someone tells me they have a lot of friends, all I think is they just have low standards.
(30:00) So the question is why does having a reference group full of ambitious and successful people help you, right? I'll give you Alex's theory. So motivation is the equal opposite of deprivation. So let let's say this is the goal and this is you. Okay? The greater the gap is between these things, the greater the motivation.
(30:19) So if I just ate lunch, I am not that motivated to eat because I'm not deprived of food. If I don't eat for 3 days, I'll be incredibly motivated to eat because I am deprived of food. If you haven't slept in two days, you're very deprived of sleep and therefore very motivated to sleep.
(30:37) Right? Now, how does that work with successful behaviors? Well, if you let's say money, because it's a simple one, right? Let's say you want to make more money. If you are the wealthiest person of the people you compare yourself to, your motivation to make more money will be significantly lower. Now, to be clear, I'm not saying that's a bad thing. I'm just saying it will be.
(30:55) If the people you compare yourself to, even if you're around poor people, make a lot more money than you, then your deprivation will be significantly higher. And you would think though, wait, shouldn't I shouldn't the logic be that all poor people should be more motivated to make money? No, it's about who they compare themselves to. And if you are the richest of your poor friends, you might feel like a baller. And again, nothing wrong with that. But I only talk about increasing likelihoods.
(31:13) So I'll give you a real world example of this. So who do you think makes more money? And I'll tie it in. Married guys or single guys? So, ironically, people are like, "I don't want that expense. I don't have a wife and kids." Well, married guys make more money on average. Kind of interesting. And married men with kids make more than just married guys.
(31:32) The thing is this, why would that be a thing? They make more money because they need more money, right? They have more deprivation for money when they have four kids than they have no kids, right? And when you have a wife and four kids, you got to make more money. That drive is what drives them to make more.
(31:44) Now, again, if they then also, that's an element. If they also compared themselves to people who made significantly more, they might make even more than that. And so it's not like, oh wait, does this are these contradictory? It's like, no, they're additive, right? And so the problem is that most poor people know a lot of other poor people. And so they're not that poor relative to the people they know.
(32:04) So the deprivation to their reference group is basically nil. It's zero. And so they're and so too is their motivation. And so most people are so busy looking for outside investments, they completely miss the most obvious opportunity staring them in the face, which is understanding what actually makes them money.
(32:22) So number nine, so middle class families teach their kids that their home and car are assets. Rich families will teach their kids that assets are only things that put money back into your pocket. Now, the only money rules that matter to me are number one, make this A, spend less than you earn. I say this as duh, and yet so few people will do it. B, buy stuff that goes like this in value.
(32:41) If you spend less than you earn, you'll have some leftover. With the leftover, you buy stuff that will be worth more tomorrow. But that stuff that be worth more tomorrow might be a skill. And the thing is because the skill, like if you thought of a skill as an extra $1,000 a month, then wouldn't like what investments can you pay $500 for one time that make you an extra $1,000 a month for the rest of your life? That would be an insane investment. And that's what skills are.
(33:07) And here's what's even crazier. They're not taxable. You also can't lose them in a divorce. No government can take it from you. And it might be because my my family fled from Iran during the revolution. And so we lost everything. The only thing we had was education. But that's why I'm so hard on this stuff.
(33:25) And then eventually when this stuff makes you more than you need to live, you're good. Happy face. Everything else is just bonus. And so it sounds obvious, but like the thing is is that simple things can be simple to understand, but difficult to execute. because that's where the heart is with this stuff. It's it's not in the understanding, it's in the doing. Actually wrote this.
(33:42) People fail not because there's some magical list nobody has. They fail because it's an obvious list nobody does. Number 10 is rich parents have a higher minimum standard. So what does that mean? So there's a couple ways to think about this. So number one is that rich parents will talk in different orders of magnitude in different increments.
(34:00) This is the classic example of like Warren Buffett uh when asked you to do a mic check was like 1 million 2 million 3 million and it's just like and I I know it was it's joke at the time but I just I thought about that because like when I was a younger kid I used to count my money in how many Chipotle burritos I could buy and then as I got older it turned into a larger increment which for me was actually the number of customers I had to sell in order to make something.
(34:24) And then over time basically it's just number of number of units of something that I've had to sell in order to get whatever I want. It's just the unit of thing has just stayed stagnant and the cost of those things have gone up. Rich parents simply won't allow their kids to go below or accept opportunities that are minimum below the minimum.
(34:40) So I'll give you a different example. So there's a guy that I know who grew up rich. All right, super rich. New York rich. He has somehow been able to make, call it, $400, $500,000 a year for the vast majority of his adult life with basically no skills. Like he does nothing. Like I'm very confident like he actually does nothing.
(35:07) And what's interesting though is that like he's had to go from thing to thing because eventually people figure that out. But he will stand there in a negotiation and they're like, "Hey, you know, we'll we'll pay you 385,000." and he's like, "I'm not working here for less than 450." And the crazy thing is is because he just genu like like delusionally just like he would rather be broke than be someone who makes less than that.
(35:30) And so like I think that is kind of the declarative knowledge, those standards that are passed down. Like that is probably some of the biggest gift. It's like of course you're not going to do that. It's not worth your time. And so they they simply wait for better opportunities. That's really it. Like they just won't say yes to something that's not as good. and they'll just wait. And so like think about it. Think about it in a guys and girls scenario.
(35:49) Like there are tons of poor guys who have like hot girls and there's tons of ugly dudes who have hot girls who aren't rich. All right? There are they exist. Believe they exist. What separates them from the other guy who's equally badl looking who doesn't have the hot girl. The other guy just went on more dates or waited longer.
(36:07) He just kissed more toads. Whatever you want to say, right? Eventually there's going to be some crazy uh hot enough girl that's just like, "You know what? he's my kind of ugly and it works. And that's the thing that I think a lot of poor parents don't transfer their kids is like there's a significantly higher amount of volume and because they know it's possible and rich kids aren't smarter than poor kids. They might be more educated but not smarter.
(36:32) And so if them why not you and so another big difference between these so this is number 11. I forgot to write down number 10 but let we'll just we'll say number 10 min standards. Actually I'm going to add one more thing to that. So one more on on minimum standards is that the measuring stick they use to measure is is bigger right they're measuring increments like listen to the examples that people are talking about that they claim are a lot around you so if the people if you meet somebody and they're like it was like $1,000 right like that $1,000 might that's like them
(37:03) demonstrating that this is an increment that is meaningful to me you want to hang around somebody who's like you always want to hang out with the person who has the the largest increment that they measure things with the largest measuring stick. And I'll give you a finance example from hedge funds in New York.
(37:17) They have a slaying term for a million dollars, which is a stick. And so it's like two sticks, four sticks, because it's such a common increment of money. Hard to fathom when you didn't grow up around that. So number 11, there's four types of money, or rather four sources that you can pull that you can use for leverage.
(37:35) All right? And this is super important. you get poor a lot of times based on the type of money you use. So on the kind of like on little A over here is you can use debt, right? You can use consumer debt, you can use a credit card, Lone Shark, whatever to buy stuff. You don't want to do that because not only does it cost you today, it cost you more tomorrow.
(37:55) The next is that you can use your savings. So this is your little nest egg, right? That's another place that you can finance whatever purchases you want out of. The third little bucket that we have is you can learn it out of your cash flow. So, you make you make a check, you get paid on Friday, you take some of that check before it goes into savings and you spend it. Okay, simple enough.
(38:12) And then the last is what I like to call new opportunities. And the easiest way to explain this is I had a construction kitchen remodeler who came out here. They were probably doing like 5ish million a year, something like that. And she wanted us to look at the business and have my team kind of like do a full analysis and be like, "All right, this we need to change the market.
(38:32) This we need to change sales, whatever, right?" And so, it's not cheap. and she took on a project for an extra 150 grand uh that was like a personal design project that she doesn't normally take on so that she could buy it and pay for it. And I remember thinking to myself like she's going to make it like she'll be fine because she already thinks about money the right way. And this is a common trait I've seen among wealthy people.
(38:57) And if you're not wealthy yet and you can adopt this mentality, then it increases the likelihood that you will make more later. Which by the way, I just mentioned that lady who came out. If you are a business owner and you're making, you know, you've got a legitimate business, you've got employees, revenue, profit, etc.
(39:17) , and you'd like to see how we grow companies. Uh, every month at acquisition.com in person at my headquarters, we hold basically two-day workshops where my team, my actual, you know, director of marketing, director of sales, director of media, all of all of my team basically works with businesses to just help them grow.
(39:36) And it's a cool way for us to meet new companies that kind of builds our pipeline on the investment side, but it also just provides value to you guys. And so, it's kind of a cool win-win. You know, the reviews are exceptional. So the link is ACQ ACQ the letters.com vegas. You can go there and you grab a time with my team.
(39:54) They'll just ask you a couple questions, make sure the business makes sense that we can help you out. And if so, then we'll invite chat here to Vegas and have a have a party. Not really. It'll just be almost all entirely business. And I would encourage you not to party or at least till afterwards. Uh but beyond that, let's get back to it. So in reverse here, if you pay out of this, you're taking from the present.
(40:10) Here you're taking from your past self. Here you're taking from your future self. here is the only place where you can take all of your existing flows. They can continue to get allocated to your investment goals, your savings goals, whatever it is, but then this money allows you to take advantage of a new opportunity. So, you're like, okay, I want to do this thing.
(40:29) It wasn't in my plan, and so therefore, I'm going to do something that also wasn't in my plan to get it. That's the magic. And I love this because this is how this how I'm biased here. This is how I think about money. There's a great story of Paul McCartney who was like he he was with was it Yokoono or whatever and he wanted a swimming pool and she was like no where she whatever for whatever reason he couldn't get it and so he said fine he said I'll just go write a song and so she said you're going to write yourself a swimming pool and he said yeah and so write yourself your own swimming pool is
(41:01) he needed to go write a song he knew if he wrote the song he'd make the money for the swimming pool he could have it so of course he could afford it he was a beetle he was crushing it but it's the concept and the thing is is that's the thing is it's like even when you have the money it's like well I've already allocated all this money and this is something that did I didn't expect so it's totally okay to also do work you didn't expect to get it all right number 12 and this one you're not going to this
(41:24) one will probably surprise you so this is this is sass spending is a skill the only people who say you can't buy happiness haven't given enough away and the reason is is that spending money using money is a skill and so it makes sense that as you increase your income and I think the the numbers have been updated. It used to be $70,000.
(41:44) Now it's closer to like you know $400 or $500,000 is the is the cap on happiness. But that's usually because at $400 or $500,000 that is what most people can fathom with their existing understanding of the world for ways to use money. And rather than saying spending money, using money and so you want to use money because it's a tool like a pro. And people don't even think about it like that.
(42:07) Of course, you can like, of course, there's investments, but how can you spend effectively, right? This is where you're constantly buying time, not stuff. And the thing is, there are levels to buying. This is, call it my 101. This is my this is my you get up to, you know, a couple hundred,000 a year, this this level of spending. But most people stop there.
(42:32) You can keep going on this game, right? You can get a house manager. You can have executive assistants. You can have multiple executive assistants. You can have drivers. You can have security that also help and do things for you. You can retire your parents. You can control your calendar even more aggressively. Like you could fly private.
(42:50) You like there are plenty of other things that you can spend money on to amilarate little vocab word for you improve your life. And so I remember I'll tell you the story. So Leila and I when we were, you know, coming up, I think at this point we were probably make it doesn't matter. We're making a lot of money. I'll just leave it with her.
(43:10) And we met with a friend of ours who's significantly older and you know, she's like, "Why do you always look like crap?" And she was being a little bit mean, but she was saying that to to Ila because she was like, "You're always just dressed in gym clothes." Right? Now, both of us came from fitness, so like we just that's all we owned was fitness clothes, right? And she said, "Why don't you buy nice stuff?" And Ila was like, "I just, you know, I just feel weird spending that much money on clothes." She's like, "You have so much money. What are you talking about?" And
(43:32) so she said, "I'm going to take you shopping." She said, she said, "You suck at being rich." That was actually what she said. And so she took Ila shopping. And so I remember Ila told me the story. She she she walked in to the store and she's like, "Okay." She's like, "Meet me at the in the at like Neiman Marcus or Chanel or something, whatever.
(43:50) " And so she gets into Chanel. And then she was like, "Come to the back." And they're like she was like, "Okay." Okay. So, she goes to the back and they had an entire room all along the whole sides of all the room. They had already prepicked all the clothes to be only Leila's size. And they had like champagne. And she was sitting there.
(44:08) Her friend was like, "All right, you're not leaving here without spending at least $30,000." And so Ila sp and like Ila's like stomach dropped. She's like, "Oh my god." And so she spent $3 like $6,000 on clothing. Now, of course, my stomach dropped cuz I was like, "What happened?" But but anyways, she spent the money and the point was is is that this friend of ours had been rich for a very long time and she was like, "You said you wanted these things." So she's like, "So get them.
(44:31) " You know, it's just like And again, you might be like, "Wait a second. I thought this is this is antithetical to that." Leila likes that stuff. She would wear she wears it. She She likes this stuff. I obviously don't. And I think that that's like if you if you take anything from this, it's doing you right.
(44:50) I think the you acquire this money to do what? You're going to die with it and then leave it to somebody else who's going to blow it. So, who cares, right? I talk about this from the perspective of how do I optimize to get this outcome? Once you get the outcome, you can do whatever you want.
(45:03) But if you only optimize around money, you optimize around accumulation of a tool. So, you might as well also have the skill to use

(00:00) why your business isn't growing and so we have our inputs we have efficiencies and we have an output and so this output most of the time for a business is money right the issue that I continue to see is that people aren't clear on what the inputs are and so taken to this extreme I could say okay if no one knows that your gym exists will you make money no so we have to get people to know that you exist all right step one people have to know you exist and so right now part of some of your problems is that not enough people know that you exist and so what do we do to increase how many
(00:41) people know that we exist we get traffic or we advertise now if advertising is the thing that we're going to do to get more people to know about our stuff what is the primary method of advertising that you have right now now for those guys who who hear red leads by the way the book oh neat thank you appreciate it um so you can reach out to people that you know or don't know you can make content you can run ads or realistically you can get an affiliate partner who does those things for you but for everyone here so we can make this interactive who here only uses ads
(01:20) to get customers or primarily uses ads to get customers okay so that looks like about a quarter quarter to a third okay who here uses Outreach to get customers primarily oh less okay like 10% okay who uses making content to get customers interesting that was higher than I expected who here has referral Partners who refer you business on a regular basis and that's the primary way you get customers okay not a ton okay so the reason this is so important is that if your business is struggling or you're you're struggling to grow your business
(01:58) then it means that if the first step in the ch for you making money is that people find out about the stuff a lot of you guys aren't letting people know and you haven't boiled it down to the inputs so I'm going to come back to this page if we have content as your primary way of getting customers if we have paid ads if we have Outreach and if we have referrals or referral partners then we have to book R this down to the activities that we need to do in order to do more of it right so you're like okay I make content so then the question is how much are you making and how good is it now I personally
(02:40) believe that for local businesses the purpose of content is not to get customers it is to convert a higher percentage of customers because most of the algorithms on these platform are Global and so if you make content and you're in Idaho and the vast majority of people who see your content are not in Idaho or not even in a f mile radius who cares unless you want to go on the online thing which is a totally different game and so I see the purpose of making content as a local business owner as something that when you do reach out or if someone does get referred to you or you do run an ad
(03:12) people click over to your page and they see if you're legit or if you look friendly you look nice they look at the equipment they look at the facility say oh this place looks cool oh it's right by where I live or it's right on my way to work and then they make a decision to move forward so if you're currently making zero content super Light Lift make some like one a week so you just look like you have a heartbeat online really high Roi for like one piece a week Beyond going above that then you get into the I want to make content as my primary marketing mechanism and now you're
(03:44) driving volume and quality through that so this then if content is your primary way which I'm still amazed by for those of you uh who that's what you do is that you want to start thinking how do I make and for context we make about 400 pieces of content a week we posted it's a lot and so you're like wait a sec you're like doing the math you're like that's 55 pieces a day it's a lot it's more than two an hour so a lot and so that is a baseline let's start with like two a day something that you can do and the
(04:18) reason I want to boil this down this way is that if you're like I can't grow my gym I can't grow my business and the thing that grows my business is that I make content then do a shitload more of that I know crazy it's what I'm known for the very deep insights all right so so paid ads which was I think the largest percentage of you here still a minority which half frightens me for you but we'll keep going paid ads the thing that you do when you run paid ads is that you're spending money every day so the actual platform does
(04:58) the distribution of the content for you does the distribution of the offer for you so that you can generate leads but the work of making paid ads that you do every day is in the creative it's in scripting out the ads thinking through the hooks doing research on other ads that are working in the weight loss space and thinking okay how can I emulate that part of that might be I have to learn how to use one of those phone editing softwares yeah that's that's the job that's work that's how it works and so
(05:26) for each of these activities I'll give you my rule of thumb which is that it's 4 hours a day and some of you are going to be like gulp 4 hours a day yeah you're trying to grow right like I I I don't we'll get to this in the second half of this this talk but if this is the input into the system that makes everything go Burr then this is the thing that makes you money and everything that you're doing that's not this is not making you as much money as doing more of this and for most small businesses if you're under $100,000 a month you just need to let people know that you exist and some of you guys are concerned about
(06:09) your Brands and things like that the brand is 100% going to be delivered based on the quality of the product quality of the service that you give so let going give you a quick little little hack here and then we'll come back to this so brand can only be built in three ways one is what you say the second is what other people say and the third is what people experience themselves and so what ends up happening is in the beginning you have no customers in the beginning it was dark right so you say stuff you say hey my
(06:48) stuff's awesome look it's clean it's stuff it's it's in the neighborhood that you like it's safe whatever you won't get hurt here you'll look nice and skinny you want to be skinny look at me I'm skinny too you could be like me so you say these things great then somebody will buy and then if they have good things to say they leave you reviews and then the person who's considering buying is like okay well I like what they were saying and other people seem to be saying nice stuff so then maybe I will buy but then as soon as they do buy they actually have an experience personally so here these two things are
(07:23) approximations these two things are advertising this is product because somebody can come out with the coolest most premium sweetest looking brand in the world but if you buy the shirt and it has holes in it not the holes that are cool just holes it's going to suck and you be like these guys are full of it if you go to if you wait in line forever for this Swanky new restaurant because they say they were really cool and expensive and other people say they were really cool and expensive and then you go there and
(07:53) you're like this is not cool and just expensive you're like I hate this place and so immediately there's a promise that you're making here and then you deliver it here and if you deliver based on the promise you make that reinforces the brand and then these people become these people and they say nice [ __ ] and that is how you build a brand in a local business that's it it's all about the delivery and the reality is the vast majority I'll say the average person here is mediocre was waiting for that to hit but maybe it didn't anyways half of you are below average I
(08:29) know um but the real real is like everybody here most people would say no our gym like the amount of times that I heard my Gym's amazing if people just came in to experience it I'd be like do you have customers and they're like yeah I'm like and they're not getting any more customers it's not amazing you're not that good Comm and that's okay but the problem is when you think you are good and then don't put any attention to it because you delude yourself into thinking that you're so good that no one talks about your [ __ ] I'm so good people just want to keep me
(09:01) a secret sure it's like I love you so much baby I just can't bring you in public okay so back to advertising all right so you're making two pieces of content today if that's what you're doing if you're doing runand paid ads you want to commit to a certain dollar amount per day and I can't impress this upon you enough is that like you spend this money before you eat like this is how your business eats this is not this is not feeding your child if you don't spend this money because this is how you distribute your
(09:37) message this how people find out about your stuff this is the input into the system that goes burn and makes money so you spend the money and then your four hours for this is about how to make ads and that's the skill if you do that every day guess what you'll get way better at making ads and so I'll give you a little hack that I do one whenever I see an ad of any kind so one I'm not premium on anything I want to see the ads if I like an ad I save it I screenshot it and I have an album that's all the ads that I like then when I go to start making ads
(10:16) which if it's you you're going to be doing this every day I go back I review my all-time greatest ads and I like to drink them in so I'm like okay these are the words that I were saying these are the hooks these are the settings that I was using okay these are the pain points I brought up and then I look at the new ads that I've seen that week that I thought were kind of interesting and I say okay what elements from this can I merge with the stuff that I already know to create something that's kind of new
(10:39) and so then I make a whole bunch of those and I take my winning ads and I just make them again like same words same I just do it again and then I run them and I see how they're doing and if I want to learn an effect I Google how to put this effect on a video and then we put the effect on the video and then the ad starts performing or does it and guess what you do tomorrow you do it a [ __ ] again and like I have had a lot of conversations with gym owners in my life and I'm not going to get to the second part of this talk because otherwise I'm I'm going to I'll get more offensive so
(11:22) I'm going to wait I'll I'll complete this thought process so okay please please spend money on ads please so that people can find out about your gym and if your stuff sucks then how are you going to get better besides kind of like bringing people in so that you can learn that you suck and then getting practice so that you can get better because you can spend all the time in the world trying to imagine how good your customer success you know is going to be until you have like 20 new members and you're like oh my God everything's broken I don't have any process for anything and like I suck and my trainer was late and
(11:56) wow what a terrible experience but you can't have that learning until they walk in the door so you're running paid ads if you're doing Outreach which was like 10% of you guys I'm going to say it again but the rule of 100 it just it just works it's consistent as gravity it works problem is most people don't work and so that's why they don't make money they like to think about working and they like to come up with excuses for other things that became quote urgent that never are in a gym there's basically no emergency
(12:30) I had I remember I got a call at like 4:30 in the morning when there was a water man that broke pouring over my floor and my trainer called me and he was like hey we have an emergency he said that and I immediately assumed someone's dead I was like heart attack someone's on the floor and if that's the case why are you calling me call [ __ ] 911 but he was so he said that and he's like are you ready and I was like yes just tell me he was like it's a water man I like well what are you calling me for I'm not a plumber I was like call a plumber and I could have slept a couple hours I wasn't going to change
(13:05) anything what do you want me to do what do you think you should do work out outside great idea do that why are you calling me there's no emergencies like unless you're in healthcare and you're in shock trauma there are no emergencies and so I say this to underline one point which is that many of you become distracted by things that you perceive to be emergencies but the real emergency is that you're not doing the [ __ ] you need to do to grow your business [Applause] thanks with the music there you go it's
(13:40) a real bar okay so last one's referral um and I'm going to say when I say referral here I mean a referral partner meaning you have a chiropractor you have a doctor that you helped out and they have a huge practice and they start sending you and you create some sort of relationship that you still do these things to attract this person and if you're like man if I only I've got this one guy and he sends me like half my customers well how amazing would it be if you had 10 of those guys or 20 of those guys well you know how you do that
(14:08) you ask them you reach out to them you give them gifts you bribe them really that's how it works and you know you bribe another business owner you send them business if you want someone to send you business send the business first little rule of life it works a lot better that way okay so we have our inputs and our outputs in the system right so it starts with advertising and for the vast majority of you guys you were not advertising enough that's it who here spends 4 hours a day 6 days a week advertising doing
(14:47) one of those four things does your gym make money Havey yeah it's like I don't have a gym but yes I make money it's like what are you doing here it's called gim con all right I promise you if you spend four like four hours a day is not much like four hours a day I don't know like what do you doing why your business isn't growing you're not trying to grow it all right cool well I mean we could just stop there none of you are even doing it all right well let's talk about efficiency while we're at it it doesn't matter because you're not putting anything in the system anyways but let's talk about
(15:42) it so fundamentally I'm being dead serious like it does if I were to spend a full day with each of you I'd be like oh okay well what are we going to do with the rest of our eight you know 7 hours and 40 minutes that we have for this day because that's the problem but okay let's talk about efficiency so fundamentally you got to let people know fantastic now they know you got to get them to give you money which is going to be the conversion process all right cool conversion is going to be the next step in this efficiency I'll give you I'll give you a little spoiler the next ones then you've
(16:18) got your price and then you've got your turn and I'm saying this specific to Jims because it's recurring business okay so if we think about what a business is you get more customers or you make them worth more it is the only way that you will make more money fundamentally that is it there's no other way get more customers make them worth more if we double click into each of these getting more customers means you need more traffic and better conversion and so if right now you're not getting enough customers it means you need more traffic or better conversion if you need to make your
(16:55) customers worth more the only thing you can do to make them worth more is you raise your prices you decrease churn that's what you have control over and so if you're like okay how do I make my customers worth more raise your prices get them to buy more times that's what turn decreasing turn is get them to buy for 10 months rather than five months or three months and so the idea here is that once we feed the machine this is the raw input this is eyeballs this is the activities that you do that get people to find out then it's about how many of
(17:28) these things can we turn into money and how much money can we turn it into and so the most efficient gyms are ones that convert a very high percentage at a very high price and get people to buy lots of times and so this is from a contraints perspective of figuring out what's wrong with your gym and for everybody who didn't raise their hand which is literally everyone here it's this but we'll talk about the other three is that you have steps within this conversion process you have to get them to schedule you have to get them to show and you've got a close so who here sucks
(18:05) at sales get a hand some of you suck at sales that's fine it's helpful to actually it's like the first step is being like hi my name is Sarah and I can't close a door uh so it's okay and so if you want to get better at sales if that's the problem you're getting leads in the door but you can't close then you practice closing and you do that for 4 hours a day and so there's probably a meta takeaway here which is that whatever the big problem in my business is that's what my first four hours every day are spent
(18:38) doing until I solve that problem and then I change what that four hours is spent on but that four hours that I spend in the morning before everyone gets there or if you're a late night person the last hours of the day when everyone's asleep that is what moves the business forward the vast majority of people skip those 4 hours and go straight to firefighting all day but the thing is is that if you look back on last month or 2 months or 3 months back the only thing that you really will have to show for progress is what you did in those 4 hours it's something that it took me a
(19:10) little bit of time to realize I was like oh if I don't do it in that four hours nothing big moves forward but what I can promise is that I don't remember any of the fires that I put out last month the fires are going to happen and they will get put out you'll also find that if you ignore them they tend to also go away real talk and so so and so if you're having a conversion issue from sales you practice sales the way you practice sales is you roleplay you do it with somebody else play with a friend that's how it works and you want fast
(19:41) feedback loops you need to be able to breathe the script and the secret to making sure that you don't sound dumb in the sale is you make them sound dumb in the sale and you do that by asking questions so no one can oppose you this is a little Pro tip no one can oppose you if you make no statements so whoever answers questions in the sale is the one who's losing and so you can even address this with every single obstacle that you ever come in contact with well what certifications do you guys have here which one's you looking
(20:15) for they don't know this is a question their friend told them to ask they have no idea and then they're like uh you know what are the workouts like well what's your dream workout they tell you and you're like well it's not that if I really want i' be like well how's that working for you well I don't do them okay that's why you're here cool well then want don't you do our workouts so the thing is is you there's always a way to sidestep objections by just asking what they're trying to get out of the question that they're asking you and most of the time they have no idea because you should know the answer
(20:51) of their question better than they do because you've had this conversation before imagine having the same conversation over and over again and sucking at that one conversation mindblowing it's also like not advertising your [ __ ] business anyways so you've got show rates you've got uh schedule rates and you've got close rates so that's our conversion efficiency and so whichever one of these is below Benchmark is the one that you spend your hours on I'll also promise you that schedule rate and show rate if you actually spend four
(21:25) hours a day on it will not be a problem at all but everyone just wants this to just go away magically and wants everyone just like show up ready to close like my leads suck All Leads suck until they become customers and they're amazing right but then like the process of taking a lead and making it to a customer is work and everyone's afraid of doing that and if you're looking to make your first dollar online or monetize your audience no matter what the size is school.com games is the easiest way that I know how
(21:56) to do it I take a call once a week inside of that community to answer questions for people who are getting started I have a step-by-step course that lays out what exactly to do to make your first dollar online and once a month I drop 8 hours of training from the top 10 community business owners showing exactly what they're doing to scale their communities today school.
(22:14) com SuperGames you can start for free and so now we get into LTV so you advertise more you work on these things for conversion to increase the conversion rate you have in the business and then you've got price insurance now kale I'm sure talked about pricing at some point yes okay you're probably price too low and it's not because we want to destroy your gym you're price too low because at that price you will not make a profit the amount of times that I had gym owners who were like my Gym's fool and I'm not making money and I was like
(22:51) do you see a problem like you can't service any more customers but you don't make any money get one going with this like something has to change and if you're already full we just need to increase the price you're mispriced and that's okay like that's how you learn but for many of you you just need to send an email and send a letter and let people know that from this point going forward this is the new price grab your your big boy and big girl pants and say like I'm going to take this risk because the other way is guaranteed to never
(23:23) work that's the thing is like we want to stay in the same boat and be like you know what even though all the math makes sense with this higher price I'm afraid and I'm going to let that stop me forever from getting the business to be where it needs to be that sucks so don't think that make the BET and then deliver like that actually is your price and do a really good job on the back end and the way that you do a good job which gym launch has already given you but you have exit interviews with people on the way out the door you can save half of them by saying oh you're right I didn't give you enough
(24:03) support you should go into this higher thing that's what actually gives you the support you save half your customers awesome you reach out to them every two weeks or so as though you actually cared about them that was a joke but um no one laughed at that one anyways so so you reach out to them every couple weeks and you just make sure it's a touch base it's a pulse check you don't even need to talk about fitnesses just to make sure that they know that you know that they exist you track attendance when someone says that they're actually going to show up for a time you make sure they show up and if they don't show up you say hey Marley
(24:35) where were you I missed you we actually track this and we could watch people go from three times a week three times a week two times a week one time a week cancel you can just watch it if you track attendance but if you implement that you go three times a week three times a week two times a week Marley get your ass in here three times a week three times a week and she keeps going they have to know that they're missed the next one and this is something that happened later in my life that I learned is about onboarding so when somebody
(25:06) comes in the door and you do sell them the next 24 hours are absolutely crucial to making setting all the expectations of what their experience is going to be and so right now if your onboarding process is show up on Monday tough very hard and so if there's ever a time where you invest more resources into a customer it's in that first 24 48 72 hours so that they know exactly where they're going to go at what time who's going to talk to them who reconfirms they're showing up because they're petrified because they haven't worked out in six years and they feel terrible
(25:37) and they used to be a high school weight and they can't look at the skill now because it makes them feel terrible whatever right and we have to deal with this by overc communicating in the window of time that makes the most sense and so even if it feels like it takes a little bit more effort I promise you you will get two three five more purchases from this person in terms of months by just making sure that know when they're supposed to be there who's going to be there to welcome them and who's going to show them around a little bit in the beginning so that they don't feel like they're completely
(26:07) lost okay that's churn fantastic so right now if your business is not growing as much as you want you're are not advertising enough if you're advertising enough and people are finding out about it you're getting leads they're either not scheduling not showing or not closing if it's one of those three then all of your effort in that first 4 hours of the day is to get into a schedule get a show getting to close if you're getting all of that stuff you've got lots of people and you're closing them all but you're not
(26:38) making any money you're mispriced and if you're getting all of this and you have a high price but everyone falls out the back door you have to make your stuff better and this is how you walk through it this is how you figure out what the problem in the business is and so who here has capacity in their gym right now okay start there so that is part one of my talk everyone feel good about that okay thank you so part two of The Talk is reverse engineering your goal and so the reason that I broke down the activities that you need to do into those four things is because we have to figure out how many
(27:27) custo or how many activities equals one customer so if you know that on average you post let's say 30 times a month so you post 30 times a month and from those 30 posts that you make you get five customers which for most of you is not the case because you're local businesses and this doesn't work that way but since that's what 20% of you are doing we'll talk as though that's what happens so if you make 30 posts you get five customers you can say for every six posts I get one customer okay so I need to make more
(28:11) posts and I need better posts and if you're like okay I want to get to 25 customers is my goal this is the goal then I need to 25x this so I need make 150 which means I need to do five a day okay this is something I can control is this making sense this is literally what I do with the businesses that we buy I just say I just boil everything down to like what do we do that makes us money not all the stuff after that what do we do that makes us money and they're like okay we have an outbound team I'm like okay so what are
(28:50) the outbound activities it's like well we haven't tracked it well yet well start so let's say you do 100 reach outs and that creates One customer okay and currently you're getting 10 customers currently fantastic and so that me you're doing a th000 per month which means you're doing 30 per day okay well if I want to get to 50 customers a month then I need to 5x this to get to 150 per day and then that gets me my 50 customers and what's interesting is that when you do actually increase the volume that much you also get better so you actually get leverage on
(29:35) the time because your skill improves if you do 100 shots a day for a while you get pretty good at it but when you start in the beginning and you do 10 a day you just tend to keep sucking because you never do enough to turn the corner to get enough reps in so let me ask you a different question maybe drive this home has anyone had a day where you had like or like maybe a week where you had a lot of sales you had two three four appointments a day for like a week we straight can I get a hand okay did you
(30:01) feel like you were way hotter like when you were selling you're like okay cuz you get these fast feedback peeps you're like all right I got another one and another one in an hour and then you like practice again oh and so like you're sharpening the sword on the flip side you have a dead week and you have like two sales consults it's like you got to like like d like brush the rust off right like the amount that you work the amount of volume you do will directly feed into how good you are at it and that's why the rich keep getting richer is that they do more and by doing more they get more from their more they get
(30:31) better too and so that's how skills start compounding and that's how you can just blow everyone away like the idea that any single person here gives a [ __ ] what the guy down the street is doing baffles me it just doesn't matter at all because that guy is like everyone else here and not even avertising and he's mispriced and he's breaking even even though his classes are they're people running outside looking crazy he still doesn't take any money home you know I know cuz I've looked at so many gym owner pnls no one
(31:06) makes money except for the guys who track their stuff know their inputs actually advertise work their leads price appropriately and remind customers to actually use the [Music] gym it's just that the bar for winning is not that high and so I I was going to wait to make this like the last part of the presentation but I'm gonna end up going here so whatever I I don't I don't understand why you don't do this because like everything you want is on the other side of you getting the business that works that generates a profit that keeps your customers happy that provides
(32:02) for your team like everything that you want is on the other side of that and you're like you're like on Facebook and I I I just I don't I don't get it like it I just I don't get it it's beyond me and so and this is the part that I said was similar between companies of the size so I'm going to give you hopefully the highest Roi hack that you will only be able to do at this level under 150,000 a month you'll never be able to get this again it will only happen at this stage and so when I think about conferences and workshops and things that I've attended you all have a lot of notes you
(32:42) have a lot of stuff written down that you're like I need to do all seven pages of these notes but we'll be real you'll fly back you'll put the notes somewhere or that Google doc will start moving down in the recency thing and then you'll be like oh wait what would I what was I going to do and so realistically you have like a sticky note that has like three things on it that you're actually going to do everything else really great ideas might not be what you need right now because every business only has one
(33:13) constraint and until you DEC constraint it it will stay stuck and then when you do that it will grow until its next constraint and that's how business works and so I want to make sure that the three things on that sticky note are the right three things that will make you the most most money so what if I told you that there were a way that you could get so who right now imagine your best employee who hear has employees just to make sure I've got okay thank God okay so imagine the best employee you have if you could have twice that would you make more
(33:51) money would you be willing to pay $1,500 a month this isn't going where you think it $1,500 a month to get that employee a double a clone if you will of that employee would you do it all right so the average American spends 20 I think it's 20 my numbers are going to be close 24 hours per month on food food as in going to the grocery grocery store prepping cooking cleaning up after yourself consuming the food and cleaning up after the dishes that you made all of that 24 hours a month the average American also so this is food for cleaning cleaning their
(34:45) homes spends oh you know what it might be per week I can't remember I'll just say the three letter and I don't remember the stats but for cleaning it's like 20 hours per month that people spend and then laundry is like 19 or something all of these on a monthly basis add up to 96 hours which is what I actually remember between all the time you spend on food all the time you spend cleaning all the time you spend doing laundry all the time you spend doing human stuff like things for you're human this body bag you got to walk around in right really annoying no one can do like no
(35:34) one can go to the man if I could if I could delegate like going to the bathroom and showering like dear God it'd be awesome there's a point to this you can get 96 hours a month back by paying 1,500 bucks a month to get someone to make all your food for you clean your house and do your laundry and and hold on hold on and you would do this for the most valuable person in your business who's not your employee it's you you're happy to do it for them but you don't do it for you because you don't want to waste money but you would literally do it for a teammate who's not as good as you and
(36:21) I'm making a bet here because they don't own the business and they're probably not as skilled as you are because you probably taught them half the stuff they know and you're not doing it and so I want to break this like if I can if I can get every single person here 96 hours a month it's almost it's more than two full work weeks and the difference is like I I don't get into like stop watching Netflix and television and all that stuff because that's another 100 hours but you guys like that stuff and you're not going to stop so who cares
(36:47) I'm not even get into it you are whatever but no one likes this now if you like cooking fine that's Leisure but like prepping your food preing other people's food going grocery shopping no one's like man I just love grocery Sho well some of you do you're [ __ ] weird but but but it's not worth it and so right now I'm lading up to this the 4 hours a day that no one here is spending to actually grow their company I just found it and for $1,500 a month and I said you can only do this once I can only Outsource my food one time in my career after that I don't get the gain again you're at a point where you have
(37:32) to start valuing your time and being willing to trade dollars for time like if you had to hire somebody for two grand a month you're like oh wow what a steal but I'm asking you to hire yourself for another 96 hours a month by getting rid of all this stuff on your plate that's not making you money and so when I go when I go back to this idea of the stuff that grows your business is really straightforward and so I was racking my brain I was like why don't people do this and maybe you're tired maybe you're distracted well when I had these
(38:08) meetings where I talked to these smaller you know with the business owners that are between 10 and 150,000 a month this is what they're telling me they're spending their time on and it don't stop and I promise you if you spend 96 hours a month on the constraint of your business it will grow a lot and then every you'll be here and everyone's like what what was your secret like Alex told me I should stop cooking my own food and then I started working my leads and we made more money if you can make more than $15 an hour actively working because that's what 1,500 bucks divided
(38:47) by 96 is roughly then it's worth it now if you do that and then you do nothing with the extra 96 hours then shame on you deserve to be poor so please do that it's on the sticky on the on the sticky note for the day is that maybe sticky Point number one spend four hours a day on the constraint of my business sticky note number two make sure that I actually get those four hours a day in by paying for all the things that are not that and so once you're really clear on the things that you actually have to do from an activity perspective the rest becomes eliminated
(39:29) and so right now a lot of you guys have a lot of things on your to-do list right I'm sure especially leaving here like oh my God I have all the stuff I have to do but I would encourage you to focus on your toone list like really really I I get a lot of I get a lot of credit for the speed that we moved in business and I would I would put a disproportionate amount of effort or wait on the fact that I we just try not to spend time doing stuff that doesn't matter and trying to not spend time wasting mental energy on things that I can buy to replace and so like when I
(40:12) was a single guy I get made fun of on Tik Tok now for it but like I just went to Chipotle for all my meals I never bought groceries because it didn't make any sense CU I was like well if I close a sale that's $500 and that's all my Chipotle for like 2 weeks and then I can not worry about food at all and then the next hour I can close another $500 and be like well that's that's my cleaning for the month and then the next hour right see what I'm saying here but if if you if you think small you stay small like you got to be willing to take the BET and if there's ever been somebody to reinvest your time
(40:48) into getting more skills why on Earth would you not do it for [Music] you all right [Music] all right okay so I'm going to do two more okay I'm good so I got I'm going to do two more two more quick topics so one of the things that I pred myself on was buying education buying experiences buying help to move faster and anyone here have a client that you're like they're just an amazing client I could have just said like run that way and eat less and they would have just succeeded like hands if you had that client I love that client they
(41:32) leave the best testimonials they're the great before and after pictures on the other hand who here's had Susan you already know Susan we all know Susan right Susan has a slow metabolism all right she has very bad genetics and uh big boned is you know everyone in her family is and uh you know she's been to a couple doctors they gave her some medications and nothing's worked and you know when you start she's already blamed nine people for the fact that she cannot control this being real how do you think you get fat this just this this one activity
(42:17) that's it and she's blamed every other person on Earth for the fact that she can't stop doing it some of you guys guys are Susan with your business you're not this person who can go watch a YouTube video and immediately execute everything and be an amazing client you're Susan you're saying my market sucks my leads are bad like this the price change didn't work for me my turns High because people don't value my product duh and so it's just this loser Vic wanting to buy things only to prove that it won't work for you so that you can be
(43:04) self-affirmed in the fact that it's not your fault it's ridiculous it's Susan you're a Susan Susan Sucks and the thing is is like I if like even one of you is like you know what I do kind of do that my goal of every time I get into anything that's education based has always been to not be a success story but to be the number one person they have ever had and to be real I was like CU it's about me not you I will win I don't care if they're a mediocre teacher I'll still learn it and I'll still out execute them and I'll get better than they are at their own thing so that people start asking me to teach
(43:52) them and that's more or less happened in my life but the idea that you can have like there's no there's no savior gym launch is not your savior we're not going to save anybody we'll tell you the stuff that you need to do and if you actually do it you'll win but the if you actually do it is the part that most people suck at and so I'm trying to give you these hours things of like okay buy buy 96 hours back I'm trying to give you this this stuff of don't go into anything with the idea that you want like if you
(44:25) ever buy something with the intention of proving that it doesn't work shame on you it sucks what a terrible way to live like go into it trying to be the person who gets so good that they that the the business asks you for advice and I don't know where where when something snaps in you but like I've seen it happen there was a gym owner years ago who was a Susan just moaned just moaned it's all all moaning just moaning all day about his life and I remember having like hopping on a call or being a little bit rougher than I normally am and he like Snapped out of
(45:11) it and then he became one of the top gyms and then we hired him on same guy same information completely different perspective on how he chose to execute it and so like if you like so many here who hear God into fitness because you like Fitness there's a passion of yours right you need to start learning how to love business because if you treated your business the way you treated your body you'd make a shitload more money and so one of the interesting things about the fitness space is that I see the posts I actually see a lot more
(45:46) of your guys stuff than you guys think where you make these posts about being disciplined right about doing the hard work when no one's looking right that's right Day 72 you know still cranking still out here 4:00 a.m. getting it in but it doesn't make you tough because you like it what makes you tough is doing [ __ ] you don't like and right now you don't work your leads you don't follow up with customers you don't send handwritten cards you don't have member events you don't spend money on ads you don't learn editing software so you can make better ads you
(46:24) don't research what you're going to say in the ad so they're actually good you don't practice your sales script you don't set up your lobby you don't put reviews online you don't ask people for reviews you don't ask people for referrals you don't try and make affiliate Partners but you're tough because you can drink egg whites the only person you fool is you and so I just I just I want everyone here to make a lot of money and I want you guys to have the gyms you want and believe it or not the gym business has not changed you still have to promote it you
(47:08) still have to convert those leads and then when they come in you have to price appropriately so that when you're at capacity you're making a lot of money and you have to do whatever you can to keep people that's not going to change it's just your dedication to the execution of it that will and so I'll I'll bring up a my my second to last Point depending on when they kick me off your team sucks we thought earlier about your favorite employee right now picture your least favorite employee also Susan Susan Sucks so Susan everybody got Susan in
(48:05) their mind that that one person that you're like you know it's our second quarter in a row we've been I think she's going to turn the corner yeah me she's she she can be tough sometimes yeah fire Susan please fire Susan she's not going to turn around she's not going to make her business better what you see is her best behavior her best behavior and the moment you fire her you're going to hear horror stories from all the customers they going to come up to be like oh my God thank God you fired Susan she was sleeping here once oh my gosh the other day you wouldn't believe what she said to me all of this stuff fire
(48:42) Susan because the other thing that Susan does is she sets the bar for your standards and I can tell you that the one of the biggest things that like if I can identify something in an entrepreneur to know that they're going to win I just look at their team I don't even have to look at them I just because they're the ones doing it and I'll tell you a story Le if I I can tell a PG version of this I'm just going to be real with you [Music] so when I started talking to private Equity groups to consider selling a
(49:21) portion of gym launch so we could reinvest in some of the stuff that you guys will see soon it's dope um I had all these calls with investment bankers and private Equity groups and I remember so starkly the contrast between the quality of the questions that they were asking and how intelligent every single person on their team was compared to my team that I had built and we built you know 50 100 million doll business not bad but they were going to go make an extra three billion and it was this moment where I was like oh there's just more levels it just keeps going Steve Jobs SP the vast
(50:05) majority of his time bringing in talent because fundamentally someone else can run your facility better than you the problem is that you can't get that person to work for you because of who you are because of the people that you allow to be in your vicinity they would walk in they would see the other people and be like oh I don't want to associate with them and they just walk out the other side and so you need to raise your standards and right now I'll bet that the vast majority of the people that work in your business are mediocre and that's why your Gym's
(50:45) mediocre because if we're being real they're the ones that are doing everything they're the ones that are teaching the classes they're the ones not working the leads when you tell them to they're the ones not following the sales script when the person walks in the door they're the one forgetting to write the handwritten cards they're the ones that show up late to the event that they're supposed to be the champions of and invite their people to but they didn't they're the ones that don't wear the uniform the way you ask them to because they want to be
(51:10) special has anyone dealt with any of this stuff yes but you tolerate it and so it's your fault and so the better the higher my standards have become the better my teams have become the easier business has gotten because solving the business problems aren't complicated it's the everything else it's the fact that Susan Still takes up your time the fact that you like when you're in bed at night and you're talking to your spouse and you're like God Susan I just I I want to beli but this is the third time she was late and I'm just
(51:54) third time third what happened after the first one right and we're spending all this time all this bandwidth that you could be spending actually improving the business not and so Susan's cost isn't just the fact that she sucks at her job she also repels anyone who's good she also is bad with customers and she drains the single most important resource from the most valuable employee in the business which is you and so you just have to raise the standards like if I was going to spend a day with each of you I can promise you half the conversation I'd be like okay
(52:35) so when you leave here today you're going to you're going to stop spending 96 hours a month on stuff that you can Outsource for $1,500 you're going to spend the four hours you just gained back actually doing whatever the constraint of the business is so you actually make more money and you're going to get rid of all the people who suck now part of you I can already hear it like but what am I going to do with the bad work that she's going to stop doing right what am I going to do about the work she's not doing that she
(53:05) pretends to do that I pay her for anyways and this is the real talk I'm burning through these pages I would say you can say it with me but we're going to miss time it it'll be really messy so so you can just think it with me double time so this is a concept that I have spent almost my entire life living by which is that I spend half my day working tomorrow's job and the other half of the day working my day job and by thinking about my time this way I can move on double time I can move at twice the speed but that does compound over time and
(54:02) so if you have to take Susan's work over I'll bet you that what took Susan 20 hours that you pay her 40 for you can do in five and because you haven't done it in a while you'll probably realize there's a bunch of systems you probably clean up and then you'll get close to the customers not a bad thing and when you bring that next person in you'll have been fresh on it and you can actually train them how to do it the right way and put a good feedback loop in for when they do it right so one of the big problems with management overall is that
(54:34) it's basically if I don't say anything you're doing great and when you mess up I hammer you what you want to be able to do is give people a cookie when a plane lands on time rather than only when plane crashes happen because it's it's kind of like if you do something for your spouse let's say you wash the dishes because they like that you wash the dishes if you do that three four five times and they never say thanks you're just like either this isn't important or I just don't I don't need to do this and they think the same way about their role so if you just say hey do
(55:07) this thing and you never say it again and you ever tell them a good job when they do it they will do it one time and then stop doing it because you didn't talk about it and then you find out months later that this thing you thought was happening isn't happening and you've been paying them for it the whole time and so I promise you if you think Susan Sucks she probably sucks more than you think she does and she's not doing nearly as much work as you think she is either and the work she is doing also probably not that good so we have our big sticky
(55:34) note number one 4 hours per day on the constraint which for what it sounds like everybody here is you're not advertising enough number two you're going to replace all of the time that you spend doing human stuff you're going to pay someone else to do it for you so I'm going to say replace hours with vendors for human stuff three get rid of Susan but here's the thing I say this we laugh we have a good time you get on the plane you go back and guess what you don't do you don't get rid of Susan so let's let's let's explore this you don't get rid of Susan
(56:34) because you're afraid of the conversation and not the way you think it is not you're afraid of I'm not afraid of Susan yeah I know I know you're not afraid of Susan to some degree you like Susan Susan was there in the beginning you know she she hasn't been always the best but she's been there for you you know and you care about her as a human being and you're like I don't know what Susan's going to be able to do I don't even know if she' be able to get a job after this imagine no one wants to hire Susan and that's what you're afraid
(57:07) of you're like so I'll do it and so you then decide you know I'm just going to have a talking tour with her that's what I'm going to do I'm not going to f i I know Alex said this but I know better so I'm just going to tell her she's missing expectation and it's it's not her fault it's not your fault Susan I like I haven't I haven't been a good communicator and I haven't been clear about it and and it's it's okay this is this is good this is communication this is how we get better right you have this whole talk and Susan keeps
(57:42) sucking we laugh but this is what's going to happen for 90% of you in the room you're not going to do it and so the reason the vast majority of business owners stay mediocre stay small is because they can't make the hard call they can't say I love you Susan I also love every other person who works in this business and all of the customers and so I have to let you go and I still love you as a human being and then you're like wow that felt great geez and then you look you're like oh my God you did this all wrong
(58:24) uh and then you have space to go bring someone else in who's right because the process of building the gym is that you learn all the roles you do them well you train someone else do them and then eventually if you get all those people right you don't have to do anything and you can own the asset and then you can do it again as a side note I haven't seen anybody scale brick and mortar chain service businesses without having an operator that has a profit share I'm just letting you guys know this is what
(58:53) I've seen it's usually 10 to 20% they usually Mak in the neighborhood of like 75 to 100,000 a year so if right now you're like I would really like this thing to just be an asset that makes me money until you can get to that point it's not in the cards because somebody who really can run the business is going to make S you know 75 grand to 100 Grand today to do it and so you need to get everything so dialed that they can make that and you make money that's how it has to work so I'm just telling you guys right now because
(59:25) the amount of you seen this one too my gym is making money I just signed a lease to my second location even though I was literally not profitable for months before gym launch Santana seen it you've seen it a lot of times a lot of times don't be that gym owner get it so that you are bored out of your mind for months on end and you keep hitting kpi you keep growing you keep becoming more profitable if you can't leave the business for 6 months and it still grow you are not ready the business model isn't ready now some of you are like man that's a really high bar welcome to growing a legitimate
(1:00:07) business it's what it is so we have 5 minutes left I want to make sure that the sticky note that you actually do when you get home has the right stuff on it okay so who here after hearing this is like I'm not advertising enough thank you who here is going to get rid of all the human stuff for $1,500 a month so they can do that thank you and who here for the love of God instead of wussing out and pretending like you're making progress and saying that you didn't communicate when you really know that Susan's never going to make it and maybe you just have to say I'm
(1:01:03) not good enough of a manager and you just have to say I'm not good enough a manager you're amazing I suck either way it's not working because I can't fire me I still got to be here sorry full credit that's a Lea quote for the love of God get rid of Susan now I'll give you a belief that I have about about Talent which is that you absolutely can train anyone to do anything I believe that in my core the question is whether it's worth it like I think everybody here could be a neurosurgeon if given enough time it's just that who's going to pay for that
(1:01:47) and some of you would take a while like a while I've seen some of your hands man some [ __ ] sausage like I don't know brain you you do it eventually but the question is whether you want to be the one to incur the cost because fundamentally all business is is reallocation of resources you have time you've got money and you've got energy and you put it in and the people who get the best Returns on it make the most money and so when you're spending all this time on Susan you could just take a seven and make them a
(1:02:18) 10 and it would take you less time you literally get a better employee to be better even faster instead of riding this ride you keep having with Susan over and over again does everyone know who their Susan is in their mind right now so number three on the sticky note will you please for the love of God get rid of Susan actually can I get hands all right please remember if you raised your hand and 30 days from now Susan's still here I just need you to write on your mirror and just accept the fact that you can't have hard conversations and you will never grow your
(1:03:10) business you're in a service business service buses are people it's culture and training all of those are interacting with others if you cannot have a hard conversation which I to find a hard conversation some it's easy to have a hard conversation with someone you hate cuz you're like I been waiting for this I hate this guy yeah Todd you know when you're taking all those pictures of you shirtless in the bathroom yeah customers didn't like it but I've been such a good yeah got to go sorry man totally believe you think you're amazing be awesome and
(1:03:41) you're like I hope that guy never calls me again easy if you hate the guy hard if you like the person but like this is what being a grown-up is it's like you got to be able to have these hard conversations you got to be able to say it's not working now and so many of you have Personnel issues I know this cuz I spent days and days and days and days with deep Dives in the business and honestly you don't need a deep dive in the business what you're not doing is obvious and so I put all my effort on why you're not doing it which is that your time is getting sucked up with human stuff and your attention's getting
(1:04:17) drained by girls like Susan and guys like Todd cool all right thank you guys so much

7 Secrets Behind Chick-fil-A’s $50B Empire - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TIH1w-KuATk

Transcript:
(00:00) Chick-fil-A makes more money than McDonald's Starbucks and Subway combined and their first day in business they made fifty dollars and today they make over five people I love Chick-fil-A I love their sandwiches I love their desserts I love their milkshakes I love their waffle fries I love their sauces I love their tenders but what I love even more than that is their business because there are lessons that all of us can take in terms of how they do business not what they talk about socially but the actual business of running a
(00:33) business and how you go from 50 to 5 billion and I can promise you it's not by doing what everyone else does and they did that without raising tons of debt they did it over 76 years they did it after the founder died and have continued to grow and they never had a down year where they went down in sales for 76 straight years they sell one quarter the amount of items of any other franchise Subway has seven and a half percent net margins their royalty alone is 15 of Top Line meaning their stores are running 20 30 plus percent margins
(01:06) in brick and mortar food and they do that being open only six days a week having 52 days a week that they are closed unlike any other franchise no franchise he can own more than one location unlike any other store they get sixty thousand applications a year and they only award less than one percent of those people a store and they do it with arguably a very controversial social setting that would never work in a publicly traded corporate company that has to massage its PR so here are the lessons that I take away from
(01:36) Chick-fil-A that I've tried to apply at as many different places in the portfolio companies that we own and even just at acquisition.com at the holding company number one is that they sold chicken sandwiches for 76 straight years and I don't think they're going to stop having singular focus on the core products and not getting cute and not getting fancy and not having 49 menu items but just saying what are the things that the most people want and how do I get better and better and better at doing those things because better gives
(02:00) you leverage it means the same input gets you more output rather than having lots of different things you have to put input in you just put more and more and more because you only have so much Juju if you had two items you can only split test them half as much as you could want for example if you think about this like an Olympic runner the difference between first place and fourth place in the Olympics is a tenth of a second but the difference between first and fourth for a person's life massively different we get these
(02:23) outsized returns by making these marginal improvements of being better rather than being new despite our entrepreneurial desire to have not a chicken sandwich we're like what about tacos what about Burgers right like how many times could they have done something like that but they did it because they knew that they wanted to stick to the essential few and they knew that focus is what was going to compound over the long term despite being publicly criticized for not taking on debt and not trying to grow faster for talking five six seven
(02:49) eight years having somebody beat him Boston Market remember Boston Market when they had their rotisserie chickens and the mac and cheese and all that stuff they took on a ton of debt grew super super fast and then imploded Boston Market shot up and then shot down because he wasn't thinking on a five or a ten year time rise if Esther Kathy has literally sold chicken sandwiches from the time he was 25 until the day he died he was a missionary not a mercenary he wasn't doing it to brag about his ego he was doing it because he believed that
(03:14) this way of doing business was what he wanted to represent I know that the likelihood that my competitors are going to be here in 70 years is almost zero so if I build in a way that I'm going to be here in 70 years I will win by default and I think that's powerful because so many people want to say they're number one the question is when you look at the richest man in the world I want to be the richest man in the world you got to respond to somebody's answer with for how long because eventually you die what are we
(03:41) aiming towards for him he wanted to build an amazing Chicken Franchise his legacy outlasted his life and for me that's my dream My Hope Is that whatever we build can continue and not only just stay alive but grow Beyond us and that you can only do through a mission not through a mercenary cause because if you're just chasing the money people get deluded out because there's always a shiny easy win that distracts from the core items the fact that they don't let anyone have more than one store I think there's a lot of wisdom to this so there
(04:10) are lots of people like let me let me open a hundred and they're like no because you're not gonna be able to focus we want someone to put their heart and their soul into their location and treat it like it's their own while he was alive you have to have worked at a Chick-fil-A I think they loosened that up because you wanted to create a way for people to come in mopping floors flipping burgers going all the way up and then eventually own their own franchise he has profit check now mind you he doesn't share the whole profit
(04:31) but after he takes his pieces off they have an ability to make more money and having that kind of I'll say uncapped earning potential for somebody is very inspiring but he keeps it constrained to a singular Focus because they know that somebody can give it their all at one location they've already tested that they've learned over the years and I think there's a lot of wisdom in that that we can take for our own businesses number four sang No on Sundays means that you have to say no to things that are obviously going to make you money
(04:56) but will detract from your values and so there are lots of opportunities on entrepreneurship and you probably have some on your docket right now that you're like I don't know this is a little left of center but like such an easy win imagine the new CEO comes into Chick-fil-A tomorrow and says you know what I found a way to make us 13 more sales and have most of that drop to bottom line they're like What's your amazing idea and he's like we're going to be open also on Sunday it would be such an easy play and imagine how hard it is to say no because
(05:20) in the beginning he had to say no to an extra 13 on a million dollars it makes it another hundred and thirty thousand but when 13 is 650 million dollars and you still say no it means that you're appealing to a higher power something above the money values matter more than just about anything in my opinion if they are true to the founder true to the business and they operate in that way and I would say that Chick-fil-A is a great example of a type of company that believes in its values through and through and they practice
(05:47) what they preach pun intended now I also believe that appealing is something above the money long long makes you more money but you have to say no in the short to get the long yes one of the things that permeates any Chick-fil-A if you've ever been there is that they have a culture of service you're one separate way from an awesome lunch meal it'll be a pleasure serving you at our drive-thru window after two more things you know what that is just gonna beat you guys are awesome one and two yeah all right thank you Chick-fil-A and so
(06:14) what they did was they actually studied the hospitality industry and even hired people from Ritz Carlton to help them create an Exquisite experience at Chick-fil-A es true Kathy noted that when he wanted everybody in his team and his company starts saying my pleasure it didn't change until he changed how he spoke he's trained all of us to always respond to thank you by saying my pleasure so if somebody wants a refill my pleasure people will learn 10 times more from watching what you do than listening to what you say and so if you
(06:45) say hey we're all about being on time here but you the CEO are late it will never work we have to pick the very few values that we know that we will never break that we will always stick with which is why values have to be true to you not nice words on the wall because they have to be things that you would actually live otherwise they are meaningless if you want to have a business that grows even longer and bigger you want to have a compounding vehicle built within the business Chick-fil-A has a compounding vehicle of
(07:12) capital within their business whenever a store creates money they have the cash and they can pick the next location they buy the land and they buy everything itself too so they get the high return and they get some tax benefits and so if there's ever areas in the business that we can get some kind of compounding effect where money compounds on itself that is something that I always try and build in every business that I have is how can I get this money that I'm getting today to make me even more tomorrow within the structure of the
(07:38) business not taking the money out and putting into stocks or putting it into just like a random fund or whatever it is but actually saying within my business where I have active control where I get the highest returns based on my skill and my competitive advantages I get higher returns and that's how these guys build Crazy wealth that beats the market ruthless prioritization on the essential few items that they need to sell the fact that they haven't changed their menu in decades should be a testament to the fact that we as entrepreneurs want
(08:06) to change it all the time there's a Henry Ford story that I think drives his home he was looking at a marketing campaign and he had been working on it with his Executives Etc three or four months in he walked past his marketing cmo's office and was like hey when are we going to stop running that out he's like I'm so tired of it and the marketings I've looked up to him he was like you haven't even ran it yet and so the thing is is that we have all these things that happen in our mind because we're always iterating like we assume
(08:27) everyone knows everything about our products we assume everyone's already bored of it because they're talking about chicken sandwiches 24 hours a day but reality is that most people might get Chick-fil-A once a month right as a treat the customer's perception when we change something slowly in our mind every six months as a small business to a customer it just feels like it's constantly changing there's no consistency people value consistency people want to know that when they exchange money they're going to get the
(08:49) thing that they liked last time and if you make the same thing the same way over and over again it also gives you the opportunity to improve move it if you have to improve a hundred things it's a hell of a lot harder than improving two or improving one and so you've heard me say one product one Avatar one channel for anybody who's trying to make their first million each one of these stores if you think about them as a single business like that's how they're thinking now do they have drinks yes Etc the principal behind
(09:12) it compared to everyone else in the marketplace they have a quarter the amount of things on their menu compared to McDonald's and they make twice the money they have such a refined menu because it makes the order process have fewer mistakes in it it makes the drive-through process happen faster they're able to have less food go bad because they don't have to have all these extraneous options they follow Proto's principle of 80 20.
(09:32) they know that 20 of their stuff creates eighty percent of their sales they have all of these efficiencies in there because they're not trying to be cute they're trying to be the best at a handful of things and by doing that they've been able to sell way more than anyone else does with a way more constrained menu and do it so much more profitably there's wisdom there and so I try to think about that is like okay even though I could do those things should I and most times the answer is no I should just get better at the thing that's in
(09:57) front of me and confront the problem that I have which is how can I sell more chicken sandwiches whatever your chicken sandwich is and to drive even further on the phone Focus they have even at a micro level within their core product the chicken sandwich if you compare that to McDonald's Big Mac or Burger King's Whopper McDonald's big now has six ingredients the Whopper has seven not including the bun now compare that to Chick-fil-A's sandwich which just has butter pickles and chicken that's it they even have
(10:27) half the ingredients on their one-quarter sized menu because even then they get more efficiencies at the ingredient level they make it faster and easier to prepare so it's more consistent and they're able to do that with greater economies of scale and they can make the process itself leaner and faster and leaner and faster and then you do that for 76 years and become unbeatable so one of the things that when they were asked why are you so limited in their in your selection besides all the reasons I already gave
(10:51) their response was that every time they added another item they just saw their sales of their main thing declined so they're just splitting some sales off the thing their core products and so how many of us have opened a new thing got people to switch from the old thing to the new thing and now you're doing two different things for the same amount of money sound familiar happens all the time and so it takes the discipline to say no and say we're just gonna get better the last piece that makes them exceptional I
(11:16) think is their VP of growth who was talking about this you said 80 of what fast food restaurants do between each other is the same but I wasn't hired here to do the same thing to the other 80 are doing I'm hired to do what the 20 are not doing that much more efficiency has been driven into how can we improve this business because if we change nothing about this business we sell the same 12 items you just get better and better and better at the same thing they even do practice runs in an indoor arena for the drive-through to test in real
(11:43) world scenarios to see how they can make the drive-through more efficient and increase the accuracy that's the level of detail that the kingpins can do because they've been doing it for 70 plus years the biggest takeaways I see from the big companies that I try to apply to my own business is what is a business that I could be in for a hundred years I believe that if you only try and solve the same problem for 100 years you get pretty darn good at solving it after Kathy lived that and then he I mean technically even died
(12:08) that he took one concept a chicken sandwich and thought how can I just do this one thing that everyone understands better than anyone else and he built an Empire and he built a mission behind it that I think millions of people are happy and frequent every day he has edged his way to now being number three and likely will become the second biggest food chain in the entire United States

(00:00) a lot of literature and videos and blog posts talk about setting goals and I hate almost all what I'm going to walk you through is our four-step goal setting process and I promise you it's probably not what you have seen in the past from basically another company because I actually didn't take how we set goals from any business books I actually took it from a science book number one is what problem are we solving a lot of times you realize that you're not solving a problem at all which means you probably don't need to
(00:29) do it this is especially true the lower in the organization it goes because people who are lower down in the org tend to not be as connected to the overarching picture of the company simple example most goals have to be chunked up to one of three things number one they're going to help us get more customers number two is that it's going to help us make customers worth more and number three it's going to increase the Enterprise value of the company if you can't articulate why the goal is going to do that then you shouldn't do it so
(00:55) number one pick what problem you're actually trying to solve simple example if it decreases the page load times on all of our sites we will get more leads we get more leads we get more customers Etc if it improves the sign-on process for customers to have access to something that will mean we have fewer customers churn which means we will make customers more valuable if you can't tie how your department and the function that you have either gets us more customers makes them worth more increase the Enterprise value of the business
(01:24) means you don't understand your job and if you're the entrepreneur or the head of the department you don't know how you're actually providing value the business breaking that down is the first and most important part of goal setting if this process actually makes you think that it means you're doing it right because if you can just knock out your goals really really fast it probably means you haven't thought through them well enough number two we create a hypothesis and the reason for that is when you set a goal usually it's like we
(01:46) want to do this thing right well you're not actually trying to do the thing you're hoping that something's going to happen if you do the thing we like to Define both of those variables in the hypothesis for example if I wanted to have a sales goal it might say something like if I decrease the time to call leads from 30 minutes to five minutes we will get a higher percentage of leads to book calls that's literally the hardest part of this whole thing is what is the hypothesis that you're trying to test because whenever we actually do
(02:11) something in the business we're not guaranteeing the outcome and we're not guaranteed from the business that it's going to create the result we want I'm sure you've tried plenty of things that have been goals and it didn't result in the thing that you wanted which is why you shouldn't state it as a goal necessarily but as a hypothesis what you think will happen once you have the what problem are we solving in your hypothesis of how you're going to solve it then you only have two variables that you have to determine one is what's the
(02:32) thing I'm going to do which is the activity that's the input and then what do I think is going to happen which is the output number three what are we going to do we're going to call leads within five minutes right that is the input we check that box great output is we will get a higher percentage of leads to schedule or show so you'd have your Baseline of the input which is today we're at 37 minutes and we want to be at five that's the input change the output change is going to be we go from 50 scheduled to 70 schedule that's the
(02:58) output change that is a goal that is what we call the before phase the after phase only has two columns and that's where you review after the core order is done or the year is over number four what do we think is going to happen you say okay did I do the thing did I do the input did we actually decrease the call time to five minutes if we did then that's a green and here's where this is important we may have decreased the call time to under five minutes but we may not have increased the scheduling at all that's why it's a hypothesis now did
(03:27) what I wanted to have happen actually happen and then that is where you can put comments here and so what we ended up doing is we ended up getting it down to seven minutes and it didn't improve it at all at this point we don't need to get it down to five because we didn't have any directional Improvement it takes a lot of zero to want a lot of shiny objects a lot of new things a lot of trial and error a lot of iterate iterate iterate until something Clicks in the beginning but big businesses often grow by a series of one percent
(03:51) improvements one percent one percent one percent because you've seen the excel math when you're like well if I only got 10 more people to opt in and I got 15 more people to uh schedule and I got 20 more people to show and I closed one from 25 to 35 you add all this together and all of a sudden and you tripled the business and the thing is is that everyone gets so distracted with like the I'm going to reinvent the wheel rather than just making the wheel a little smoother so it runs faster and so a lot of times especially in the 5 10 15
(04:17) 20 million dollar Top Line range that's some of the systems we have to put in place because that's how the big boys play they beat you because they actually can do a hundred tiny increments I think Jim launch grew 40 last year and we did nothing new all we did we did everything we were currently doing a little bit better if you do that year after year after year you become very hard to beat because people see your marketing on the outside they'll try and copy your pages they'll try and copy your emails in one
(04:39) it won't be you so it won't matter because it's not your story but they don't know all the internal standard operating procedures the internal message that you guys are tracking that actually create the growth in the company and a lot of times in the early business just measuring metrics may be the important goal for the quarter so that you can then improve it let's say your videographer and a marketing department right each of these goals should start from the top down so if we say these are our five goals as a
(05:04) company the department heads are going to probably have multi multiple activities to make the first hypothesis true or not I like to have everybody as far down the organization do this because it actually causes you to think about why you do what you do a lot of times employees lose motivation because they don't know how what they do every day ties into the bigger picture of how the company grows and makes more money with the vdr for example they're like well what do I do like what problem am I solving the problem is get more
(05:28) customers they might not think about it that way but that's the goal well my hypothesis is either we might say it's a volume thing which is if I double the amount of shorts I make then we will get more traffic to our website from our organic content and at the end of the quarter did you make twice as many shorts okay green fantastic did that result in more link clicks on the site oh it didn't huh interesting I wonder what would do it okay we need to create more content that's more story based great go back to the beginning if we
(05:58) create more story based content we will get more link clicks to website that's why goal setting if done right should take work because it makes you think why am I even doing what I'm doing and if you don't take like a day for a whole quarter to think why am I even bothering to do this then why are you bothering to do it without understanding what you're trying to improve and the thing is if you think this way as a teammate or an entrepreneur I promise you you will be so much more valuable to your company if
(06:23) you can even think like a business owner and this is how a good business owner should think and if you can approach whoever runs your company with this model you may find that they will see you differently because they're like wow Timmy who's making these video clips is actually thinking about what I care about which is how I'm going to get more customers whatever the second part of the statement is if you know what you're actually trying to accomplish in the business then it makes a lot easier what problem are we solving what's our
(06:46) hypothesis what are we going to do what do we think is going to happen did we do it did it happen that's it and so that has been the simplest goal setting framework that we've used we use this across all portfolio companies that's what we do across everything and it's been the simplest thing that I've seen I haven't seen it anywhere else it's worked for us and maybe it'll work for you

(00:00) I really loved Fitness macro counting different ways to exercise different programming stuff and I was obsessed with it so much so that the people that I worked with were like dude if you don't start a gym I'll pay for the gym so that you stop talking about this stuff there are three paths that every entrepreneur eventually has to take you have the path of the pure artist The Craft of the pure entrepreneur and then a hybrid path so the path of the artist is the person who loves doing the thing now your art form might be Plumbing your
(00:21) art form might be carpentry coding software making media and making wallets you have something that you enjoy doing and you do it well the second path on the extreme is that you love business business is your art form and it doesn't really matter what business you're in I love working with different portfolio companies whether it's solar sales mortgage sales physical products software service businesses brick and mortar chains like we have all of those in our portfolio and I love growing them all and that's because the art for me is
(00:45) the actual business itself the third path is a hybrid path and each of these paths can go all the way to the max limit here so an example is Tobias Luca who is the founder of Shopify and so he loves building Shopify pages and he loves the coding and the product and so what he did was he found somebody else and have them build the business around him while he stayed focused on the main thing that he loved the most the key here is that there is no right path it's more about the path that works best for you during the season you're in because
(01:13) guess what you can also change paths later if you start in the artist path you might transition to the hybrid path or you might start on the honest path and go all the way to the entrepreneur path when I started I really loved Fitness I was obsessed with Fitness I had spent years I had competed in Fitness and so all I read all day besides a little bit of personal development was like macro counting different ways to exercise different programming stuff like exercise for ways to layer workouts program all that kind
(01:35) of stuff and I was obsessed with it so much so that the people that I worked with were like dude if you don't start a gym I'll pay for the gym so that you stop talking about this as soon as I actually started a gym I realized I enjoyed business even more than I enjoyed Fitness I started as an artist of fitness and I became an entrepreneur but let me play out all three paths to their natural extremes The Artist At Its extreme is somebody who continues to not scale an Enterprise around them and continues to do the thing at
(01:58) extraordinarily high levels and so this ultimately goes from a commoditized price point to a premium price point to a luxury price point all right so Commodities price point is like if you're a plumber you do the same Plumbing work everyone else does right now if you start doing it really well Word of Mouth starts to build and you can start raising your prices because you are now a premium provider you do better work you do it faster people come to you because they trust your work right now at the highest level it
(02:21) becomes luxury you become so advanced in plumbing you can do it for a massive building or you can do it for luxury homes and you make it look more neat and awesome and cool and whatever what happens is demand continues to increase for your services or your product and so rather than increase the number of units you sell you just increase the price you still make significantly more money and a lot more profit in that business model but it still keeps you doing the core thing which is that you like Plumbing you like making wallets you like being a
(02:48) carpenter whatever you can have incredible artists who sell their paintings for millions of dollars a piece and they don't have a massive organization around their main thing that they focus on every day is the art now there's obviously elements of Entrepreneurship there but because they make money the hybrid version developer who built the little website because he wanted to make some sort of physical products business that he didn't like the tools that are out there and he started making it but then other people
(03:09) because the product was so good started asking for it now he could have just continued to raise the price of the thing but at a certain point especially with software it made more sense to make himself Chief product officer rather than CEO and then hired a CEO and hired the executive team to build everything else around him because he's a big shareholder he has a lot of sway but on the actual chart itself he might be over here not necessarily at the top because he doesn't want that life you still do your art every day but then you find the
(03:35) people now that does require skill because you need to have the perspective from which to make a judgment on who is good enough to be able to lead your company now that's where having outside advisors and things like that to help you find those people who you do trust who already have that skill who don't have a vested interest in your business so they can give you the cleanest purest advice the highest level of advice is someone who has been there done that themselves and taken other people just like me to where I'm trying to go
(03:56) multiple times a level below that is someone who has taken multiple people like me where I'm trying to go they haven't done it themselves the level below that is someone who's only done it themselves and helps no one else the level below that is someone who saw someone go all the way themselves or saw multiple other people go there themselves below that is only seeing one person and below that is your mama uncle and your neighbor telling you their two cents about how you should do business when they've never run a business and
(04:18) have no no right to have an opinion you can leverage their experience to find the right people to fit inside of your business to build the business around you the third path is that of the entrepreneur that's the person whose art form is the businesses and so rather than thinking about making wallets and making more wallets the business itself is the painting and so they will have multiple paintings in their career as they develop as an artist so too does their expression of their art and so the types of businesses they build get
(04:42) bigger more complex more or need or simpler right it just depends on what type of entrepreneur they are I'll tell you right now the amount of businesses that I've started I started a non-profit online training business I switched to a for-profit training business and then I switched to a brick and mortar gym then I had a chain of gyms then I had a gym turnaround business I had a car tractor agency I had a dental agency I had a licensing business I've had an e-commerce business that sold physical products had a software business
(05:06) software to service B2B and now I have private Equity Firm and I'm 33. as you develop as an entrepreneur your art will change and it will be continually a changing expression of who you are and it will evolve so the biggest question is which of the three are you if you love the actual doing of the business the thing you do the product or service you deliver that is your art then I would say start with the path of the artist and if you're good because if you really do love it you should be able to beat other people who don't love it and
(05:33) so you should naturally through Word of Mouth be able to get more demand than you have supply of time at that point you'll have to start making the decision am I going to go hybrid are I going to go all the way entrepreneur if you're starting out right now and you're watching these videos and you just love entrepreneurship in general and you don't really care what you sell you just want to make money then you probably are more the entrepreneur path you just want to hustle you want to figure out needs in the marketplace figure out stuff that
(05:53) people are buying connect the two dots build the organization around it put an operator in charge and then let it run and make cash flow that's the entrepreneur path the middle path the hybrid path is usually someone who starts as an artist and then becomes that because they still want to build build the beginner prize but they don't want to sacrifice the thing they love the most which is actually building the product this little product thing as a side note could also be marketing it could also be Finance if you like a
(06:18) certain component of the business you can own that component of the business and have someone build it around you you could just be the guy who loves fundraising and you just love raising funds and that's how you build your business and you get everybody else around you to run it you will still leave your thumbprint on different aspects and be more heavily involved in different departments the ones that you love the most but at this point you do it by choice rather than do it by obligation do I love the thing or do I
(06:39) love the business of doing the thing and then walking that path down and the best news is you can always change your mind later the most valuable skill that you can have in order is product first then marketing then sales and so right now if you know how to sell it's because you don't know how to Market you know how to build products if you know how to market then you can sell lots of stuff but you're only going to sell it once because the product's usually not that good if you know how to sell product you'll get more promotion from your
(07:01) customers than anything else and that is ultimately what scales the Enterprise marketing can scale anything to a point and then what happens is the marginal cost of getting the next customer continues to get oh up and up and if you don't get Word of Mouth referrals from customers who use your product then eventually it becomes untenable and your company will Plateau and so the key to building a very very big thing that lasts for a very long time is have an exceptional product and I get that you're like sure but how do I make money
(07:24) and you know what if you just sell you can make money if you Market well you can make even more money and what happens for most entrepreneurs is they actually go in that direction they just learn how to sell because that's the easiest skill to learn you can learn it in a couple weeks learn how to Market takes a little longer you learn how to write copy it's really just translating the persuasion of sales into different types of media and selling to many people at once and so the highest leverage thing you can do is make an
(07:46) exceptional product that other people want to promote for you my first real big experience with this was the book so 100 million dollar offers is a book it's 99 Cents you get on Amazon like right now it sells 25 000 copies a month with no paid ads the reason for that and a lot of people who knew me from high school or new me from college are like dude it's so crazy some guy I know from work is like dude you got to read this book and it was your book you have more people who send you business than people who leave just based on how good your
(08:10) product is that continues to compound to the end of time

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video i want to talk to you about how i made my first million dollars in profit mind you the reason i'm so big on profit rather than revenue is that at that point um i had already made you know i was already making a couple million dollars a year between all the different things that i was doing but i was taking home basically nothing because i was so smart then i wasn't paying attention to uh profit i was just looking at revenue trying to beef myself up and feel status rather than thinking about what i was actually taking home
(00:24) and um i told you in a different video how i i got a head-on collision in a dui at 60 miles an hour on the highway and walked away from it and that was kind of the catalyst that ended up changing my life in a lot of ways mostly because i decided to confront decisions that i had been putting off and make hard calls that i didn't want to make to force myself to focus on one thing and so what i want to do in this video is talk to you about the result of that decision and um what kind of happened and transpired in the next six to 12 months which is anything
(00:54) anything but a cinderella story i made the calls i i went all in on gym launch i basically fire sold my other businesses and um just as a quick tangent on that like a lot of times i think the great thing that we have um is sitting right in front of us after we let go of of the things that are holding us down i'm a big believer in the theory of constraint which is uh you know a system will grow to to up to it's basically its bottleneck right and then until you relieve that like systems will grow as long as they are not constrained and so most of us are constrained in many ways and we just do not recognize them which
(01:22) is why we have things called limiting beliefs it is a constraint right and for me in a very real way i had constraints in terms of um all the different things that i was allocating my attention to i had you know i think literally like nine or ten business businesses i'll use quotes here um that i was trying to run at the same time and i was spread so thin that i could barely allocate anything and i was working every hour of the day and i was drinking half a bottle of johnny walker at night so i just go to sleep and so anyways i i got in the head on collision i uh i decided to make
(01:47) the next uh the next move which was going all in on gym launch and this is uh the beginning of yet another hard road ahead um and so at this time for those who don't know i started flying around and doing uh done for you gym launches and so what that was was basically layla and i would go and do a gym turn around i didn't like to use that word because i didn't think gym owners liked it i was originally going to call it gym rescue um but no one wants to be rescued so i called it jim launch and everyone was okay with that name we would fly out uh two brick and mortar facilities we'd sit
(02:14) at the front desk i would spend my own money on on on everything so the offer was pretty simple i said i would fill your gym in 30 days uh for free that was that was the offer i was like i'll spend my own money on the ads i'll spend my own money on the hotels the food the everything um and the deal is i just get to keep the upfront cash that i collect and then everything afterwards that's contract value you get to keep it was a pretty compelling offer right they didn't have to do anything right they would just say yes and then i would show up i think i'd ask for 500 to reserve the
(02:40) date just to make sure that they wouldn't like not be there but i i made it a refundable deposit um but anyways i would fly out and um we would spend all the money in marketing and we would sell on average when layla and i would go we saw an average about 200 people in 21 days so he'd average about 10 sales a day and then we would take you know then we'd fly to the next one this is kind of what we had been doing in 2016 and i was doing this while also having six gyms and two agencies and and and all these other things that were going on and i was spread wildly too thin and
(03:10) that's when i got in the dui and then decided to end everything except for gym launch we ended up basically i i had to shut i had to i sold five of the six gyms i shut down the two agencies and then i had one gym that was left over and i put the money from the sale of those other businesses which is not a lot um into kind of the last facility the the partner that i had at that facility um ended up feeling like i had been taking distributions somehow from the business which i hadn't and then he took what he believed was
(03:41) rightful compensation for him not being involved in that gym anyways basically took the rest of the money out of the account and so i basically was left with nothing so i was truly at this this you know rock bottom moment of just gotten a dui i just got rid of all my gyms i put all the money from those gyms into this last facility that money got taken and i um then decided to close that one gym down and then when i did that i couldn't sell any more at that facility to generate cash flow because i wanted to close it
(04:11) down i didn't want to be involved in that gym anymore and so i basically stomached rent and payroll out of there with no new cash flow coming in and i watched my bank account basically go from some money to no money and so at the end of that we shut the gym down i got tons of refunds and things like that that ended up happening afterwards because people are weird when you when you shut a business down so heads up and so we just kept but the coach that i had at the time was just like just write the checks do right by everyone and you'll be able to you know escape this thing um
(04:44) unscathed emotionally and and more or less i did i was able like that was some of the best advice i ever got like i just i didn't try and pursue anything with the partner i just wrote the checks for all the the the customers who even if even if we had fulfilled the services we i just wrote the checks and i actually didn't layla wrote the checks because i was i was so like destroyed by this entire decision you know process but anyways i was completely you know clean slate at that point i think all in all um i had twenty three thousand dollars left over at that point
(05:15) and so uh after after selling six businesses and all the stuff i had like nothing left and this was hard for me because i just spent four years building you know six facilities and all that stuff and i almost had nothing to show for it and that was one of the biggest lessons that i've had is that like you have all these skills and experiences and character traits that you developed to show for it like the entrepreneurial journey is one that improves you not anything else and so that's why i'm such a big believer in that stuff because like i had these things these assets
(05:38) that i did not value and what's crazy is that in the next you know 30 days or so we did a hundred something thousand in sales and so i was like oh wow we uh we can do this and so anywho um actually i think what ended up happening is i had almost no money and then we did a launch and then i after all the costs and everything i think i had 20 something thousand um in in in money for me the next month uh layla and i said we were just focusing purely on this business she told all of her friends from high school to quit their jobs right so she had
(06:09) six friends from high school that all were doing mlm shake mix stuff um and she said hey you know you should quit that and start selling this stuff we can make 100 bucks a pop instead of you know making five dollars on shake mix and they were all like awesome let's do it in between month between uh i think it was like november-ish going into january which is when we wanted to slate the six gyms that we were gonna launch at the same time which of course makes sense right why go from one to two when you could go from one to six because it's a
(06:33) brilliant idea of alex's right and so we had one month in between where i was going to go launch a gym with layla we were going to do like 100 grandish and then i was going to be able to that was kind of going to be the restart money right so here's what happens next i get a text from a guy he's like hey my brother lives in the same city as uh where you're starting your new gym and i was like uh not sorry doing a launch i was like okay he's like yeah he's a salesman he really needs a job um he's got he's got a baby and he's got another one on the way and um it might be a good
(07:01) fit and so anyways i knew i needed to take a month to kind of put all the resources together to start doing the launches at six at a time and training the those sales guys and everything so i was like okay that might might work because then i don't have to spend all day selling and so anyways i trained him and he crushed it in the next 30 days he did um i think 120 000 in sales in december which is like a hard month to do it in and b it was a great first you know launch for somebody who's new which also kind of proved the model to me because i
(07:28) had done it laila done it we never had someone else who wasn't like super tied to me doing it obviously was more invested than just you know just an employee right at the time and so uh it was awesome so i was like super excited i was like sick this hundred grand is gonna be the launch money for the next thing this will be great and so um at this point layla says this guy's a winner i'm gonna take him home to meet my family which is hilarious because i was not a winner at that time and so anyways i'm at her at her family's house christmas eve and we had been selling for three weeks at this point so we had
(08:00) you know 70 80 000 in sales at this point and what was weird was i was running all the the money through just my gym processor because i still you know maintain the processing uh like my pos and um and so anyways i always got deposits on tuesdays and i was like huh this is weird we haven't gotten a deposit since like i didn't get a deposit last tuesday and i was like okay that's odd and i call them and they're like hey you know i gave it like three or four days because i was like you know maybe it's
(08:24) delayed or something and it had been a holiday because it was in the holiday season whatever and so um the deposit's supposed to hit it doesn't i wait some days keep checking doesn't hit i call them they say hey you're in an annual review it's standard nothing to worry about and i was like that's weird i've been with you guys for five years i've never had an annual review interesting and then waited a couple days called again was like hey man like we're really gonna need these funds like i need you to deposit these um and they're like yeah it's we're we're just working through some final
(08:53) things blah blah blah i was like all right and so christmas eve uh i call them and uh we're supposed to launch six gyms starting on the 26th so two days later i called the guys up and i was like i'm not getting off the phone until you send me the money like i'm not like i need there's a hundred grand that's sitting there like i need that money the guy was like sorry you know we're seeing some regular activity uh in your account and this is because we had written all these refund checks for for uh clients when i was closing down the gym the the last gym that i had so there's
(09:22) been some regular activity this isn't the way that um you know you're not you it seems like you have a virtual business now that's not what this is intended for this is supposed to be for a single brick-and-mortar location so we're going to hold on to all the funds for six months and i i lost i lost it um and for those who don't know me when i lose it i don't actually get like explosive i just get incredibly cold and very mean and so i probably said some of the meanest things like i didn't cuss i was just like i destroyed the person's
(09:47) character that i was talking to on the phone like that person questioned like why they were alive and so anyways i got off the phone and uh layla and i as parents are supposed to go to the movies because it's it's christmas eve and her dad was like you know he seems a little stressed [Music] she's like is he always this way and um and of course i was a little bit stressed at that time um and so here's what was crazy is that as we're going to the movie theaters i'm just like completely numb i just was like i feel dead on the inside and so we go to the theaters the movie's playing in front of
(10:19) me i'm not even watching the movie layla holds my hand and she's like what's going on i was like i'll tell you later she takes my pulse my resting pulse was like 120 in a dark movie theater at age 27. i was stressed out of my mind and so we left the movies um and i told her i was like the money's not coming and she was like what do you mean i was like they're keeping it she's like can they do that i was like apparently like this is the first time i'd even known this that a processor can hold money and so anyways
(10:48) i got home i still owed the salesman from the last month who had done that huge launch like this this all these sales that had happened and somebody had sold them right but i didn't collect the money from it and so i owed a 22 000 commission check and i had 23 000 left and it was on money that i never received and so um in in congruence with the the lesson that i had learned from you know the the clean exit of all these other things which is like just do right by everyone and then you won't have any emotional scars that you'll carry with you and so
(11:15) i wrote the check um actually i wired it for 22 000 and i had a thousand dollars left um and that's when we got home and i told layla you know everything that i'd done um i was like i have a thousand dollars left and we were supposed to launch she told her six friends to quit their jobs um and we were gonna start launching gyms two days later on the 26th um and i was like i have a thousand dollars and i have a credit card that has a hundred thousand dollar limit i was like i will do this i was like but this could go horribly wrong so you don't have to stay with me if you
(11:45) don't want to and um that was like this was the moment for me that i that i knew i was going to marry layla and she said i would sleep with you under a bridge if it came to that she's like we'll get through it and that was when i just like i wanted to like you know i would i would have been teary but i was so emotionally numb at this point that i just wanted to just like keep moving forward and keep keep keep getting through it and so anyways 48 hours later um i make all the ads i set up all the campaigns
(12:12) all the funnels all the everything's and uh i remember turning the campaigns on for all the six locations that we're gonna do it's like off to on off to on off on off to on and i remember i was sweating i was literally sweating when this was happening because i just felt such dread i was like this could literally just ruin me like right now i have no money but i'm i've never i'm not in debt um and i'm going to be going in debt at a at a rate of 3 300 per day of money that i do not have and so anyways i turned it on and the six guys were at the locations i was and it was 3 300 a day
(12:44) because i was paying for hotel airfare food car ad spend and commissions every single day for six guys and i had remember i had a thousand dollars right and so it was all coming out of a credit card in the next 30 days um and we ended up getting canceled by the processor right i told you this at the beginning of the story so i started all this and i had no way to process money so these guys are getting leads they're making calls they're closing deals and i can't process the money all right and so so we're sitting there right and and and these contracts are just coming
(13:19) in right and we had them scan them so we had this mobile app and we had this central dropbox which of course is not pci compliant i had no idea what pci compliance was um and so we had this uh one lady that we used to work fiji that i was paying part-time to process this mind you i didn't understand what like how much work this was because we were doing like 50 sales a day right um between these locations at like 500 bucks a pop and i was paying someone for part-time four hours a day of contract work which was just insane it was like it was probably two people's worth of work and i was paying somebody part-time
(13:50) it ended up that ended up blowing up because she couldn't do that and her full-time job so and and we didn't even have a way to process the money anyways right and so anyways we're i'm calling everybody i know to try and figure i was like hey can you process this and then you can keep 10 and just send me the rest of the money and people were like i don't know man like i don't know if i want to do that and so no one would process the money for me and so um i called you know every person i knew and then i finally got in touch with a guy named alex roy at the time uh who specialized in like high-risk
(14:20) processing which is basically the category i was in at that time and he said i can get you set up and i was like okay cool um he said but given the record that you have right now because you just refunded all those all those people at the last okay she's like they're gonna want a reserve which means they keep a certain percentage no matter what um and they're gonna put a limit on how much you can you can you can charge and i was like okay cool he said they'll give you a 50 000 limit and i was like dude i i need like four times that and he was
(14:44) like sorry man that's what i can get you um and so the last week of january all right so we were doing you know we're doing five six you know thousand a day um in sales maybe more than that and i had no way of processing it right and the last week i get this processor for 50 000 and i run i run 50 000 in a day right and uh he's like okay here's the good news is that it's per month so it was the end of he's like so this week you can do 50 and then next week you can do 50. and then i'll see if i can get more lined up more processors at 50k to allow you to start processing for them and i
(15:15) was like okay fine so next week we do 50 on that same processor and then we set up another one um and another one another one and i was able to like catch this this falling plane as it's going um and we ended up um somehow i think we ended up processing 100 grand actually that first one i think he got two people he got somebody like the last day of the month and i processed another hundred um so another 50 to get 100 for that first month and the next month i had three processors so i was able to process 150
(15:42) and things actually started uh working out right so i you know we did a hundred thousand which basically just covered my credit card bill which is doing 3 300 a day right so i just boom i'm back to zero again but at least i like had a way of getting out of this thing right so the next month i think we did 150 or 180 i have the the chart in my book um 100 million offers uh i can't remember what it was but it was somewhere in there and so i processed that february and we actually had a profit that month so i was like holy cow like we i think we made like 30 or 40
(16:11) grand and i was like oh my god i think we might we might get out of this right but wait there's more there's more to the story it gets worse and so i think we're i think i'm in in the home stretch right and so then march rolls around all right so at this point people that we had sold in january um we we were selling six-week weight loss programs at local gyms all of a sudden i see this massive hit on the bank account for a hundred grand and i was like whoa what's going on what happened and it turned out that two of the facilities that we had launched in january um and this is now at end of
(16:45) february beginning of march um they told a number of their clients hey if you refund you can just sign up through me and i'll do it for less and so we had already paid for the airfare the flights hotels commissions ad spend for all these sales so you know the margin on this was lowish right i was probably running 20 margins and uh that hundred thousand completely wiped out all of the savings that i had had over the next the last month or two right um and uh and it was actually more than i could even handle and so we had to sell more
(17:24) to cover the refunds and so this is where things got even more fun and i say that sarcastically so this is what happened next february we do more money march i know that we have to sell even more so i hired two more sales guys we do eight launches that month and that's to cover the refunds that are starting to come in from january all right you can probably see where this is going the refunds start getting worse there's more and more and more it turns out after everything 35 of all of our of all of our sales that we were making we're getting refunded which is an astronomical number that is
(17:54) hard to even comprehend and it was because we had no control over the fulfillment right so we were selling and then other people were filling on contracts that we had sold and so and there was a lot of you know hey just refund sign up for me don't worry because we'd be gone right we were already we'd already left the location and these people were getting fulfilled on contracts and so we didn't have the relationship with the customer the business owner did and so it was a really dumb model from that perspective um i learned right one of the lessons i
(18:19) learned there was control of like you want to control everything end to end if you want a life lesson and so anyways the next month uh we're we we have to sell more and so i think we did 280 000 the next month and i was like okay cool but all of the excess cash that came from that from like the profit went into funding these refunds from the month before and then refunds just kept going up and so i knew that in april i was gonna have to sell even more to cover the refunds from february and march and i felt like i was in a death trap i was like i don't know how to get out of
(18:49) this like every month i have to sell more to cover the refunds from the month before but then the cash from these things somebody needed to cover the next month and sell even more and honestly i had no idea what i was gonna do and so um all of a sudden uh leila at this point because she still has one foot out the door a little bit because she's like i don't know about this guy um and so this whole time she'd been living on like three thousand dollars a month that she was getting from her like online coaching business so she had transitioned her personal training clients to online um and she was doing
(19:14) like three grand a month from that and i was like hey why don't we take the middleman out of this we know how to mark and sell weight loss let's just sell it online which by the way is a massive transition from doing brick and mortar um but anyways i was like you know i was in absolute desperation and so i wrote one of the best sales pages of my entire life out of just sheer need it took me two days to write the sales the sales letter maybe three and i didn't even like get up for the computer i was just writing the sales letter and so um
(19:39) i started running traffic to it and we started doing a thousand bucks a day um of just online so there was no mard there was no uh it was all margin right minus ad spend and i was like holy cow this could work right and so we had eight sales guys since i was like okay we can tell these guys they don't have to sell gyms anymore they can sell from home they can see their wives and we can do 8 000 a day because if we're doing a thousand just just with her selling we could do 870 more guys and do 8 000 a day and so i told the guys the next month uh
(20:03) the gyms that were lined up to launch the next month hey we're not gonna we're not gonna be doing this anymore sorry we're gonna be going another direction and they were like hey man like we need this and um i was like sorry man like it's just it's just i'm not doing that model anymore and um they're like well can you show us what you're doing because like my friend told me that you signed up like 200 people at his gym in like three weeks and i was like nah man sorry and uh he was like dude please like and i was like i'm not flying out there man i'm sorry i'm not
(20:31) doing it um and so anyways push comes to shove i was like fine i'll show you how to do it i was like but i'm not flying out there to save your ass you can't sell he's like no no that's fine he was like well how much to show me how to do it and um at the time i picked what was the highest number i could possibly imagine in my head which was six thousand dollars and i said that because i didn't want him to say yes and um because i didn't want to do it i just wanted to move on because i was so hopefully at this point you see how you know scarred i was by all of these experiences leading up to this um and
(21:01) the guy said okay and i looked at the phone and was like you got to be kidding me and i was like holy crap and so it was six thousand dollars and then i had seven more guys that i was supposed to call you know to tell them that i wasn't gonna do their launch the next month and so the next conversation i had i was like well shoot if i'm gonna do it i guess i guess i have to make it now that i sold one of them this whole program um next guy same conversation with the same way and he was like well how much i was
(21:27) like eight grand he was like okay and i was like holy cow and then uh every single one after that uh said yes and ended up doing sixty thousand dollars in sales in a day and i i looked at layla and i was like we might be able to get out of this and um at that time as much as people talk about the romantic like vision and strategy and and impact and saving lives and all this stuff like it wasn't any of that i was just trying to be able to not be in debt and pay to pay the bills that were mounting every
(21:56) single month off and so i knew that i needed to make like 150 000 in profit in the next like 30 days or so in order for this to work right and um this was the only way i could do it and so what i did was i i called you know those guys they all bought and then i called up every gym that we had launched at that point which was like 32 i think and i called every one of those guys was like hey you know how we filled your gym up uh want me to show you how i did that and they were like yeah that would be great
(22:22) that's exactly what we did and so i ended up doing like 300 000 in sales the next month selling a digital product which was um actually more like a consulting type thing and here's what's crazy the next 30 days the average gym that used the consulting program jim launch did 30 000 in collected cash not contract not contract not anything like that but 30 000 in sales in the next 30 days and uh and then that is when everything took off like a rocket because every single one of those guys told every person that they knew that was in the gym space like dude i just did this
(23:01) thing and it killed that was what gave birth to jim launch as it became the consulting company the licensing company where we licensed out all the materials all the ads all the copy all the scripts how to set up the the lobbies and the thing is is that when people ask me about the story and this is you know now we're six months into 2017 at this point so i've gone through like the hardest 18 months of my entire life that is when we just went from uh i think we did a hundred grand that first you know
(23:29) month or last last few weeks then we did 300 then 480 then 780 then a million then one two then one five one eight two two two like we just kept we just grew like like a rocket and a lot of people think it was because of the marketing that i was running at that point but it wasn't there was a lot of it was just the word of mouth and the actual product worked you know what i mean um and i use that as an example because like right now i launched the book 100 million offers it's 99 cents um with one post
(24:00) on my instagram which is not that big um of a following and right now it sells about a thousand copies a day with no funnels no ads no whatever um and it's because the product was good you know i mean people talk if the product's good and with this product i was able to charge an egregious amount of money but it was because we charged because we were making people so much money like if i if i gave you a system that made 30 000 on average in the first 30 days how much is that system worth right most guys charge you know for franchises
(24:30) they'll charge 500 000 for a system that does something like that right and i was just charging 16 grand because i was like holy cow like they're gonna make double their money in the first 30 days if they just do this right and i was so i knew every aspect every piece of this process because i had done it not only for my six gyms but for the 30 plus that we had launched and so like i knew the differences between different markets i knew how to train sales guys to get them to do it i knew how to position the offer i knew how to do the layout of the
(24:56) sales room in the lobby so you could maximize the amount of people that you could sell i knew how to do the nutrition consultations the next day so you could cover all the ad spend um just with product sales right like i knew all these things because i did it and so i tell this story to illustrate one thing one is that what you are going through now doesn't mean like your work works on you more than you work on it i was developing skills character traits and beliefs through this entire three four five six year period of just of just eating that i did not know was for
(25:24) me and so we think that the first business the second business the fifth business you start is going to be the business that's going to be it for you but like the journey is long you know what i mean and you accumulate these skills and these beliefs and these traits over time and uh those become the things those are your actual assets right the businesses are just manifestations of those assets in reality and so as a as as these things took off right um my you know my life radically transformed uh and the piece that i i get a lot of
(25:56) questions about is like how can i do what you did in my space or in my niche or my whatever and the thing is is people want to skip the first five years of the story right the first five years was that i i didn't sell a question how to make ten thousand dollars a month from a gym when i had my first gym i didn't do that when i had a second i didn't do that when i had a third i didn't do that one out of fourth i didn't do that when i had a fifth i didn't do that when i had a sixth right um because i didn't feel like i was good
(26:21) enough and it was only uh and even then i started doing the launches as the next thing because i wanted to make sure that everyone always got way more value than they paid me which was zero they paid me nothing that i would fill their gym up pretty good deal right no risk for them and so i did that for almost two years doing the doing the gym launches right where we'd fly out and you already know how that went which was difficult and hard for me but i learned so much i learned how to run a virtual sales team i learned how to do all these things so that when i did have the next
(26:50) opportunity that lined up for me we went from zero to 30 million in the next year in revenue because i had accumulated all of these skills in these character traits that i would not otherwise have had and so a lot of people want to just jump to that part but they don't have the skills they don't have the character traits they don't have the beliefs that align with what they want to achieve and so i'm a big believer that the foundation that you set is going to dictate the height of the peak of the pyramid that you want to build within your life and the business that you want to grow and so most people have a very
(27:19) small foundation they took a course and then they want to start selling how to you know run facebook ads right or whatever and so the the reality is that they're just not good enough and that's why the thing that they have just doesn't work that well which is why it doesn't make money which is why they don't make money right because the amount of money that you'll be made that you'll make will be will be will be predicted by the value that you provide to the marketplace that's always what it is i know this is a longer story but i think that hopefully it illustrates one that the path is not straight uh two uh it is is
(27:50) fraught with difficulty and and mind you me telling you the very the quote end of this story is that like oh yeah and then you know everything took off like a rocket all of these types of problems there was different problems that we had to solve then which is like how do you double every month and somehow keep up with high quality service and and support and and train talent while also bringing new people in and keep a culture um in all of these things but at the end of the day the product brought us so much forgiveness from our customers because they were just all making so much money um using
(28:19) the systems that we had laid out that we were able to build the infrastructure as as the plane was flying uh you know during the journey and so anyways that was um that was the transition of me going from broke and looking up bankruptcy lawyers to uh we did three million in profit just in the last like four or five months of that year and then the next year we did 17 million in profit um and that was because i switched from a a service to uh to media which has uh no cost of reproduction so there's significantly higher gross margins on it which is a better opportunity vehicle and what's
(28:52) interesting about this and i'll just i'll i'll hit this because i can probably make a video on this one concept alone but i think it's worth highlighting is that when i had my gyms right that i had relatively the same skill set right i knew how to help people lose weight i knew how to you know i needed a market i knew how to sell i had these locations all of that from there i transitioned to a done-for-you sales model right and i made more money right now i had some issues it's funny because i could look at that model now and fix it in two seconds because it's obvious what i would need to do to change the model but
(29:22) i didn't do that but i made more money in terms of revenue um and you know in terms of net margins i was making more but there was holes in the in the actual way the model was designed which is why i had to do with all these other things and then finally we switched to licensing um code and media right and that is where you know the highest gross margins exist and so i had the same skills right um but as my beliefs changed and my character traits changed and developed uh i was able to switch into better and better opportunity vehicles
(29:52) for the same set of skills and that is what that was what ended up creating the the fortune that layla and i were able to you know amass in this period of time um and it was because of of that transition through different vehicles repackaging the same skills and so the first step in this is getting the skills to to repackage and i think most people just want to skip that part which is the rocky cut scene that every single person that i know is successful does that no one wants to talk about every every
(30:16) single great big business owner that i know has had these years of thankless work where they develop these skills these traits um in these beliefs that end up setting them free and everyone wants to just take the the one course and thinks they're gonna become a millionaire in six months and it's just not the case and so um many people are far ahead of me in their entrepreneurial journey you know than i was in my first two years three years five years and so i i tell the story to hopefully give anyone hope who's like two years in and isn't making money it's like well multiply that by
(30:44) three and then that's about where i was where i started making real money so um anyways lots of love mosey nation uh love you all my name is alex for moses i'm on acquisition.com we do about 85 million a year in revenue um keep being awesome if you did enjoy this hit the subscribe button and i'll see you in the next video and if you didn't like this then i love you either way all right lots of love i'll see you then bye

Starting a software company is a TERRIBLE F@#$ING IDEA... [TRIGGER WARNING] - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pw1PcHfYP2w

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video i'm going to talk to you about why starting a software company as an information and service marketer e-course guru etc is a terrible [ __ ] idea if you don't know who i am my name is alex ramose on acquisition.com it's a portfolio of companies that now does over 100 million a year in this video i'm just here to trigger a handful of you and hopefully give a warning a strong warning to those of you who want to do it now the question you might ask is why would somebody want to start a software company when they have an
(00:28) e-learning core service etc well i'll tell you why it's because they think that one it's going to make their service company stickier because they're like ah software's sticky no no no no software is not sticky really good software is sticky your software will not be sticky and will just cost you a lot of money but let's just say that's number one reason that they want to do it the second reason that they want to do it and this is the even shittier one is that they think it's going to give them a really good multiple upon exit
(00:54) all right when they sell their company in the future now let's start breaking down why this is such [ __ ] terrible advice and idea in general now if you even look at the entire info guru etc space that's out there how many of them have had big successful software exits i'll wait right there's only one guy who may have an exit and that's alex becker and it's because he made the flip from being a guru and selling courses and things like that to a true software entrepreneur the problem is 99 of people want to continue
(01:29) to run their info business and then drive it to a software company in which case they do both kind of shitty and never actually get a the exit b sticky software and so they end up just having a kind of shitty mix in between because there's another person who's trying to solve the exact same problem and doing it better than them because all they focus on is the software right and if you're getting into the software game and you think they're like oh i'm just gonna market it and it's just like a course and then people are just gonna
(01:53) have to stick with it because i introduce them to it it's not true that's not going to happen you have to be really good at software and really know a lot about the business and not only that software is one of the hardest businesses to get into for a variety of reasons number one it costs money to develop stuff now you're like oh i'm gonna have an offshore team has its own risks right and making sure that the product is actually what you want but let's just assume that you you know have figured all that out right you have the
(02:15) cost of development that's number one number two the people you're competing against now are software people and they are much smarter in general than i would say the guru world is at large and that's because there's real money to be made there but it is a high-stakes game and if you look at like the vc world venture capital angel things like that the reason that their portfolio theory works is because they make a hundred bets knowing that two of them are going to carry the entire portfolio the thing is is that when you are one of those
(02:39) hundred the likely that yours succeeds is very very low and so what you do is you take your eye off the main game and then play the one in 50 game likelihood of succeeding and then you end up basically destroying both and wondering and then what happens is sunk cost fallacy kicks in you're like well i put all this money in i put all this time and i said it publicly my ego is now attached to it etc then you want it to be like i'm a smart cookie i'm going to move above the space but you're not and they're not going to give you the
(03:04) multiple that you think you they are and here's why it's not that tech gets great multiples so hear me out on this the future value of a company is based on a discount applied to future sales between now and the day that the company dies and so the number of sales that they think they could potentially generate in terms of how big the market could potentially be and the likelihood that those sales occur okay now if you have a software that churns people out and mind you in software world they measure churn annually not monthly annually and so if
(03:38) you have less than or above 10 annual churn on your software you're [ __ ] you're just a service business right and so you probably don't have those types of turn metrics which is probably why your software sucks and so unless you're a hardcore true god you know balls to bones software entrepreneur and you know everything about that world and you're willing to risk it to go all in on this which is why a lot of these guys use funding up front because sometimes a lot of software companies need to have funding in order to get the initial
(04:06) stuff off the ground so they can get market share and then they can start upselling people later right it's a much more competitive space i just see so many people trying to do this and it's just it's just not what you think it is right like it's just based on how likely the sales you have in your business are to occur in the future okay so insurance for example gets good multiples but all and it's because the likely that people continue to stay and use the same insurance insurer is high it's not because tech is magic or insurance is
(04:34) magic or whatever is magic if you have a service business that never loses anyone and each in each client continues to spend more with you over time you're gonna have a very valuable business period you'll get a much higher multiple right because all they care about is how likely what's my risk and then what's my upside right like that's what they're looking at and then how likely is is it that i that either of those scenarios occur and that's called risk adjusted return and so if you have something that people never stop paying for and they
(04:58) continue to buy more of it and you have more people that you could sell to in the future that's a very attractive business software is just a vehicle to get there people think that they're just going to slap you know some [ __ ] software that they have paid you know some dude in bangladesh 50 grand to put together and think that they're all of a second to take their 2 million profit business and get a 20 x top line multiple on it it's horse [ __ ] you're not going to get that like the people who are going to give you the money are
(05:20) smarter than you they're smarter than me they're smarter than all of us and the reason they have 100 million to give you is because they're not [ __ ] dumb think about that they got the money because they earned it they're not stupid right they get it by making the right bets and i mean i i heard this one the other day so what i'm gonna do is i'm gonna get people to subscribe to my software for my for my mastermind and then i'm going to classify it as a level of the software they're not [ __ ] idiots they know it's not it's not
(05:45) software that people are using because they're going to look at time on screen they're going to look at daily users and look at how much each of the each of the elements according to where they want to drive value for whatever they're buying it for they might be buying it to plug it in they might buy it because they think they can expand it they might buy it for a variety of reasons right but the real real is that most of them never get bought and it's because they're actually [ __ ] software made by people who don't understand software and
(06:07) think that they're going to decrease their turn or somehow make their business more valuable and neither of those things are true and what ends up really happening the vast majority of the time is that the product you make is not the best one on the market you start pitching it to your customers and they start complaining and they will tell you that it's not the best one and then you feel like you're losing integrity because there is a better person on the marketplace that is better for the solving the specific problem and if you
(06:30) do have a real competitor in that place who really does play the software game they'll just look at your [ __ ] and copy it in two seconds because software is a competitive space and then they'll have all your stuff plus theirs and a better user experience than you have and probably for less and so all of a sudden you're hawking something that just has a worse value proposition but you feel invested because you spent all this time and effort and you feel like your identity is tied to it and then all of a sudden your bravado kicks in because you
(06:53) don't want to be seen as a failure publicly and so recipe for failure instead alex's recommendation is stick to your game if you have a service company just make your service stickier make it more likely that people will stay with you that will increase the value of your company buy other companies that have similar names similar that are have similar characteristics and then roll them in if you so choose or find affiliate partners or get more referrals or run more paid ads or do more outbounds you can get more customers
(07:19) figure out ways you can serve more customers you can expand your tam you can just make the company you have more valuable rather than trying to think that you're going to trick some potential acquirer like they're not dumb i just want to say this again they're not stupid think about the people that you know who can stroke a hundred million dollar 500 million dollar check they didn't get there by being morons so why would you expect them to to buy your [ __ ] software that you tacked on onto your service business to automate
(07:45) one thing be like well i'm tech enabled certain no you're not you're either service or you're tech period and if you if you are a tech company then you will know you're a true tech company because you wouldn't be watching this video because you'll be like oh no obviously i love competing it's these other guys who try and make [ __ ] software right and if you're not a tech guy and that's not your world then play the game you're best at where you have a competitive advantage right this is what happens and i'm gonna
(08:10) i'll wrap it up in a second people here that you can get 10 times top line 20 times top 50 times top line right for software but that's not the vast majority of software's in general that gets sold not only that most offers don't get sold at all most software's fail like i've mentioned earlier in the vc angel example but of the softwares that sell most of them don't sell for much they sell for parts and then of the very very very small examples of the ones that hit those crazy multiples it's because they have tremendous growth
(08:36) they're not losing users they're getting people off of word of mouth the people are they hit product market fit which by the way is by use tell if the way that you get people into your software is that you sell them your service and then you tell them to use the software it's not a good software people need to buy it so that we know that the problem that we are solving is valuable to them they need to use it regularly on their own and they need to tell other people specifically about the software until those three things occur the software is
(09:01) not valuable think about it if you're just blowing people through your software software or vehicle and people cancel when they cancel your service it's just service and you just added some weird tech thing that's completely nonsensical to the service offering that you have rather than just making a probably smarter affiliate relationship with someone and getting probably more profit from that relationship because you don't have the cost of everything running the business and if you send a serious amount of traffic to somebody
(09:26) you can probably negotiate 20 30 sometimes 40 50 affiliate relations depending on you know the type of software etc and so i say this to say as a big warning to the vast majority of the people that are out there and this this tends to happen right around that like i want to say like one to threeish million dollar mark is when people think they're gonna get cute they're gonna get fancy they're gonna be like i'm smarter than the space i'm smarter than these people i'm really trying to get away from from all this guru [ __ ] all this
(09:48) all this servicing these customers who don't understand my value it's not that good that's why they're not saying like that's that's the real like you look at yourself in the mirror and be like they're not staying because we are not fulfilling our promises and then that is where you actually start to make real money and build something that's sellable and has value and i promise you that when you actually solve the problem you're not going to want to sell because you're going to love the business because customers come highly
(10:11) recommended you have a great reputation people get more than they pay for they they bring their friends you sleep well at night because your employees enjoy servicing the customers that you have segmented as your ideal avatar and those people are connected and send more people your way and because people aren't turning out the back door left and right you know that next month your month is going to be bigger than it was this month even if you do nothing that's how a good business runs and it takes time to get there and people get
(10:35) impatient and so they try and think that there's a shortcut and there isn't there just isn't you just have to be better and better takes work and work takes time it's all i got mother nation love you guys keep being awesome i'll see you guys next one

Transcript:
(00:00) You're about to see a fascinating conversation I had with Dave Ramsey where we talk about how he makes money, the advantages of inerson versus remote, a project that he lost millions of dollars on that I think has underlying lessons that any business owner can take from them. And finally, five stages of scaling all entrepreneurs go through.
(00:16) I think you're going to love it. Enjoy. Welcome everyone to the game. I'm here with uh Dave Ramsey, the man, the myth, the legend. Honor to be back with you, my friend. I'm so excited with everything that's happening with you guys. You're blowing up, man. It's pr I'm proud to watch you. It's great. Well, thank you. We're uh we're trying to trying to follow in in the Ramsey footsteps.
(00:35) There's so much stuff that I had written down um and prepared for today and I I doubt we'll get to to all of it, but if you could walk me through just kind of lay the land in terms of Ramsey solutions as the business exists today because I think it'll be helpful for the audience to give context. Yeah. What what ended up happening with us was we classic entrepreneurs.
(00:52) um you know we were um a wee bit ADD and so uh you know just something something flashy and uh shiny went in front of us. We would look at it because but it all came through the funnel of or or the filter of does this serve our mission and our mission is just to help people uh with common sense education and empowerment in some area in their life. It started in the money piece.
(01:18) And so when I first started, I was doing a free uh I was working for free at a talk radio station, doing a little talk radio show on the local station and I print a little book, started selling it out of the trunk of my car. So publishing was born, right? Uh then we did an event at the local Ramada in so live events were born and so each of these uh in those days everything was analog.
(01:41) Of course the internet comes along and one of these kids working for me comes in and goes, "Hey, we need a website." And I'm like, "What's that?" And so we built a website on one of those tiny little uh antique. You ought to look them up. They're cool. Those little first little Apple computers, the first little they look like a little shoe box. And uh he built it built us a site on there with Cole Fusion. And it was pitiful. But it was still cutting edge.
(02:02) Uh it was a big time deal in those days cuz nobody had a website. We had one of the first people had a web store to sell stuff because it was a platform. Again, platform platform platform. So, we're platform agnostic. And anytime we see a an a new and or emerging platform, analog or digital, we're going to put our toe in the water and keep doing the ones we're already doing. We're not going to abandon them. If they die on their own, fine.
(02:28) Uh if something runs its course, we're done with it. But, uh but but and you know, we just go on and do the next thing. And guy walks in my office in the early 2000s, we need a podcast. What's a podcast? I don't even know what this is. And we were one of the first uh certainly one of the first in talk radio to put a podcast out because the talk radio people resisted it.
(02:46) They were afraid it was competition. So on and on and on and on it goes. And and now we end up today we've got about 14 profit centers here um inside the organization. Today there's about,00 of us 650,000 foot campus that were uh you know that you've been here and hung out with us at our home and um and so we've got the entree leadership brand where we're teaching leadership and coaching small businesses and we've got events around that, books around that.
(03:12) The book we're talking about today is from that that idea. Uh, and we've got a huge coaching business in that area, coaching small businesses, uh, 200 and fewer team members. And, um, we're not real good with the large corporate goobers. We don't help them much.
(03:32) So, um, and then we've got the, uh, uh, obviously we've got all the stuff in the money space. Financial Peace University is now digital. Uh, it's no longer a VHS or a DVD or even an MP3. It's a digital format. Uh, we're rolling that up into slowly. Uh we're in beta to slowly start to move pieces of that into the Every Dollar app uh which is the largest budgeting one of the largest budgeting apps on the planet right now. We've had 50 million downloads with that.
(03:56) Um that app is huge. It's exploding and it's a fabulous it's very robust. Our tech team has done an incredible job. So, that's the digital very scalable thing, you know, on uh, you know, one end of the barbell. And then we've still got coaches over on the other end.
(04:15) And we still do small high-end ultrav platinum events where 25 people go to my, uh, event barn at my farm and hang out with me for a weekend. Uh so we go all the way we you know we stretch the spectrum from uh the high margin highouch uh uh expensive thing all the way over to free on on the every dollar app or free on the podcast uh consumption or the YouTube consumption.
(04:42) Probably more of an answer than you wanted but that we're all over the place and all of these things will have to do with just is there another way to preach this message? Is there another platform? So we're platform agnostic. Someone said, "You're you're a bestselling author." No, that author is one of the things we do. You're you're a talk radio guy. No, but talking on the microphone is just one of the things we do.
(04:59) Uh we're not and we're not we're not married to any of them. I got one wife and that's that's plenty. All right. I have I have a bunch of follow-ups on that. So, with all these different profit centers, number one is what you have 14 and it's been how many is have been 40 how many years? 35 years. 40 years since you started.
(05:18) About 35 years. 35 years. So, it's roughly like one profit center per per two and change years, right? Two and a half years almost uh on the nose um that gets started. It's been more than that because we've killed some along the way. Yeah, even better. So, what makes something worth pursuing versus what makes something a no? Is it just its on mission? Because I would imagine that there's you have resource constraints. You can't do everything that you would love to do.
(05:46) So, what what makes something quote worth doing versus not worth doing? Well, these days we we are much better. In the old days, I was just we just did it. I mean, it was like stupid. It was just stupid. And uh but nowadays, we actually do run a beta on something and we look at the ROIs and we look at the customer acquisition cost, the rorowaz, and so forth.
(06:09) And we're looking at um you know is is this a good use of our bandwidth of our marketing bandwidth of our um of our leadership time frame you know the time invested um o overhead uh committed to this project and so uh I mean we can you know we we drop a lot of stuff in the test bucket and uh but if it doesn't if it's not going to have a great rorowaz if it's not going to have a great conversion and if it's not going to have a great margin when we're done. Uh we can't afford to do it because of opportunity cost.
(06:41) Uh we can afford financially to do it, but but the the missed opportunity on something that was working 10x of what this little thing that we fell in love with over here but sucks. Um you know, we have to just let the thing that sucks die. And uh it didn't make it out of the test tube. That's all it amounts to.
(07:02) You take more of a a test test quickly, lots of ideas kind of strategy. And if something something hits then it's then you double down on those things. Is that's kind of how you think through kind of new product or expansion of kind of like profit profit centers I think is what you said. Exactly. Or and or can can we you know can we iterate it five or 10 degrees and cause it to work.
(07:19) I don't we don't kill everything instantaneously but I mean if we're going to invest even enough to get it into the test tube we're going to we're going to iterate iterate iterate before we kill it. But when we lose hope that the thing is going to have have a scale or have a margin that that is commensurate with the uh with the resources committed as you said that then you know when we lose that hope we've got to be grown-ups and go nah I really like this thing but it just it's not not it's not good business. So with these new endeavors, the first thing I wrote down when you started when you when when you brought
(07:50) it up was was who does new and the reason I bring this up because I imagine a lot of business owners have many ideas. You know, you said it earlier on like shiny object like oh this looks exciting, this looks exciting, this looks exciting. But for something to work, you typically have to have talent overseeing it.
(08:08) And I would imagine at the point that you're at now, you're probably not overseeing each of these kind of new profit centers or new ideas. Maybe they're, you know, brought to you and you review the metrics, but you're not really driving, unless you are, in which case this is an open question. Um, who who does new? Because are you going to take resources from something that's working? Are you bringing somebody new in or do you have a specific testing department that's all they do and then they hand it off to somebody else? Like, can you walk me through that process? Probably a hodgepodge of a little bit of all of
(08:34) that. I don't do it. No. Um but but what we have created is this collaboration uh freedom uh for anybody to throw an idea on the table. Uh and then you got to defend it. Uh you got to make a case for it. Um and so you can't just throw it out there and go, "Well, you guys go do that now cuz I'm so smart I came up with it." Because ideas are a dime a dozen.
(08:59) People who can implement them are the problem, right? Any one of the profit centers, for instance, entree leadership. Okay? So it's got several components to it. It's got a digital component. an entree leadership elite which is a digital coaching product for small businesses right so if somebody comes in and says I got a great idea to add something a tool to that digital product or whatever that's usually going to bubble up somewhere in that entree leadership team from that that the vice president who's running that Jason or um you know John Falcon's our senior coach over there so he's got a lot of co him and his coaches they're on the front
(09:30) lines they're they're interfacing with the customer all the time the customer's going to throw needs at them they went okay we need to serve this need, how can we do that? Is that a digital thing? Is it a a coaching need? How are we going to fill it? So, fill the need, fill the need, fill the need from an entrepreneur's perspective, but what we do is we give a lot of power to the vice president of that particular business unit uh or sub business unit uh to bubble things up.
(09:53) And then on top of that, if somebody's in another whole area, they're more than welcome to, you know, pull pull the pin on a grenade and throw it over in another area and go, "Hey guys, I got a great idea over here. I want to blow some stuff up." And so, but again, you've got to defend that and then you've got to defend the the resource usage uh to to to take it forward to take it past gleaming idea that I had while I was on the running trail this morning.
(10:16) Uh which you get a new idea every freaking morning if you're doing this, you know, it's just and 90% of them suck when they actually come in, but when they're on the running trail, they're all great, you know, before they see the light of day in the actual business climate.
(10:34) So anyway, I'm convinced that, you know, everything Ramsay has done has been on about 10% of our ideas. 90% of them when they made the light of day sucked. And some of them really sucked bad, but you know, you you don't know that sometimes till you get in there swinging. So all that to say, it's it's bubbling up. Uh occasionally we'll have something that doesn't have a home.
(10:54) Uh and we have a special projects wind team that is an incubator. It's a shark tank, if you will, for for ideas that don't they can jump in. And so you've got some senior leaders representing several of the disciplines that sit in there. And special projects works on two things.
(11:13) Broke things broke, you know, some an area's got the flu and it's, you know, we're not meeting budget, we're not hitting our revenue goals, and it's a, you know, it's a goodsized thing and it's problem. I sit in that. I sit in that work team. That's one of the things I sit on. It's one of the groups of work groups I sit in because I'm entrepreneurial and I love working on broken things.
(11:31) And we'll take a baby thing in there that doesn't have a home, an orphan, and um you know, put put it in niku in there and let's get this thing let's get it nourished. Let's see if we can get it moving and um see if see if it can survive. If we can get the thing to where it's past beta and it's actually the business is actually got some social proof, uh, we'll make it a new profit center or we'll drop it into one of the existing ones that even though the idea didn't come from them, uh, and go, look, this fits over here the best, so we're going to drop it with you guys and um, and you know, we'll take send a leader when we send it over there. We'll put a new leader on it and
(12:06) let and then start to staff it out. So when you put a new leader on it that so that was the who does new that was kind of the heart. Um so when you put a new leader on is that do you typically pull like a junior like if you VP is head of a division you pull somebody who's kind of one of their right hand they get the opportunity from a career pathing perspective that they can run this new thing or like how do you think through through bringing those leaders in are you mostly yeah I would just love to know how do you think through through that part?
(12:32) probably 80% maybe even 90% of the time it's in house and we're constantly working on bench depth around here. And so we've got somebody waiting in the wings and it might be them that that birthed the new idea and brought it into special projects, you know, and so they may have been rocking the baby for a little while and then they just get to they get to grow it on up, right? They get to give the orphan a home and they they become the new mom, daddy of the of the thing.
(13:03) So um uh yeah that's how I like to do it because if the person if it was born in their heart they will they will fight all the enemies internally and externally for the survival of their baby. I mean and they'll champion the cause baby. I like the pe I like champions. uh you know they paint their face blue and uh you know and you know ride a horse with a big sword coming through the thing to get every and and you sometimes you got to sit them.
(13:32) I I would a lot rather try to take somebody like that and pull them back and polish them a little bit than trying to light wet wood. Light wet wood. That's a great analogy. Well, when you when you start these new divisions, and I think I I I want to the reason I'm hitting on this is because I think it if you asked a hundred entrepreneurs, what's the number one thing that uh you wish you could do? It would probably be more new stuff.
(13:56) And so, this feels like a very a very relevant thing to talk about. And I think that happens at all levels because, you know, in the beginning, uh you're just barely figuring out what's going on. And so, you're just trying and seeing what sticks. Later, you have more resources. So, you think you can do more. Um, but oftentimes you also distract the team.
(14:14) They feel whiplash and then sometimes the core business starts to falter because everyone's looking at the new shiny toy rather than the main game. We started it with one area and it was tech because tech was exploding uh 20 years ago. And so, you know, we had the web department, you know, that's what it was called.
(14:38) That's how lame it was, right? And so, but these so these these, you know, these programmers and tech people are all sitting in a room. Uh, but they're getting paid off the P&L of that profit center. So, the guy or gal running that profit center wants some freaking accountability, but instead we had them just over here. They were on their own little island and we had to break that up. And that's when we busted it.
(14:57) About this about 20 years ago, we went to this matrix approach. Well, this is a is a great segue. Um, so with each of these VPs, I would imagine these are, you know, among the most valuable people in the business, right? Because they're they're fundamentally running a business unit. Yeah. They got literally a P&L and they literally get paid off the bottom.
(15:16) They get build for portions of the overhead, the rent for the building in their area as if they were a, you know, a standalone business, so to speak. So, we're job costing if you want to use accounting terms. And um, and then they get paid off that bottom line. So if they if their bottom line goes zoom zoom, their personal income goes zoom zoom.
(15:34) I I I want them to be very wealthy because that means they made me a lot of money and so I love it and uh yeah and we want everybody in the building doing that. Also though we have a high respect for the seauite we have a high respect for that senior marketer uh and the the value that they bring not just the entrepreneur running the the vice president's role or again senior VP sitting some of those and even some uh executives uh some of our operating board members sit in some of those seats but um but that's how you know it all rolls up under a business unit and then the seuite I imagine gets kind of compensated from the company overall. Yeah, because what I've got is uh our
(16:11) operating board is half seauite and half business units. And so what we've got to have is we've got to have this u uh we have to have an accounting system and a budgeting system that serves the business units and notifies the rest of us if the business how the business units performing. And so uh it's not really optional. You've got to do that.
(16:33) And and if if you're a a bootstrapped entrepreneur that came out of sales or marketing, you might not know how to do all that accounting stuff. And so I got to roll some accounting support up under you to make sure that that you get to keep doing the stuff you're good at, but we also actually want to count the beans, make sure, you know, pay taxes. Yeah.
(16:58) This stay open, all the good stuff. I get I get this question a lot, so I'm curious your take on it. um equity packages, stock shares, anything like that or is it all pure based on bottom line profit? Is that the kind of the performance compensation uh component of the the leadership that you bring in for either business units or seauite? You know, when we first uh started sharing off the bottom line with people, that's when we had to answer the equity question was are we going to um let someone have stock? Okay.
(17:28) So, our endgame, we decided a long time ago, endgame is not going public. Endgame is perpetual operation generationally. And so, it's what Simon Senate calls the infinite game. Okay? We So, we don't have an exit to an IPO planned. Uh we're not doing that. We've decided distinctly 25 years ago, not doing that.
(17:55) We don't have a sale of uh of any kind to a VC or anything else. We don't have a liquidity moment anywhere on the horizon at all. If you do, it would change what you're doing maybe. Okay? Because if you're going to take the thing public and you give some people some equity, that's not a big deal. Okay? But if you're running at infinite like that and um about the only thing that we're 100 about the only person in the building we're 100% sure is still going to be here is me everybody else could might someday want to leave or have to leave. And so uh uh and and I didn't want that. I
(18:32) wanted everybody to stay forever cuz I love our people and I I you know there some of my best friends are my leaders here that I mean we do stuff socially with our wives and husbands and everything else. I love them. I've got high respect for them uh as human beings, as their spiritual character, everything.
(18:50) But still, I have over over all these years found that sometimes people leave and I cry a little, but I cry a lot if they took stock with them. And so, uh we don't have any equity positions at all. And uh you you make unbelievably good money when you move into leadership and you're paid off the bottom line here.
(19:09) Like lights out scary good money. uh like nobody nobody does what we do. We're so freaking generous because these are the people that are running the thing. They're the people that grew this. They deserve to get paid like they're a partner. And so I I have zero greed over that. But you don't own anything. I own 100%. Well, I don't own the stock anymore. My It's in my kids' names.
(19:34) uh uh from a state and planning standpoint, but uh and they're, you know, my grown kids, my the the the nextgen uh of uh grown Ramsy's. So, but uh aside, I mean, I've got 1% to be clear, but the only voting stock, but the uh but anyway, no, there's no equity. There's no equity anywhere except Ramsy's. That's it. Oh, I love that.
(19:56) Um I'd say Leila and I have a similar perspective on acquisition.com in that it's kind of our forever business. you know, we plan on just continuing to own it, continuing to operate it. You know, we will we'll enter we kind of see it as the goose versus the eggs.
(20:12) Um, at least how how we think through it, which is probably like we use a different analogy, but similar you have 14 profit centers. Those are the eggs and then the goose. It's like why would we get rid of acquisition.com? It's it's the the mothership to to use your language. So, it brings so that brings up uh two two different points that are probably somewhat related.
(20:30) So one is is a 100% of Ramsey in person are anybody is anyone remote? No, we all work at work. Yeah. So there's no like like you don't have like exceptions where like you know vid uh like editors or for for for social media or you know maybe some of the coaches or something like that could be remote. Everybody moves to um to Tennessee. Yes. And the with the exception of the occasional temporary thing. Yeah. Of course.
(20:58) obvious but in terms of the actual structure and the reason is very simple. Um our quality of communication in-person communication quality goes way up and so things are actually communicated. We all know this. Anyone that's got walking around sense knows that 85% of communication is uh is body language and tone and p not words.
(21:26) and and so um uh when you are sitting beside someone you can feel the spirit of what's going on and you are getting a whole different quality level of quality of communication. What that does is it increases two things. It increases trust and it increases productivity and and then those two things increase speed because organizations move at the speed of trust and and so when I am not sure because I'm using a text uh or I'm even a zoom uh and I'm not really sure what she meant or he meant. I can't really tell if they were being passive aggressive, but if you're sitting with them, you
(22:05) know, right? If you're sitting with them, you know. And I I can go just go walk around the building and I can feel the air. I can feel it in the air. I've been leading a long time. And I teach my leaders to do this. There's an old book a thousand years ago, In Search of Excellence.
(22:22) It was the Good to Great book before Good to Great, before Jim Collins did it. It was back in '92. And um you know that they studied great companies. And one of the things the managers did, they did management by walking around. Just walk the floor of the plant if you're in manufacturing. and feel the vibe of the workers. Feel the speed. Feel the energy in the air. Look for u chaos.
(22:45) Look for uh dirt and filth versus organization. Um and I walk through, I smell food inside of our building. No, that's not cool. We have a cafeteria. You don't eat at your desk. Leave your salmon somewhere else. Nobody wants to smell that crap, right? And so, you know, they're just little stuff, but you just walk through and you can kind of tell uh, you know, I walk past people, they're they're on a they're on a co a coaching call on a Zoom call with somebody. I just pop my head in there, you know, smile, wave, and disrupt the whole call and then leave, spread hate
(23:15) and dissension, right? So, that kind of thing creates a cultural uh uh level of trust and productivity. Uh, I call them driveby communications. I can just drive. I can walk past and I read through the weekly reports and uh uh so and so's mother's got cancer and I can walk past just touch them on the shoulder and say, "Hey man, I'm praying for your mom. Sorry about that.
(23:43) " Third, you know, 68 second interaction that does not occur if they're remote. I think you might like this. Um, I think it was either Uber or Airbnb. Someone can correct me in the comments, but uh the they did a research study because I think they were trying to prove or at least definitively know whether in person versus remote, you know, which one is better, etc.
(24:02) And they they found a an it depends answer which is and I talk about this because obviously we're in person, we have a big big headquarters here in Vegas. um that especially especially for the first third of someone's career. So basically like call it 18 to 35 is where those people get a disproportionate upside for being in person because of all of the unstructured learning that occurs that's not on your quote career path.
(24:34) You know like if you're sitting right next to marketing and you're in sales, you know, you you overhear, you know, what what's going on in terms of the organic stuff. you over hear what's going on in the paid side. You start learning a little bit more about funnel, you know, about landing page and conversion rates and things like that.
(24:47) And then all of a sudden when you are on a sales call, you know, with a business owner or whomever, and they bring something of that up, you're like, "Oh, I actually know something about that." Because but if you were in an only Zoom environment, uh, you lose out on all of that. And so I'm a big advocate and because I obviously have a um a big, you know, percentage of the audience that I have that's in their early 20s um beginning their career. I would encourage you all to to work in person. I really mean that.
(25:11) I did read one I did read one piece of research that you get more uh uh chances at promotion. Oh yeah. In person than if you're sitting at home and you're only on the calls commensurate to the task assigned to you. And so and you know we can add to this even further. you've been here. Uh we've got this massive fabulous cafeteria uh restaurant at Ramsey.
(25:34) So, um and on top of that, we drop several million dollars a year into that to subsidize the food cost. So, you can eat here for about half of what you can drive down the road and, you know, get a fast food burger or whatever.
(25:54) Uh why do we do that? Because when people eat together, oh, that adds a whole another level. When you break bread with someone else, it changes everything. And so what happens is people that don't work together end up eating together and what you're talking about occurs. They learn from each other. They uh you know, they talk about stuff they're working on.
(26:13) Uh sometimes they just talk about personal stuff, but then the next time an issue comes up, they trust that person because they've actually developed a bit of a relationship with them. I look over and our tech guys and we got a bunch of techies in here, a bunch of programmers and stuff and they're all over there huddled around some table playing some weird board game thing that I don't even know how it works.
(26:31) Um and and you know that only programmers would play, right? And um or some weird card game, Dungeons and Dragons type stuff or whatever. I don't know. And and but they're having a blast and they're playing together and eating together and that changes the whole vibe of the deal.
(26:51) I will tell you that if you just are only concerned about a task and that's it, a simple tactical do this thing, that's fine for remote. But our stuff is always 100% of the time we want more out of the interaction than the simple task being accomplished. And that's why we've stood firm on this. And we've lost some people to that.
(27:13) They want to go work and have work life balance which or whatever they call it. and so that they can work from home. Uh but what that actually means is I'm not planning to work eight hours, right? Because if you're working eight hours at home, you're not talking and interacting with your family. So I don't know how you added hours to your family unless you're cheating the company.
(27:31) And so uh uh I don't I don't I don't understand it. But I'm not mad about it. It's just why we've decided to do it. And then but some people some people jet and that we've lost some good people over that. And uh so we've had a lot of discussions about it here, but we're pretty firm on that. There's a couple dovetales that I that I'll hit on that.
(27:48) So one is you talked earlier about bench depth, and I would imagine that one of the best ways to build the bench depth is having more people crossunctionally learning in person from other leaders at cafeteria, at the water, break area, um and what have you. You also spoke about trust. Uh the speed of the company is based on the speed of trust. And I would um I would I would I I 100% agree.
(28:09) And I think that translates into faster decision-m. And so I'm I'm a big I'm a big believer in the speed of decisions is the speed of the company, which can only be based on the trust that people have. If you have to double check every single thing, then all of a sudden approval process has to get put in place and then bureaucracy kills everything.
(28:27) Well, and and it it it interferes with delegation. The the essence of delegation is trust. And so when I can let something bubble up from the bottom, it's because I trust the people that they're that the idea is going to get filtered and vetted.
(28:45) It's we're not going to go drop a million dollars on a bad idea, you know, and so it's not I I trust the competency of the people. That's a that's a form of delegation. And I think you spoke to two things there. You spoke to both competence and intention, right? So intention, you know, like are they good at their job and do they do they mean mean well? Which I think it kind of ladders up to on brand versus off-brand.
(29:06) Is this a Ramsay thing to do? Is this the Ramsay way? Um, so if just because I think everybody loves The Good Story, what's the most what's the biggest goof up you've had uh in 35 years on something that was off brand for Ramsay that you were like, "Man, I can't believe we did that or I like and and and what what then what did you do about it afterwards?" Because I'm sure every business owner's had a big goof up and been like, "Shoot, that was bad.
(29:32) " You know, I I I I don't know if it was off-brand, but um I think one of the most expensive things we ever did uh was that we got about uh several millions of dollars into uh the uh building of a debit card. Okay. A Ramsey debit card that it wasn't off brand. It was right on brand. But um but but what this it was one of those things we didn't know what we didn't know banking regulations and and so forth.
(30:03) So we're looking for a click and mortar bank to park the thing in cuz it's we're not in the banking business. We're certainly not going to open a bank. Good lord no. Um that would be there's no way. But but there there's tremendous um revenue potential in the transaction fees. And so we're looking at the Ramsey debit card and it's something that we could promote.
(30:24) We could brand it. Had a nice little gazelle on it. Had a nice little R on it. That kind of stuff. And um we screwed around that. That thing was born in Special Projects Committee. It was a baby. It was orphan. And we put it we brought it that's an deal. We brought in an outside guy that knew the banking world and he's still with us today. Works in another area.
(30:42) He was brilliant guy. Really smart. And um I don't I never want to lose the guy, but uh we got down into that thing and it uh you know, of course it's has to survive through the pandemic. Uh and and that that slowed everything down, shut everything down for a while and had to back put it on the shelf. Get it off the shelf and dust it off. Okay, get it going again.
(31:06) Get the beta picked back up. Get the alpha picked up first and get the beta picked up. And I think we were at about 10,000 people in beta. Okay. and um the uh the the the um outside fraud uh bots started hitting the thing and we thought that the bank had the u the software to catch all of that.
(31:36) Uh and then we're looking at okay, we're responsible for these overdrafts that are being created. we have to cover them um in our contract. And real quickly, the thing starts going sideways. And I'm like, man, I'm so many millions into this thing. I really don't want to kill this thing. But I we're looking at the risk and the upside. And and we just we blew it up. We killed it. And I still got one of those little debit cards in my folder.
(31:59) I carry it to remind me of how stupid I was. We weren't stupid really. We we did everything correctly, but what we we were ignorant. We did not know what we didn't know about what our exposures were. And once those exposures became um evident, we just had to go, "Oh, this is way scary. I can't breathe and we're not doing this." Like, our losses could be infinite. Huh. Yeah. Exactly.
(32:26) Exactly. I'm like, "Yeah, if I write, you know, if we lose the several million we've got in it, that's that pales in comparison to how bad this could be if we don't stop. So, we're going to stop now." And uh odd thing, the bank that we were working with uh later went sideways and was in the news and blew up.
(32:45) And so, I think I think uh God protected us by letting us exit the thing early because we would have gotten the opportunity to exit anyway or we would had to move the whole project to another bank when that bank blew up. But it was a click-and-mortar bank thing. I feel like a lot of people have had that same like, "This is such a good idea on paper.
(33:02) Why is this not working the way I wanted to?" Exactly. And it was working. The customer loved it. We would have been able to track and for the customer, track their expenses, and give them report and feedback. The data we could have reverse furnished back to the customer was going to be Oh, man. It was going to be beautiful. Oh, yeah. I mean, I see it.
(33:21) It's a I mean, it it's compelling. and and the you know and we had written so many of the APIs and so much of the tie-ins you know to get all that stuff we're running it on every dollar in the beta but uh yeah it got it got hairy let me let me pivot from something uh from from the super tactical of that to zooming all the way out so a lot of entrepreneurs myself included you know you start to you know build build a lot of wealth and then there's also the biggest percentage of your wealth sits inside of the enterprise that you run, right? And so how do you think
(33:57) about family office like you know you start you start getting this money right that comes into the business or comes out of the business excuse me. Um do you have any kind of mental framework that you work through in terms of percentage reallocation to new you know new investments uh within within the overarching structure.
(34:21) Uh, and where where this gets more tactical for me to you is Leila and I have run almost everything inside of acquisition.com. And that means like we own buildings, we own apartment complexes, all that. It still sits in acquisition.com. Obviously, there's entity structures and things like that, but in terms of the team that helps run it because, you know, acquisition.
(34:41) com primarily is an investment, you know, it started as a family office, but it just it spun up these other uh profit centers to use your language. um over time. And so I I'm I'm curious, have you do you do you completely separate church and state to to to use that language in terms of you know Ramsey personal versus Yeah.
(35:04) Can you just walk me through how you think through that? No, we we have uh done all other investing outside of Ramsey Solutions uh and in separate legal entities as well for for uh riskmanagement purposes. That simple. and also for estate planning purposes. Uh so for instance, the campus that you were on is um it's probably a $600 million asset roughly, something like that. Um maybe you own in cash. Yeah.
(35:29) Yeah. I just wanted the audience to I just wanted the audience to know. Sorry. Go ahead. So, when we when we bought the dirt to start laying the first bricks on the first thing on it, uh that was a $10 million purchase and it's the largest purchase I'd ever done in my life when I bought the dirt and I was freaking out and I'm like now I got to build something too.
(35:52) You know, now that I bought the largest thing, now I got to do something even bigger and it's like we're going to cash. So, we cash flow everything as you said. Um, but we immediately drop that into the children's trust so that I'm not the owner and uh and so you avoid um any you you don't avoid capital gains on the or I'm sorry estate tax on the basis of what you put in there, but you do own all the growth. And so while we've owned this property, it's doubled in value.
(36:18) Um, and so there's hundreds of millions of dollars that have now avoided uh estate tax by that being over there. Plus, if someone wants to sue Ramsay, which apparently is a hobby for some people, and uh then they uh you know, that's not on the plate because Ramsay does not own the campus.
(36:41) Ramsay is a uh Ramsey Solutions is a tenant uh of the Children's Trust. And then, you know, same thing if we we own a bunch of other real estate because I love real estate like you do. and uh um I just buy that and drop it into an LLC. And if it's anything over uh 10 million, I drop it into a sing single standalone LLC so that all risk associated with that property is contained within that property.
(37:03) and uh from a latig from a uh litigation standpoint uh or or maybe anything else. But um and also then that gives us some other estate planning things we can do uh with uh because partial interest LLC's can be with one of the kids can be uh or a kid entity. Uh a trust can be greatly uh reduced in uh appraisal value.
(37:29) uh and you can slip more and more of that into the estate plan and not have taxes on it. So we've been doing a bunch of that for 20 years and playing with all that stuff and that so the reason was estate taxes and risk management is the only reason it's there philosophically it's all in one lump.
(37:48) Well, that's exact and that that really teases to the the heart of it because for sure the entity structure from a risk protection perspective then you know uh from from a succession planning and avoiding estate taxes later that 100% makes sense. I was curious about the actual team. So like would the same legal team that does Ramsay stuff do some of these other deals? I asked because this is me selfishly asking because my my you know my my estate attorneys, you know, who manage all of that stuff. Um and I have our M&A attorneys that handle a lot of our our our deal flow. Um a lot of times we
(38:19) share I share the same resources, same same people um for things that are quote personal versus acquisition.com. Um and I was curious if you had any like basically if you had had a mistake from that that I don't know about, I would love to know. No, I I have used uh I've done both. Uh so all accounting for the whole thing is in-house. Ramsey accounting team does it. Okay.
(38:46) Taxes are have been outsourced forever anyway. Estate planning has been outsourced forever. Uh nuanced litigation has been outsourced forever. Uh, but a little thing if I need a if I need somebody to look over a lease or uh verify that we wrote the LOI up if we're doing a I bought a piece of property this week and uh you know with or I've got it on LOI. I don't have it contracted.
(39:11) So, you know, will will my real estate team, which does not work for Ramsey, run walk down the hall, they do sit here, but they don't work technically for Ramsey. Do they walk down the hall and run it past the general coun somebody at the general counsel on the legal team? Probably. Yeah.
(39:31) Uh, but minor stuff, but pretty quickly if anything gets like if you're if we're reszoning a piece of property, my legal team here doesn't know how to do that. I've got that's going to be an outsource guy. I'm going to bring in a zoning attorney that knows what the flip they're doing and knows everybody at the county that can walk it through cuz my guys would be stumbling around not knowing what they're doing down there.
(39:43) General counsel would be. Man, this that was super helpful for those of you who are, you know, further along in the path like some of this stuff that we're talking about with asset protection and entity structure. Although it's something that you don't I didn't I wasn't like I don't wake up every day and be like man I can't wait to learn about asset protection but it's you know I did not anticipate when I was 64 years old that I would own zero. I don't even own my cars. I don't own anything. Everything is in an LLC and my wife holds the
(40:14) LLC's. I actually am a very poor individual. You know, we built this, again, we referred to it several times, but we we love our campus and I'm proud of this property. We've done a good job with it, but when we're sitting on the interstate, six sto two six-story buildings with big huge Ramsay Solutions signs on them. And I thought, cuz I'm a real estate guy, I thought, okay, traffic count, that's branding.
(40:38) you know, people going up the interstate, they see Ramsay and they stop in and watch the show here because it's on the glass and it's all this customer interaction and and it was like we're, you know, the stuff we're teaching is working for us. So, it's proof text for the customer, right? And so, it's branding and it's all positive, positive, positive.
(41:00) I had no idea that when you did something like build this building and put it on the interstate that you basically should have put right under the sign the words sue me or bull Yeah, nice bullseye. Right. bullseye. A little bullseye. Yeah. Because I think people, some people got from that that this is now a a a uh a target-rich environment.
(41:18) Uh and then we've had to spend we've had to spend some money convincing them otherwise. Um because I don't I don't do well with this kind of stuff. I really don't negotiate. I'm going to pound you into dirt. And I've got some of them that are six and seven years now that I've been that have been sitting in court and I'm not going to quit.
(41:37) I'm going to destroy them because I cannot stand the thievery that that represents. It's I can't stand a thief. I love this so much. Um I I could I could talk probably another hour on this, but I I'm going to pivot for the sake of the audience.
(41:55) Um can you walk me through the six stages of scaling that you uh that you talk about in the in your book? Well, we we came up with what we're looking for because the bestselling book we've ever done and and the probably the most known thing in the entire Ramsey brand has been the baby steps. And that was the total money makeover book, 12 million copies now.
(42:14) And what we discovered from that teaching people the seven baby steps, this is what you do if you want to go from broke to wealthy is that when people have a clear path, it gives them hope and they don't have paralysis of the analysis and they don't have uh I if you have a clear map to get to Florida, your anxiety goes down if you're on the way to Florida, you know, and uh if you need a clear path.
(42:35) And so, uh, I didn't have a clear path running a business. And so, I'm kind of making it up as I go. And I got a lot of bumps and scars and bruises and, uh, and I went slower than I should have cuz I didn't know didn't know what the next step was. So, as we've coached ourselves now through 30 plus years and, uh, about 10,000 small businesses, we're observing that businesses go through five stages. It starts with a treadmill stage.
(43:00) When you're by yourself, you're a soloreneur. All revenue is based on you. All production is based on you. You don't even really own a business. You just own your job. Because if you don't work, nothing happens. And so you come home from work and you flop down on the couch. I would when I was at that stage. And Sharon say, "What'd you do today?" I don't know. But I did a lot of it and I'm exhausted.
(43:19) And so you just run run run run run run. And it's if it's to be, it's up to me. Is not a motto, but it is the motto. And so uh man, you get her done. Uh and and that is fun. It's invigorating. It's a fun time. You're still you still believe this business thing is going to be easy because you're naive at that stage.
(43:41) Uh but it's not sustainable. You don't meet 10year treadmill operators because you run out of breath. It's too hard. If you just own your own job, they end up closing going to work for somebody or they end up growing the business. So, what do you do to grow? Well, each of these stages, we figured out there's some things you do to level up. Uh, on that one, it's pretty simple. Time management.
(44:06) You got to do what our friend Burger at ETH says, and that is to work on the business, not just in the business. So, you've got to allocate blocks of time. You got to start blocking time and say, "All right, I got to work. I got to have I got to start thinking about something other than freaking Friday and pay, you know.
(44:22) " And then the second thing is I got to learn how to hire people and I got to bring on my first folks and uh and I can delegate to them so that someone is creating production and someone is creating revenue both that is not just me. So that if I'm hurt or I'm on vacation or uh one of my kids is sick and I need to tend to them, the whole thing doesn't stop. Uh and and when you do that, you level up. Uh you know, get your first hire.
(44:48) You start a little bit of baby delegation here. Uh and you get some good time management. You go to the trailblazer stage. Trailblazer is just chaotic. It's crazy. I mean, you're trying to herd cats. You got 10, 15 people and they're running in 16 directions. Nobody knows what nobody's doing, but we're doing a whole lot of it.
(45:07) And uh it it's uh communication is is really fun and there's a lot of passion and a lot of zeal. It's a good stage. I love the trailblazer stage. Uh but again, it's it's uh eventually it's so frenetic that eventually you you start to go, I really want to get a little bit more sophisticated than this cuz this is killing me.
(45:30) And and so how do you do that? Well, you start actually doing some planning, uh which is a whole new idea for the tactical person like me. Uh because when in doubt, I bust something in the nose, right? When in doubt, I'm going to run into the wall. Let's go do something. Not if I run into it enough times, it'll fall over. And I just start, you know, I got to stop being so tactical. I got to start thinking about long term.
(45:47) I got to start really developing my first layer of leadership inside my team. That takes you up to the uh Pathfinder stage or that's Pathfinder up to Trailblazer stage. Trailblazer stage is the middle stage of the five. I skipped one. And uh trailblazer stage is the middle stage of the fight. This is where you actually where I first started hearing about strategic thought.
(46:09) Um I'm so straight commission sales guy mentality tactical guy that when someone said we need strategic thought that sounded like corporate America. And I went no you just ought to go get your work done. And so, uh, but then I started hiring some guys and gals that had MBAs, and they started, I think 100% of the NBA programs teach strategic thought as a primary thing.
(46:32) And so, they start teaching me the value of strategic thought. They're like, "Look, you don't have to run into the wall. If you turn right and then turn left, you go around the wall. It's a lot less energy. You burn less calories." I'm like, "How'd you know that?" Well, I got above it. I had a 30,000 foot view.
(46:45) I wasn't just looking at the dayto-day, the moment to moment. Thank God it's Friday. Oh, God, it's Monday. And so we blow past that and we start actually doing strategic thought. So they my MBAs that I hired and other people taught me strategic thought. I didn't know it. Uh and I always laugh and say I taught them how to work.
(47:04) So uh but uh you know so we did that and then you moved to Pathfinder is the fifth and that's where it's really sweet man. You're bailing money now. Everything you got your systems in place, the processes in place, planning is in place. What revenue level is around? I'm sorry. Okay.
(47:22) What revenue levels would you say like treadmill is like 0 to a million? You know, we we tried to attribute it to that and we could do that with our journey, but we really couldn't. It changes from industry to industry. So, if I'm dealing with a guy that's uh got one heating and air truck and he's fixing, he's doing HVAC, you know, when he gets the 20 trucks and 70 employees, is he there? No, he could still be he wouldn't be treadmill, but that doesn't necessarily mean he's Pathfinder versus Trailblazer, right? So, uh because he could still be doing some of the dumb stuff three layers below what it looks like he
(47:53) should be doing. Um uh and that's that was me. That's what I did. Uh the last stage is what we spent a lot of our time on, which is where we are today, and that's the legacy stage where you talk a lot about succession. What's your endgame? How you going to hand off? Uh and you've got a bench depth.
(48:10) It's the ultimate bench depth is how you're going to replace yourself and uh and move to the family office mentality as you said and those kinds of things. So we walk you through those five stages, show you a clear path and then there's six drivers that drive those. I won't cover them all right now.
(48:28) Uh but you know it's uh uh you know it starts with personal growth. I am the problem and I'm the solution. I'm the thing holding the business back at every stage. And so I've got to get better at every stage, right? and uh uh purpose and people, the quality of your hires, the quality of your culture, the quality of the connectivity and the culture with the core values.
(48:50) All those things evolve as you go through the stages and um profit planning and then you just cycle back through those six drivers. We think we've been through the six drivers at Ramsey probably uh somewhere 10 to 15 times while we went through the five stages. uh because they they change as you uh you know it's like you read a great book and then four years later you read it again and you're a different person so you see different things and so you change as you go through but that clear path between the six drivers working to get through the five stages
(49:22) has set a bunch of our folks our clients our customers free so we decided to put it into a book and that's what building a business your love is. Well, Dave, I think we're close to close to time. Um, but I wanted to uh personally say thank you for the impact that I think you've made on millions of lives.
(49:46) I'm sure you hear it every day, but um I just I want to say thank you because I think sometimes uh when you're when you're at the top, you don't you don't hear it as much. And so, um I think it's it's it's real good stuff. Uh Well, thank you, brother. No, for real. Um, and uh, I think your heart is clear. I think people see what your intention behind it is. I mean, the man owns a $600 million campus in cash. He doesn't need your money.
(50:13) Um, it's nice, right? But, uh, but but he doesn't need it. And I think, um, I think it's really cool what you've done. I I would love to talk for another hour on even like going from personal finance to, you know, the the entrepreneurship brand. Um, but I know I know our our our time is limited.
(50:34) So, anyways, I want to say thank you again for for for coming on the game and I'm sure um my audience will will definitely definitely have a couple moments of uh PTSD here some of the stories we went over um and maybe hopefully avoid future PTSD by uh by taking a right and then a left. Very cool. Well, thank you for having me. Let's do it again. Yeah. No. Awesome. Thank you. Hey, if you enjoyed this conversation, this is actually a second uh long form conversation I've had with Dave.
(50:53) I had one, I think, two years ago. It's one of the top videos on the channel um that people seem to love.

(00:00) i was able to take home more in a year than the ceo of mcdonald's ikea ford motorola and yahoo combined as a kid in his 20s you guys want to hear something totally insane like completely out there wild i was able to take home more in a year than the ceo of mcdonald's ikea ford motorola and yahoo combined as a kid in his 20s that equated to 1.
(00:33) 2 million dollars per month in dividends for nearly the last half decade honestly no one is more surprised than i am about that and so me expressing this fact early on in this presentation in some people will create envy um it'll create anger in other people it'll create skepticism in most and confusion in old folks and hopefully it should inspire a select few and so if that was you then you are the people that i'm making this presentation for all right because i know exactly where you're at um because i have been
(01:07) there and i'll walk you through that so i was um i was talking at an event not that long ago and they had like levels to entrepreneurship and level seven was what they called me which was like the highest level which is kind of silly for me because i you'll see in a second why just a couple observations for everyone uh kind of like from outside looking in that may be valuable for you the first one is that everyone wants you to do well just not better than them and i think that's something that we can all recognize like some of you probably have experienced that
(01:38) other you will experience that if you have people rooting for you as an underdog sometimes that will change as you become more successful second accept that no one actually wants you to be rich except for you and so it's only going to be up to you to get there and the nice thing about success habits and wealth and business is that even if you don't deserve it in terms of your character etc if you still do the actions success does not care so success is colorblind success only cares about the work that is done third point that i've kind of found in
(02:11) my in my time money only solves money problems and then you were left with problems that money can't solve and so i know a lot of you um maybe maybe in a situation where like another you know more money feels like it will solve all your problems and i can tell you um it won't it'll just solve the ones that money can solve you'll realize which is uh point four is that you don't actually arrive ever uh you just enter a new club as the smallest member and so in the building that i live in it's almost exclusively eight nine and ten figure entrepreneurs
(02:41) so eight is ten million nine is 100 million and ten is a billion the guy who lives directly above me so literally the unit directly above me he actually owns the entire building and last year he did 3.8 billion in sales top line he took home 930 million dollars in income and so all that ends up happening is you you just get into a new new club as the smallest member there's just levels to the game and um i'll just leave you with this one last thing for those of you uh who see what i see on the internet world and the instagram flexes is that
(03:14) everyone talks about the laptop lifestyle having a business that spits out cash flow for you passive income blah blah blah this last year i did almost nothing work wise and our businesses generate a tremendous amount of cash flow i can tell you that i was very miserable i think that we need as a community to make work cool again because we kind of i see it all over the place especially in the entrepreneurial scene of demonizing the grind demonizing uh the hustle demonizing putting the hours in and saying that like if your business
(03:43) requires you that it's not a real business and i think that it's a load of bs because after having now exited the business uh multiple businesses now i can tell you it's not fun and i feel like what my my end result of this entire process for me is that i sought out freedom thinking that freedom and i didn't i had all my time when what i should have been pursuing was options and so if you enjoy the work you do you have arrived and so i can tell you right now and what i'm doing in 2022 is basically repositioning myself to get
(04:16) back 100 into the grind because i choose to and so anyways i wanted to just give you guys that because i know a lot of people are in different different places but i just wanted to share some things that i wish i had heard earlier on so who wants to hear about some stuff that can shortcut your path to material success so you can ponder the purpose of achieving it to begin with let's rock and roll all right so here's a quick framework that i have for making offers all right and the reason that we're going to focus on offers is because i believe that they are the fastest
(04:39) shortcut to material success in a business if i'm going to take a business over i'm going to take a a chunk of a business as an investor the first thing i'm going to do is look at the offer stack which is what are the things what are the sequence of offers we're going to make to the customers and prospects over their journey with the business now there's a lot of things that i cover in the book and i like i said earlier i could have covered every single one of them but instead i'm going to cover four main ones okay so these are the main things that i look at in the business
(05:04) and some of the issues that most business owners deal with one is the commodity problem so the goal is to de-commoditize it the second is making sure that we're actually targeting the right avatar who we think is going to be able to generate us the most long-term lifetime revenue all right the third is that we're going to make sure that we can charge a premium price for the the services and products that we sell and then fourth i'm going to cover the value equation all right because it's probably the biggest takeaway of the book and it is probably it is the concept that the book is based around
(05:29) all right scarcity urgency bonuses guarantees and naming are all things that will enhance the effectiveness of your offer um and i'll i'll tell you at the end some some easy resources that i can i can give you guys for those all right cool so we're gonna cover these four and so let's rock and roll so here's the problem right now if your ads are not converting well so clicks and opt-ins uh and or your sales team has trouble scaling so it means it takes too long to ramp up new new reps um then adjusting your offer is usually the issue it's usually the core problem that most people don't see all right and so
(06:01) to catch fish you need bait or an offer all right an offer is the starting port of providing them in exchange for their money that is what an offer is the reason i define it because it's good to have shared terminology an offer is going to be the number one driver of success of any campaign and i'll prove it to you in a second all right so what does it actually do it will allow you to sell in a vacuum or a category of one and forces customers to make a values-based decision instead of a price-based decision all right i'm gonna say that again it will force your customers if done successfully to make a
(06:34) values-based decision instead of a price based decision all right if someone makes a price-based decision means they hold up two things they say these are close enough i will make a decision based on the price and i will choose the cheaper one because these two are comparable if i make a values based decision i say this is the only thing i have nothing else i can compare it to and therefore i must accept the price that is being charged if i deem the value sufficient all right and so the goal is to decommoditize the offer that we are selling so that we can sell in a category of one
(07:06) and you can do this in any type of business that you have and so when you do this successfully you will increase the click-through rates on your offers on any platform you're doing whether it's cold outbound whether it's whether it's cold emails whether it's ads whether it's earned media whether it's to your list it doesn't matter where you're presenting the actual offer where those that offer sits with eyeballs wherever the eyeballs are if you make a decommodized offer that is value based rather than price driven you will increase the number of
(07:35) clicks that you get you'll increase the percentage of those clicks that convert and you'll increase the price at which those people purchase all right and so the simple translation for that for those who are or hopefully not bored out of your mind with the the concept or with the the marketing jargon is you get more leads you get more sales at higher prices and each of those multiply so if you get two extra leads 2x the conversion on those leads which is now a 4x and then you can increase your price by 2x that is an 8x increase
(08:06) in business that is why the offer is so important and so strong so i'm going to give you guys a real life example so the b2c weight loss right now is 99 a month if we're going to try and sell that all right for 99 a month i could not do it all right i failed miserably and so what i had to do when i was trying to i couldn't even give this away for free we transformed this offer into a free six week challenge by doing that what ended up happening is we changed a not even break-even offer to getting 30 to one returns 30-1 returns on our advertising all
(08:41) right the second example i want to give you i'm going to walk you through this one live together is a 1500 per month retainer offer uh one of our software companies that we sold called allen we dealt with a lot of brick-and-mortar agencies so people who would sell to chiropractors people who would sell to whatever right a lot of times they had an issue where they were getting commoditized right everyone had more or less the same offer and so they would say hey pay me every month and either you get results or you don't get results and the average agency who was
(09:09) there would get about point five to one return on their ad spend in their first 30 days so if they spend a thousand bucks they would make 500 on average and then the next month they would make a thousand and so forth right so they kind of broke even or lost a little in the front end and then they continued on the back end but what we were able to do is actually 22x the increase on average of the return on ad spend by simply changing the offer is that cool so right now if you could 22x the difference that
(09:34) you got and it did the same thing on the first one same thing on the second we're talking 20x 30x increase the return on ad spend would that be cool for you guys this is what happened before with the agency offer okay if you look here i have this chart and this is these are the actual numbers so when the guys were spending 10 dollars a month they reached 300 000 people the response rate was point zero zero zero one three right the number of appointments that booked was 40. the show rate was 75 appointments showed 30 you know closing percentage was 16 percent fullness was
(10:02) five price was a thousand bucks right so they'd make five thousand dollars off ten thousand these were the real numbers okay now when we introduced the new grand slam offer and the new offer that we gave them was pay us one time and we will work all of your leads for you and then you only pay us a gun after this first payment after someone shows up so only pay us when someone shows up after you sign up with us that's it you pay me once today i set everything up and then from that point going forward you never have to pay me again unless someone walks in your so check out the
(10:32) difference here so the advertising spend was equivalent between you know day one it says ten thousand ten thousand right impressions are the same because you know ads still cost the same amount but here's what's crazy two and a half x increase in response rate okay two and a half x but that's just step one now the changing result is we got from forty appointments to a hundred appointments for that ten thousand dollars of ad spend show rate was the same nothing changed there but now we have 75 people showed up rather than 30. and here's the next crazy part is that rather than closing 16 which is what
(11:03) they were doing with their commoditized offer at a lower price they were now closing 37 that's 2.3 x all right so more people were now buying more okay and so now i look at the difference in appointments closed you have five points closed versus 28 that's the result and here's what's even crazier they were closing sixteen percent of the thousand dollar price point but with the new offer the grand slam offer they were closing that at four times the price four times the price and so this was the end result for that same ten thousand dollars in ad spend went used to get
(11:35) them five clients at five thousand dollars a month and there's their five thousand dollars instead now they got 28 customers at 4 000 up front with a continuity program that had what i call an implied guarantee which i won't be able to get into today but basically any kind of performance offer that you can make is always an implied guarantee and so they would make a hundred and twelve thousand dollars simply by changing the offer which is a 22.
(11:59) 4x increase in cash collected upfront and that doesn't even include the lifetime value on the back end so you guys getting how powerful this is the difference between 0.5 and 11.2 they didn't even change the creative they just changed the offer they didn't change their funnels they didn't change their nurture sequences they changed any of that stuff they just changed what they were offering to the marketplace all right so right now can you think about in your business how if you could change that core thing how different the outcomes could be cool
(12:24) does everyone feel good about that in terms of understanding why this is so important and why the goal should to not be a commodity but actually sell in a category of one with an offer that's so good that people feel stupid saying no does that make sense that is why this is so important because otherwise you're gonna be price compared you're gonna you're gonna have lower conversions you're gonna have lower people show up you're gonna be able to only sell at low prices and you're ultimately just gonna be like everybody else and everybody else is broke so don't be like them so
(12:50) step number two is make sure that we find the right market all right so um this is kind of an interesting concept so i was at a uh and if the picture is blurry it's because my picture's actually blurry and i couldn't find a sharp one um so i went to this mastermind and in the room the the entire group was doing actually was 600 million in top line revenue so the highest guy was doing 250 million smallest guy was doing seven second smallest guy at the time was doing 35 all right and everybody else was in between and so i was sitting there and you know i was watching these guys do their
(13:23) presentations and i just i was left with this feeling where i was like are these guys making more money i was like i couldn't get it like i i was just like i was losing my mind trying to figure this out right and then it dawned on me after i was just like going on these blocks i was like they're just going after better markets that's all like that was it like it wasn't they were better at sales wasn't there better at marketing it wasn't like they were better at fulfillment i was like i know that we're nailing these
(13:45) things because when i was talking to them i didn't feel like they i lacked something it was just because they're going after the right market all right and so there you go it's almost like i made this presentation and that was the conclusion right they pick better markets and so what i want to do is because this is probably the number one question i get from people who are newer in the entrepreneurial space um and so here's the quick answer that i give most people if you're trying to figure out who you're going to serve right in your earlier on in your journey
(14:10) the way to pick that person is select the after you can provide the most values period so if you have like two or three people you're trying to decide between pick the guy you can provide the most value to that's the game number two the medium answer you want to make sure that you pick a single avatar so that you can productize your service and provide that value with low operational drag so let me give you an example so if you were to help one chiropractor do something right and generate leads or whatever then you would probably it would take you a lot of work to get that first guy going right
(14:40) but if you had 100 chiropractors your 100th chiropractor you probably have a lot of that stuff pre-built and pre-made right which means the amount of time and effort that it would take you to do that hundredth one is very low and on top of that through that hundred iterations you probably get better and better and better and so here's what happens the value that you provide actually increases and the cost to you actually decreases which means there's a big discrepancy between what that person is now getting and how much it costs you and we call that profit which is the
(15:08) point right and so the reason that we niche down when we're picking our markets is so that we can ultimately make more money and i don't have this uh example in the presentation but right now if i were to say hey guys i have a time management product right and uh if i if i was selling it and you go to barnes and nobles wherever you probably find it for 19 bucks right it's just time energy cool now if i were to say hey same product but now it's time management for sales people can you all of a sudden imagine that
(15:36) product being like a 99 product like oh okay i could imagine that being a 99 product all right now let's niche down a little further and say well of the people that could you know make the most money with time sales people definitely will will make more money with save time but what about outbound sales people we can make it even more specific and talk about their pain points etc and so we now make it an outbound sales rep time management course or book right and now this is probably like can you imagine that it's more probably more like a 500 product
(16:05) right so you're an outbound sales rep time management for outbound sales reps ah so what if we ditch down even further we said um outbound power tools and gardening sales reps time management all of a sudden this product goes from 500 to a 2000 product right now here's what's crazy about this the product remains virtually unchanged the only thing we did is we defined who the avatar was and we got narrower and narrower and narrower and so right now if you're thinking like the goal is that that prospect when they read your persuasion they read your copy the goal is not for them for
(16:44) for them to understand what you are writing the goal is for them to feel understood and that is the goal of great persuasion is that they feel understood that's the point and so the better we can articulate their problems and their reality to them the more they will be willing to purchase our product right and the more what we want them to feel is this is just for me and that's the goal right and so when we're picking that market right let's go back to our presentation this is my live speech answer which is what
(17:12) you guys are gonna get so i give you the quick answer which is provide go go pick the guy you can provide the most value to the medium answer is zero in on that niche and go really hard on it so that you can eventually productize your service and decrease your operational drag but here's my live speech answer all right so right now let's pretend we're in class right and there's a marketing professor that's um that's in front of the in front of in front of in front of us right and he says everybody here has
(17:36) now been gifted a hot dog stand and you are now forced to be in the hot dog stand business if you had one competitive advantage for your hot dog stand what would it be well tell you in this uh and i think this may actually be a real story so i'm not sure and so in the classroom all these people started starting shouting out all those things right you know better ingredients all my stuff right and after everyone died down he said the secret is that you want to starve and cry because when the football game lets out at three o'clock in the afternoon and everyone's starving and drunk
(18:06) you want to be the guy on the hot dog stand in the corner and you could have the worst hot dogs that were wildly overpriced and you would still sell out because when you have a starving crowd when the supply demand curve is in your favor it's hard to not make money and not make lots of it okay and so when we're looking at the market these are the four attributes that i look for when i'm looking to pursue a market okay you can write these down number one is i want them to not just desire but be in desperate need of the solution that i have all right i don't want people who
(18:36) are merely aroused i want people who are ravenous for a solution number two they must have the ability to purchase the product that i want at the price that i want to charge number three they must be easy to target if i can't target them i can't put my offer in front of them i'll ultimately not be able to reach them and sell and then number four i want to make sure that it's growing market all right so let's dive in so one of the sayings that i have in my sales team is the pain is the pitch right and like i said earlier the point of good writing is for the reader to understand the point of good persuasion
(19:07) is for the prospect to feel understood all right and so the goal here is that we want them to feel understood in the copy which is why niching down is so important right it's very difficult to make someone feel unique and singled out if you're talking to the masses right which is why it's so amazing that some of these mass market brands that do exist but most of them start small and then continue to scale in adjacent markets all right so we want to make sure that they're in desperate need number two so a friend of mine had a really good process for improving
(19:36) people's resumes so they could get more job interviews like he had a really dialed in process and he looked at these four things and he was like well this is i think this will absolutely crush and as you guys might even imagine is improving people's resumes so they can get more interviews it actually tanked and the reason was the p it was a growing market it was easy to find the unemployed people they were in desperate pain but they had no money right and so he had a really hard time charging the amount that he wanted for
(20:06) the service that he had right and so we got to make sure that whatever market you're zeroing in on they can afford you right and the thing is is there is a market out there that is in desperate need of a solution that you have find them right and they will pay you what you're worth life's too short to deal with people who don't appreciate you all right so number three this one is very tactical right but if you're trying to sell to you know rich doctors and your ads or your offers are only being displayed to nurses it's going to fall on deaf ears no
(20:36) matter how good the offer is no matter how good your funnels are no matter how good your sales team is and how great the product is you're just not reaching it right and so if your people are not aggregated somewhere in associations groups lists channels etc then just don't pick it because at the end of the day like business is hard enough on its own you might as well just make the things have as many tailwinds behind you as you possibly can because the thing is it's ultimately our choice right whatever business or marketplace we choose to get into it's our choice so i
(20:59) might as well pick one that's going to be easy to work on this is a little bit of a tactical point but this is just through my experience of dealing with lots of companies and having owned and scaled lots of companies it's much easier to deal with ones that are easy to target all right and so here's the fourth one this probably one of my favorite stories so warren buffett was doing an interview and he was talking about uh his best friend at columbia and so this is before he was warren buffett he was just a
(21:20) nerdy kid who liked finance at this point right and he said there was a young gentleman who he admired a lot who he thought was you know incredibly sharp tremendous work ethic high integrity um and he was somebody that he was proud to be associated with and ultimately when they graduated columbia they split they split ways right one person went into steel and then he obviously went into his partnership that eventually became a triathlon right and what's interesting is he said when he looks back on his life one of the most important lessons that happened is that that individual that
(21:50) man that friend of his he said he achieved some material success he said but nothing you know nothing really remarkable and he said that that lesson from that man was singular in its importance because what it taught him was it is far more important what boat you are in rather than how hard you row it is far more important what vote you are in rather than how hard you row and so a lot of you a lot of us as entrepreneurs we pick these huge challenges that and we're just rowing and growing and growing and trying to outpace the current that's going in the other direction and so there's an old vc saying uh that's a venture capital
(22:22) saying where it's great entrepreneur in bad market market wins bad entrepreneur in great market market wins right and so the point is is that the market matters more than anything when people actually are investing in businesses they actually look they're like what markets do i want to get exposed to because they know that even if we're mediocre and the market quadruples then we will quadruple even if we're average and so we might as well have the tailwind and i'll tell you one final story about this so a good friend of mine lloyd um really sharp
(22:52) entrepreneur he had a software company and uh it grew and then all of a sudden it started stagnating right and this is probably like six or seven years ago and he's and and for six or seven years i saw him really struggle right to grow the business and he was uh he was in the newspaper business right and so he was selling an ad product to newspapers and one time we're having dinner he's like dude i just don't know what's going on he's like you know my offer is a revshare model like it's they only get
(23:15) you know i only get paid if they get if they make money uh you know we've got a great outbound team we got a great sales team like i just i don't know what the problem is and i'm looking at him from across the table and i was like you serious he was like yeah i was like dude you're selling newspapers they're dying they're losing 25 per year compounding 25 newspapers about a business every year and they have for the last eight years and so that's how big the market was that's how much the market was shrinking annually compounded against
(23:40) him and this is probably of the four factors the biggest one that we have to look at when we're trying to pick our market is we might as well pick the right boat one that has a tide that's behind it with a heavy you know with a good wind going in the right direction because no matter what this is gonna be hard we might as well have one that's going in the right direction so those are the four components to picking the right market is that useful for you guys in terms of making sure that you're niching down picking people who have have pain
(24:03) have purchasing power are easy to find and are growing all right we want a market that is growing there's more of them every year right if you're getting into sil you know silver sneakers and retirement homes there are 10 000 people retiring a day and there's not nearly 10 000 units of retirement homes available right which means that that's probably going to be something that if you're in that space you're going to make a lot of money simply because of supply demand we'd rather have those chips stacked in
(24:26) our favor so i want to play a money game and this is not in the book so you guys pay attention to this one this is actually my favorite money games of all time okay so let's say that this is your business you can see the stats on the left there and hopefully it's clear for you um let's say that you have a business that gets 30 new clients a month let's say your churn meaning the percentage of customers that leave every month where active is 33 that means that the average customer stays for three months okay
(24:49) let's say the price of your service whatever it is a hundred dollars a month i'm using simple math here okay and so that would mean that your total number of clients that you can actively manage is 100 because every time you sign up 30 30 more leave and it's just around and around and it maintains at 100.
(25:04) all right well let's see your net margins are 20 so that would mean that your revenue is 10 000 dollars a month and your profit is 2 000 all right is everyone with me so far everyone good with this okay so let's say we rub we rub a magic water bottle right and this magic water bottle is a very specific niche water bottle because this niche water water bottle creates a niched genie okay and so the little niche genie comes out of the the the bottle and says i am a business jin you're like oh wow this guy's intense right he says i can double one aspect of your business and you must pick which of the three you
(25:37) wish me to double right so this is a very niche genie very particular about his about his wish selection but you know we're like hey i'll take a wish if i can get one right and so these are the three doors that he offers us okay choice number one is that he says i can double the number of new customers that you get every month so that 30 number turns to 60 new customers a month so i can do that that's option one option two i can double the price of your products or services and everything else stays the same that's option two
(26:06) say okay cool option three i can double the number of purchases per customer which means that people go from staying for three months to staying for six months okay so our turn gets cut in half which of the wishes would you wish for from our business genie fyi no matter what you're going to make more money because we got a business genius we kind of lucked out there right so if you were to double the number of new customers what would happen is everything would double so you'd go from 10 10 uh 10 000 a month to 20 a month
(26:35) your profit would go and your you know margin stays the same twenty percent so now you go from two thousand dollars a month to four thousand dollars a month in profit right twenty percent twenty thousand is four grand from twenty percent of ten thousand which is two grand all right so two grand goes to four grand you've now doubled your profit that was door number one door number three if you double the number of purchases you actually make a little bit more than twice the profit and here's why if you now are acquiring the same number of customers right but they're staying
(27:04) twice as long right on your on your recurring basis but the margin stays the same the difference is that the the cost of acquisition that you are now saving and not you'll get the same top-line revenue as as version one because that customer is now worth twice as much to you but you only have to spend this this amount of amount of money that it costs you to acquire that same 30.
(27:28) right so now you're you're still spending the same amount you're still acquiring 30 customers but now they're worth twice as much right and so by doing that you actually make a little bit more than twice the profit door one is the quote worst door the second runner-up or the first runner-up rather is doubling the number of purchases or decreasing turn in half and as you can imagine the best choice was choice two which is doubling the price of your product or service and here's why this is so crazy so i'm gonna walk you through this i'm gonna use my hands all right so if we were at ten thousand dollars a
(27:59) month with a 20 margin that means we're making two thousand now all of a sudden we doubled our price now we're at twenty thousand dollars a month but we changed nothing about what we were selling and providing which means that additional ten thousand dollars a month is pure profit which means we took our our profit from two thousand dollars a month to twelve thousand dollars a month which means we six x our income six x people talk about making 20 increases this is a 600 increase that my friends is the power of price which i wanted to
(28:36) use that story to introduce the pricing section which is why it's called charge what it's worth and right now many of you are under charging and ultimately under providing value because you are not charging the right amount of money all right so i'm going to give you a few frameworks that have served me well here so this one is called the price to value discrepancy the goal of any business is to have a price right what means it charge you uh you know a dollar for something i want you to get ten dollars worth of value right which is why you want to
(29:05) continue to do business because every time you give me a dollar if you get ten dollars of perceived value back you're going to want to do that trade as much you know as many times as you possibly can right right so many of you would probably pay more than you currently do for your netflix subscription you might pay 20 a month if they raised it and be okay with it they might pay 30 a month but the amount of access they leave there is the customer surplus all right so you can see there there's the value and the price and we always want to make
(29:27) sure that the price is below the value here's what happens with most businesses though most businesses charge their uh their price is actually above their value which is why they never get repeat customers because their product is right if you charge at your value someone will purchase they won't be negative they won't be positive they'll be moved right and so there's two real options here we can either increase that discrepancy by lowering our price so let's say our value is fixed right if we lower our price we have a discrepancy right the other option is to raise our value right and i can tell you one of those is
(30:00) going to make you a lot more money all right and i'm sure you already know which one it is which is increasing your value all right so this is what most people do and why you should charge so much that it hurts most business owners are not competing on price or value in fact they're not actually competing on anything at all their pricing process typically looks something like this and this may be some of your guys uh process you look at the marketplace you see without what everyone else is offering you take the
(30:24) average you go slightly below to remain competitive provide what the competition's offering with a little bit more and then end up with a value proposition of a little more for a little less it's a losing proposition you're not going to win that way and so what i want to do is introduce you to a very different framework to think through this all right and this is called the virtuous versus vicious cycle of price all right so this is what happens when you raise your prices all right so if you have any type of business where someone is required to
(30:54) do something right like onyx business right you guys are required to do something uh in order to succeed right we have to work now if we raise our prices this is what happens if you raise your price you increase the emotional investment of the person if you pay ten thousand dollars for a book versus a dollar for a book what do you think the likelihood is that you're going to read and finish the book if you pay 10 000 for very high so same book because we increased the price we increased the likely the person actually does it which if we're saying that we're trying to help people then it is
(31:26) ethically our prerogative to get them as emotionally invested as possible which means we should use one of the tools we have in our availability which is price the second is that if you buy a ten thousand dollar book versus a one dollar book what is your perceived value you will probably believe that the value is going to be far superior even if you change nothing i'll give you a quick story on this so right now uh they did a uh they did a research study with this where they had um tasters drink wine all right and so they
(31:54) gave them three wines they had a cheap wine a mid-tier wine and a high tier wine and they told them the price and everything um on the bottles and they had them try them and they had them rank them right and they could see the prices and so unsurprisingly they rank the best one the best the middle one the middle and the cheapest one the the worst right but here was what's crazy all three bottles had the exact same one so in a very real way price confers value to the product or service that you provide the reason the louis vuitton perch purse
(32:27) means more to you is partially because it is so expensive because it costs us so much time and effort to save the money to make the purchase it partially gets it it imprints that value onto the product so why not use that to our advantage and especially if we're going to make a lot more money doing it the third piece is that if someone's more emotionally invested and they perceive it as more valuable they're going to get better results if the price is higher right the demandingness of the customer and some of you guys will probably know this have you guys noticed that your cheapest customers are the worst people and the
(32:58) ones who pay you the most are the easiest to deal with right so when you raise your price you get more of the good people and fewer of the bad people right hey 50 a month you should be on call for me 24 hours a day you're like i don't know if i like you more than my wife and then finally and this is one of the key points that drives me uh drives the decision home for me is that the revenue for fulfillment per customer so if you triple you know the profit that you make on a sale then you have three times the amount of resources compared to your
(33:27) competitor to provide the value that you promised and ultimately in doing that you actually provide a better product and so that is why this is called a virtuous cycle because the more you increase price the more you increase their emotional investment the more you increase their perceived value of the product that you're giving the better results they get the less demanding they are which is the less operational drag you have to deal with and ultimately the better product that you'll be able to fill because you can keep your promises because you have profit left over all
(33:52) right and since people care less they they value it less they get worse results they're more demanding and you have even less resources left over to hire amazing people to give an amazing experience because there's so little profit left over right that would be a vicious cycle and then for you as the business owner so that was just from the client's perspective but for you as a business owner if you increase your price you increase your profit if you increase your price you increase your perceived value of self because who here would rather sell a hundred thousand dollar thing than a ten
(34:22) thousand it's a ten dollar thing right your own perceived value of what i am worth because of the value i know i can provide goes up all right and your perception of impact because i'll be honest with you like this can get hard but if you're not reminded constantly on a daily basis of the good you are doing the impact you're making the customers that you have that are seeing amazing results and success from whatever experience or transformation you provide if you don't have that you're going to be lost eventually
(34:47) you're going to burn out but if you do have that because you raised your price and you had profit to give and reinvest in the business and create amazing experiences then you'll feel better about it right your service level will go up and then finally and this is a key one if you have a sales team or if you're the sales team because of the emotional investment perceived value results uh and and the amount of extra profit you left over for the experience that you want to build you will be convicted that
(35:11) you can fulfill the promises that you make and the number one thing that converts prospects into customers is their belief that you will actually be able to help them and that belief starts with you because at the end of the day sales is a transfer of conviction from you to them through a bridge of trust right that is the point that is how it works and so if you don't have the conviction to start with even if you have the trust you'll never be able to transfer it because you don't actually have the conviction yourself and so when we think in this way we realize that
(35:39) raising our prices having increased profits is not only a good thing to do wise but also the ethical thing to do if you want to provide your customers with the true result that you promise them all right and so the goal here which i wrote here on the right is to be so much higher that a consumer thinks to themselves this is so much more expensive there must be something entirely different going on here and it forces them to pull you out of that commoditized category into a category one so they consider you on your own and
(36:05) your own merits of the offer itself and then make a values-based decision you guys digging this is this cool interesting sweet okay that was framework number three which is charging what it's worth i'm doing okay on time so i'll we're going in the into the fourth fourth fourth quarter okay which is the value equation and this is the concept that this book is really um centered around all right which is this value equation so i'll tell you a quick story so um i i did this uh i did this presentation um this was a two-day event that we held and this is actually a fulfillment event this is not a sales event um for for my
(36:39) company and so every single picture every single head that you see in this in this room paid 42 000 to be there and if you're keeping track from home and you're trying to count 42 000 start at the bottom and uh go to the left um there's 700 people all right it's a very big room it's very deep and um i remember the morning after i felt kind of hung over because i'd been speaking for two straight days and my dad called me up and he sounded really concerned so i like rolled out of bed and i was like hold on i like put a hoodie and start walking the hallway he was like hey i thought i thought that
(37:12) event that you had was only for your highest level kites and i was like yeah it was he's like no i mean the 42 000 people and i was like yeah it was he was like you had so many people there how could how could you have them all pay 42 000 to be there he's like do they do they know you're charging them that much money this is my dad right and i was like yeah they're aware that i'm charging i'm not magically siphoning money from their bank accounts like they're aware he's like i mean i hope what you're
(37:41) selling is worth it it's my father my own father sells me this right and so you know as much as that might have stung in the moment right um i realized that it was just a lack of understanding he didn't get how value worked and so i said well let me walk you through an example i said if right now because he he is a small business and i said hey if if i were able to increase your top line revenue by 239 000 a year would you pay me 42 grand he's like well it depends he said what would i have to do and i was like well uh you'd have to work 15 hours a week more to to do the system he was like
(38:20) okay he said how do i how like like do i know is it guaranteed like how do i know that that's what i'm gonna get and i was like that's just the average which means half of people do better than if you think you're above average then you do more than that he's like okay um and how long would it take for me to for me to get that result and i was like 11 months on average and he was like so it would take me 11 months that's the um and i was like yeah he's like yeah then i would pay 42 000 a year for that and i was like exactly and that's why they do
(38:56) too and so ultimately that is a premium price experience that i have lived through all right so that's 700 people at our highest level in our gym word business which is a licensing business we paid that as 28 million a year just from the highest level okay and the reason that that is important is that you can absolutely charge a very large amount of money if you can provide value for an access of that who here would pay you know forty thousand dollars to make an extra two hundred and forty thousand dollars on average would you guys do that if those are the terms yes and that is why these people do too and so if you want to
(39:27) raise your prices you must ultimately raise your value and the reason i part of the reason i wrote this book was because i hear the term value thrown around in the entrepreneurial community all day long provide value give value blah blah blah right but no one actually defines what the term means so this is my best effort at defining it so there's four variables to the value equation all right and so it's a fraction you've got a numerator and a denominator you guys can remember from grade school all right the numerators the top denominators the bottom all right and so if you're trying to make a
(39:56) bigger value or bigger number here the goal is to maximize the top and minimize the bottom right right so let's go through the first one the first one here is oops there we go dream outcome all right so the dream outcome is simply to demonstrate that the person must desperately desire what it is you are selling sometimes you guys are selling things that no one actually wants which is why no one buys the dream outcome doesn't even match right you're trying to sell you know automation to doctors or something like they don't care whatever right you don't actually want to be selling
(40:26) ice to eskimos because they're like i got plenty of ice and i don't value it right so as much as that saying is cute it's also not very business that right and so dream outcome is uh is number one and so the reason that this is so important is that if let's say for men for example most men get more status from having money than being you know thin right and so if i were to survey guys would you rather be a millionaire would you rather be thin most guys would choose millionaire right right and so that means that as a category overall
(40:55) men will value money more than their appearances which is why you know you see i won't even get into this more than that but hopefully you should understand that which is why the entire category of making making people make more money return on investment et cetera has higher price tags in general okay and that is what differentiates so if you have two different things one is helps guys make more money and the other one helps them lose weight the one that helps guys make more money in general will be priced higher now what happens if you have two products that are in the same category and one
(41:22) sells for fifty thousand and one sells for five dollars well the reason that you have the other uh that you have that price discrepancy due to two things in the same dream outcome is the other three variables right how come liposuction is fifty thousand dollars and a weight loss ebook is five bucks even though the dream outcome of weight loss is the same right right so that brings us to the second part of this equation all right which is perceive likelihood of achievement if i'm buying a five dollar e-book what do i really
(41:46) think my perceived likelihood is that i'm actually going to lose weight and look amazingly the guy in the company for five bucks for an e-book probably pretty low i might even not even read it right i might even have you check my email right now on the flip side if i pay 50 000 for liposuction what's the likelihood that i think it's actually gonna happen really freaking high right so let me give you a different version to illustrate this concept of how increasing the perceived likelihood of achievement actually increases the value you can charge all right this is the front end so let's say in that liposuction example you've got two
(42:15) doctors you can pick from you got a doctor who's fresh out of medical school he's never cut into a person you're gonna be his first patient and then the second doctor has done this procedure specifically for you ten thousand times for people just like you which guy are you gonna pick doctor two with ten thousand successful surgeries or doctor one with zero this guy not only that you would probably be way more willing to pay way more money for this guy even though the actual surgery dream outcome time under the knife would remain the same and that
(42:45) is because you we confer value based on our perception of the likelihood that the person is going to provide us the service that we have i had a different price point for my business when i had 100 testimonials versus 2 000. because that was the that was so very by the way if any of you guys ever have to raise your prices did you get better and better over time you said that was the 100 testimonial price because there was lower perceived likelihood of achievement now i've got 2 000. you know it's going to work the goal of the top
(43:09) is to increase it now most starter marketers only focus on the top half of the equation but when you look at the biggest businesses in the world they actually put all their attention on the bottom half which is actually where the competitive moat from operations occurs okay so the third variable here is time delay which is how long between when i purchase and when i get so if i were to click a button on the internet for a weight loss product and all of a sudden i pulled my shirt up and i had a six pack imagine how infinitely valuable that product would be and to give a different twist on the example imagine i
(43:39) had a marketing agency and i signed someone up and most are competing against saying oh it's going to take easier you're going to do all these things whereas the one that i just signed up for the agency that i created as soon as i sign the paper my phone rings the qualified appointment and say hey i just saw your ad imagine the difference in value the difference there even though that might have happened 60 days later in the second example is time delay fast beats free the easiest way to provide value in any marketplace is look
(44:07) what everyone else is doing and do it in half the time all right so that is an element and the third component of value the goal is to decrease it and then finally we have effort and sacrifice right and effort and sacrifice are two sides at the same point effort is things that you must now start doing that you do not want to do that you must do as a result of a purchase sacrifice are things that you now must stop doing that you like doing that you can no longer do as a result of a purchase so for example
(44:37) i'll use weight loss because we've been keeping it consistent um if if i have to start waking up earlier in the morning then that is effort if i have to endure being sore that is effort if i have to give up drinks with the girls on saturdays and margarita mondays then those are sacrifices right and so most and i like putting both of those in there because when you're writing copy it's good to think about both sides because you have to give up sleeping in but you have to start waking up early right so it just gives you two sides to think about it from a messaging
(45:07) perspective and so when we're creating a product the ultimately valuable product would be a product that i didn't have to do anything for that the moment i clicked purchase i knew it was going to work and it happened immediately and so think about the difference between let's say meditation right meditation is the dream outcome is to feel relaxed right perceive likely of achievement meh time delay might take us months of meditation actually get that kind of subjective well-being boost right and then the effort and sacrifice is i'm gonna have to sit cross-legged my legs go numb i have to feel like an
(45:37) idiot because i'm not staying focused um i have to do this for 30 minutes every single day to eventually yield the results which is why you know there's not a lot of huge meditation distances right flip side what if i gave you a pill called xanax you feel chill your perceived likelihood is 100 the time delay is 15 minutes the effort sacrifices you swallow some water and that is why you have a multi-billion dollar product these are just the rules of value all right and they don't care about who you are or what you sell
(46:08) these values sorry these pillars to create value can apply so if you can think about your own business and the offers you have how can i increase the dream outcome how can i increase the perceived likelihood of achievement how can i decrease the time delay for my prospects and decrease what they have to do in order to be successful does that make sense is that cool is that a cool process for envisioning value you can apply that framework because once you see it you really can't unsee it um and that's how i think
(46:33) through any of the products that we're ultimately going to sell on any of the companies that we own all right and so five six seven eight nine so scarcity how to build that into your offers urgency scarcity is a function of units urgency is a function of time people usually lock them together but they are different bonuses are one of the things you're going to offer in excess of your of your core offer what are the guarantees we're going to offer to reverse the risk there's four you have unconditional
(46:56) conditional implied and anti-guarantees all right there's lots of stuff that i wish i could talk to you more about in terms of creating offer um and so what i want to do is give you guys something cool all right at acquisition.com i have this entire course outlined this book is 99 cents you don't have to opt in for it so i'm not trying to build my list or anything like that i just want you guys to have this stuff so you can just win them i just want more people to win all right so if you if you want a deep dive on each of these it comes with uh
(47:21) checklists and swipe files and downloads it's all free you don't have to give me anything um and then if you like the digital version uh the kindle's 99 cents so hopefully anywhere you are in the world um no matter what the economic climate is you can scrounge up 99 cents uh to get the you know to get all the stuff all right so um it's all free my gift to you like i said books there and if you like any of this type of stuff i have a youtube channel you can follow me on um and i have an instagram all right
(47:46) so if you if you like this type of stuff um i hope you do and uh as a side note if you are a company that's an e-learning or brick-and-mortar chain looking to scale we invest in companies that are at one to ten ish million that are trying to get to 10 to 50 million and beyond so that's kind of what we do so appreciate you guys thank you uh for your attention i hope you feel like you got a good return on it and have at least a few frameworks that you can apply to increase the effectiveness of your offers and ultimately get more people to
(48:10) opt in more people to convert by percentage at higher prices and ultimately provide far more value than anyone else in your marketplace

Transcript:
(00:00) hello everyone and welcome back to i guess my show so anyways um i guess you could call a show i don't know thoughts anyways so um i wanted to make something so this is called the offer is king um and that's because the offer is king so if you have a good enough offer you don't have to sell hard you don't have to have amazing copy or amazing creative um you just get a lot of people uh to sign up for your thing and so if you really think about your business most businesses should be founded on a core offer that is exceptional like an
(00:35) irresistible offer that is what's going to grow the business right and so what i want to walk you through is uh three really good offers uh the three components of those offers and then seven ways to ethically use free so um we're gonna cover a lot of ground really fast so um three of the greatest offers of all time were domino's offer some of you guys may remember this but it was delivered to your door in 30 minutes or it's free right that's an irresistible offer and they had pizza but because of that people wanted to make
(01:09) the order they didn't have to sell them on it they saw the offer and when they were hungry they were like shooting 30 minutes i can do that i can have pizza at my door and sometimes there's almost gamification it's almost a challenge that's like well if it's not in 30 minutes i get the pizza free so um it was something that was incredibly compelling it was one of the fundamental uh keys to their growth and why back in the days of yellow pages it was literally an entire section was pizza no other restaurant had a food category
(01:31) pizza everything else is just restaurants right so um anyway that was because of that one key irresistible offer all right the next was uh 10 cds for a penny right this was from i think it was sony way back in the day um now obviously it came with continuity and so that was kind of like the first trial offer um but that offer is one of the single greatest offers of all time for those who are old enough to remember it the third offer you may recognize which is when it absolutely has to get there by tomorrow morning and
(02:01) that is fedex so you'll notice the first two kind of have a pricing component fedex does not but it has a really high value component to it so i just want to break down these things into uh three pieces each offer has a component of believability right uh there's a famous marketer who said for every dollar you give me i'll give you a thousand dollars back he ran an ad in the paper and he got zero responses right that is a crazy offer but it's so good that it's not believable and literally no one responded to the ad right and so one of
(02:33) the things that makes offers believable is having a reason why that you would do this right if you're like hey i'm you know i'm dropping all my prices by half off because i uh all my inventory's gonna go bad people believe that they're like okay or like i'm overstocked and i gotta make room for you know new new inventory everything's half off people believe that it's a good reason why right so believability is number one number two is a high roi offer so basically um an offer that people deem valuable uh that can be communicated in
(03:03) a couple of words like guarantee you to your door in 30 under 30 minutes that was valuable for fedex it was at you know delivered to wherever you need to be or wherever it needs to go by next morning that is valuable right you can give offers but if people don't find it valuable it's not going to matter right and so um the third piece is kind of the business around it right and so that's kind of what i want to cover with uh free offers because you'll notice the penny offer is basically free uh the domino's pizza
(03:30) offer has a free component to it and so understanding how to use free as a marketer is probably in my opinion the single most valuable thing um that you can learn how to do it's learning how to build a better mousetrap and so um right now i'm working on a book called acquire and the subtext is building a better mousetrap which is just kind of like how to structure offers in a way that you can get tons of volume but also make money on the offers right and so this is uh you know my notes for the different ways that you can use free offers and i think
(04:01) i have seven on here so i'll walk you through them pretty quickly um to just kind of explain them so the benefit of having free offers is that you get the highest volume of leads right number one number two it's it's typically the lowest cost to acquire customers so that's number two and the third is that in my opinion um the key to having massive growth is to having a free offer right and especially something that's irresistible that can spread through word of mouth that other people can comprehend all right so first
(04:28) of the free offers is a free bribe offer right so this is where you offer a so when someone comes in you offer a program for free as a benefit for signing up right so frank kern way back in the day did a uh he had all of his courses that he'd ever made so high value offer probably twelve thousand dollars in value he said i'll give you all of the courses that i've ever made absolutely free if you sign up for my 397 a month continuity right my newsletter or whatever right so that's a free bribe offer so you can use the word free
(04:56) brings lots of attention has huge value in roi but it was a free with purchase right so that's kind of the idea is like if you buy this much smaller thing you get this huge value thing for free and it's also a really nice price anchor okay so that's number one if you're doing a fitness thing it's like hey uh our six week challenge is a thousand dollars or you can just sign up to become a member and get our thousand dollar challenge for free and only become a member for 200 a month right that becomes a really compelling offer
(05:19) lots of people say yes and you get people straight into continuity all right the second is a limited free offer a limited free offer is let's say uh this is an a b close when someone walks in the door um obviously the vast majority of people are seeing this are gym owners so i'm going to just make it gym specific so if someone's coming in you say okay the free thing let's say you sign up for a 14 14-day or let's say a 28-day you come in for 28-day promotion uh the free thing uh has one you know you could say 28-day trial they
(05:45) come in it's one day a week of workouts you have no personalized nutrition no nutri no accountability coach right now during the sales process they'll have already said they're not motivated they need help blah blah blah and so then you upsell right as american as apple pie a 28-day challenge or 28-day intensive or whatever you want to call it accelerator where they uh they pay 199 or 299 or whatever for the enhanced version that has three workouts a week or unlimited workouts and personalized nutrition and an
(06:12) accountability coach and if they don't uh you know lose 10 pounds in the first 28 days you give them another 28 days free right so you have an upsell from an initial offer that makes it incredibly compelling right that's the point so they get all this volume for free but then you can still upsell three out of four people into a paid offer all right so that's how you use free and you can monetize it the third way of using free is a free trial plus penalty so this would be a down so it so these can be used in in conjunction with one another
(06:39) so if someone uh doesn't take that that you know the a b close that i just mentioned you could say awesome if you're going to stay then you have to put a card down because you want to be held accountable you have to work out this many times if you miss your workouts we're going to charge you for the missed workouts and you have to attend the you know a feedback session and a transformation picture session and a nutrition session right if you know show any of those it's 50 bucks and so they have a huge motivator to actually consume your
(07:03) product or service so the likely they convert on the backend is significantly higher right that's the point and so that way at least your trials become more qualified trials they're more invested and it's a really easy close to close someone on on a free trial if you can't close free trials then you have other issues okay um the fourth one is a free with deposit so this is a classic um the old six-week challenge that we ran for a very very very long time was probably the most popular fitness offer in the last decade
(07:30) um was a free six-week challenge obviously you always have to be compliant put stipulations for any types of things things on your advertisements um states differ etc but that's where if someone hits a goal they do an outcome they can get their money back or get it credited towards something so it's like it's free with a contingency so it's like you put x dollars down uh if you do x y and z you can either get it back or you can get it towards program whatever right that's kind of the pitch there so it's a free with deposit so free with
(07:59) stipulations all right the uh the the fifth uh way of doing free is free forever and this is a really compelling offer so this is where you have to really know how mousetrap works right so if you have multiple ways of monetizing a customer i could say for example i will train you for free for legitimate free like i will give you free training straight up your membership's true forever right as long as you just do the things that i tell you to do which may include buying supplements from us that's part of the program now um a good friend of mine
(08:29) owned a uh a chain of shadow franchise of uh weight loss clinics and they made only like five percent of their revenue on service and they made 95 of their revenue on supplements and so people would come in and they'd essentially give the service away for free uh but they were required to use the supplements as a part of it so that's a free 100 free but you're you're you're bolting on a different revenue stream so that's where you can offer multiple services and monetize a different service than the one you're
(08:59) giving away for free right um and especially if you have something that's uh high margin uh you can give that away for free if something's high margin and low value uh it's an easy thing that you can give away for free and then give something else away that's higher perceived value or make them buy something that's higher perceived value people tend to appreciate physical products more than they appreciate service or value service all right so that's kind of a free forever model which is really understanding that how you can monetize
(09:25) the second need the next thing they're gonna need after the first thing all right the sixth way is a a free giveaway uh this is a classic you know you run you run a uh uh a free giveaway let's say meals for a month right i'll pay for all your food for a month i'll pay for your whatever right um and so you get tons of people are gonna opt in for that and you say like well we you know we picked one person but if you still undo the program it's this and we'll give you a discount since you you know signed up or you know
(09:52) sign up to be a part of it so the thing is is when you have this people are still raising their hand to demonstrate they have a need for the service right and so if you have a giveaway that's perceived as high value and something that's related to the core offer that you have you instantly get tons of very cheap uh leads that are qualified for the service all right um a good friend of mine just started running a 25 000 transformation challenge and he's getting people to buy without even doing phone calls straight on the page because it's a 25
(10:22) 000 challenge and it's like 300 bucks to sign up online so people are seeing the huge giveaway and they're choosing to participate to have the have the have the chance to earn that right now obviously with giveaways and things like that you always have to make sure you're not gambling all that kind of stuff um but i'm just talking big high-level marketing all right um the next and probably last one of these seven um there's probably more these are just the ones i thought off the top of my head um is a free with
(10:50) free with commitment so not contingency but commitment so that's where you say uh your first 28 days or your first month is free as long as you commit to a nine-month contract or you commit to a whatever right and so when you do that you can still market free um you still you'd have to again put the contingencies in you want to be a compliant advertiser um but that way you can still give people free on the front end it makes the sale very easy puts a little bit more of the onus on the fulfillment but if you get the commitment which you
(11:18) should then you will be able to convert a very high percentage of people on the front end and typically at higher average contract values because they're not confirming that price on the front end uh it's more like perceived value on the back end and they're kind of sort of going to see how it goes right now that being said during the process you still need to sell the people even if you're not closing them so even if someone has their caller file and it's planning on rebuilding you still need to sell them on staying so just a big
(11:43) mistake that i see happen all the time is that when people give trials and things like that they're not actually they just sell the trial rather than selling the continuity selling someone on trial is just selling them on trying it you have to still sell them again even if they're on you know auto bill or whatever because the thing is is you know 30 percent of people who go through are going to immediately call you up and say oh no i didn't mean to let that go through and then you have chargebacks and all sorts of crap so you don't want
(12:05) that make sure they know they're going to get built and if it were me i'd probably only build the people that um i knew had been sold and had kind of at least verbally agreed to it we already have the contract but at least i know that they're in so um those are seven ways to make free offers to get lots of people in the door and make irresistible offers that will ultimately make you more money so learning how to monetize free is one of the biggest tools in your skill set in your toolbox and if you don't know how to do it you
(12:33) will be a significant disadvantage because your competitors will be and they can acquire more customers at a cheaper price than you do and if they can monetize them in the ways that i just outlined and you just know the metrics you know what percentage convert what percentage stay with the average ticket is and that's why knowing the math is so important but if you know those metrics then you can mark it with reckless abandon because you know what your ltv is um and you know that you can win based on those numbers so anyways i hope
(12:58) that was valuable for you uh the offer is absolutely king like if you get the offer right someone should be able to explain to someone else in like one sentence or two sentences what it is that the offer is if if you can't explain it like that then it is not clear enough to a prospect and if you get the offer right it will make you more money than you know what to do with all right so anyways uh i hope you guys have an amazing tuesday uh keep rocking and rolling and i'll catch you guys soon like and comment if you found this
(13:25) valuable so the gods of the internet will favor this and show it to more people all right keeping awesome catch you soon bye [Music] you

Transcript:
(00:00) burnout isn't real I just got off the phone with an eight figure plus CEO that was contemplating shutting down his entire business because he felt burnt out I'm going to release my side of the conversation with him so that I can show you the unlocks that we went through never done this before it's an incredibly powerful call you can unlock the unlimited motivation that I think he was able to tap into by the end of it you do not have mental illness you are not mentally unhealthy you do not have anything wrong with you
(00:27) if anything you have a lot of stuff right with you I think that you were really hard on yourself you're not only doing great you're doing extraordinary like you're doing very well and so whatever voices you have in your life internal or external that are telling you otherwise you need to stop listening to them I tweeted this morning and I was thinking about you do not listen to people whose dreams for your life are smaller than yours like parents friends only person who can know who knows how big you dream is you and if someone does
(01:00) have bigger dreams for you than you do then you should absolutely listen to them you know what I mean but if you don't then their advice is not valid that you don't share a common future and most advice should come from a shared common goal but most people give advice that serves them through your behavior which is another way it's called manipulation like the difference between help and manipulation is intention all we do when we communicate with anyone in general is to manipulate their behavior or change their behavior your goal is to
(01:29) change your behavior from this call I hope that this decreases your stress level because it reframes how you act in the company and in so doing allows you to go further because right now what feels unsustainable to you is unsustainable because you've defined it as unsustainable what happens is people start defining normal as good and that is the problem normal is normal normal is average and so we have to be different than average or different than normal or extraordinary in order to achieve an extraordinary outcome I want to say Andy
(02:02) Grove who said only the paranoid survive arguably one of the goat operators of the century who basically turned Intel around saying that only the paranoid survived and you hear like Steve Jobs like he was obsessive and he was he was difficult to deal with and so if we try and use standard is this guy normal the obvious answer is no and I hope not and so a lot of these character traits that I feel like I've heard you say about yourself that are set in a negative light said differently it's just they are not the same as other people
(02:36) well we can't hope to be have a different outcome from other people and then also hope to have the same behaviors viewpoints beliefs and skill sets right so like you gotta let your lungs adjust the altitude like you just went up like three rungs of success you know I mean from when you and I started talking whatever you're almost I think not even far it's been like six seven months and the business is triple what's interesting though is that you were in pain then and I would say that you're in equal pain now changing the
(03:08) circumstances or our conditions is not going to change how you feel we changed your conditions we actually massively improved them your feelings didn't change which means that the feelings are not valid doesn't mean they don't exist it just doesn't mean that we have to listen to them managing stress is a learned skill it doesn't come from changing conditions anything external does not influence how stressed you are the Judgment you have about the externals what influences how stressed you I don't like the term mindset you know I
(03:37) mean I hate it overall but in terms of like reframing and perspective shifts I think those are powerful to think through which is at the end of your life you will probably be equally satisfied and dissatisfied there will be things that you will wish you have you would have accomplished and there will be things that you will be proud that you had done the same as right now and so I think it's much more about figuring out how to separate your internal dialogue and feelings or at least respond to your feelings from the
(04:06) external you don't have to go through the fire the fire gives you evidence that you have the trait you can be impatient person but never been tested but the moment you've tested you have evidence that you're a patient so all it does is it gives us reinforcement that what we thought about ourselves all along was true what is the practice of doing this it's being able to separate and identify when you feel stressed step one I feel stressed I feel it and whatever your your triggers are for me I feel tight in my chest that's how I know
(04:36) that I start feeling stressed so when I feel that I think okay what is causing this what is the trigger that I have chosen to judge is good or bad what is the label that I'm ascribing to a situation if to peel back the liar and say what is it and then usually if you take it all the way down it means that you think you're going to die sales reload today which means sales are going to be low forever which means I'm going to have to fire everyone which means everyone's going to hate me I'm going to be isolated and alone and I'm
(05:01) going to die right just because you think it doesn't mean it's true thoughts are not true not all thoughts are true they're just thoughts famous feelings they're just they're literally just chemicals in your brain that are meant to keep you alive not to help you succeed when you feel stressed stop and be like ah I'm feeling emotion here I wonder what is causing this what am I labeling is bad do I need to change anything about this external condition probably not so do I think that law of large numbers is that if I have 365 days
(05:34) and I did the exact same thing there's going to be days that are in the bottom 10 and days that are in the top 10 with the exact same conditions like in terms of behaviors answer is yes and so I just described this as like oh this just might be one of those bottom 10 days and bottom 10 days happen every 10 days independent it's three a month it's almost every other you know every week ish and even of those 36 days you might even be in a bottom 10 day of those which is about a one percent day 3.
(06:02) 6 days a year [ __ ] horrible days but doesn't mean we need to change our Behavior probably not because our Behavior over a long trend line has tripled this business I feel for how much you beat yourself up because I too beat myself up and I do know what it's like to be miserable and I prefer not being miserable if I have approvals Victor Frankel's man search for meeting the man's in a [ __ ] Hall like in the Holocaust right he's like happyish so if he can be happy there then me making a [ __ ] out of money being young and healthy and married in
(06:32) the most developed country in the world do I really have any reason when covet hit the first three weeks a shitload of gyms closed my judgment of that was that they were people who wanted to have a reason that was socially acceptable for losing they were just waiting and then finally they had an out that they could be like covet and everybody like ah shucks not to say that external conditions don't affect things they do but the wave of gyms that I saw that really wanted to keep going but couldn't happen at like month nine when the second
(07:04) shutdown happened they ran out of cash they literally couldn't keep the doors open but the ones that happened in the beginning had lost the will to fight and so my goal for this call was to renew your will to fight because if we can separate your internal feelings from the external conditions that are around you you can be unbelievably successful now if it is uncomfortable of course it is it's expected to be that's why it's growing pains because if they were doing the same thing you were doing before then you would already have adapted to
(07:31) it which is why like I said you got to let your lungs adjust to the air it's thinner fewer people can stand it there's more but it does normalize just like when you look back at which you were running a million dollar business and you were stressed out of your mind then you're equally stressed out now but you would wish to have the problems you had with a million dollar business because you have adjusted your lungs are stronger now the things that you're doing are not even impossible they've been well documented and done
(07:58) for for decades by other companies so it's purely between your ears which is good news because it means all we have to do is reframe reality when you feel stress you do not need to behave stressfully because the plan is solid we just need our commitment to the plan to be just as solid I think you just have to be able to like create space if you think about one of those like Yeti mugs you know what I'm talking about you can have something hot on the inside and does it's not hard to hold it and it stays hot for a while the difference is
(08:31) that there's separation there's air between the outside and the inside it could be cold outside it'd be hot outside it's not going to change the temperature on the inside of the bottle it's like you need to be more like a Yeti right now if it gets colder your inside gets colder if it gets hotter the inside gets hotter but the more you can stay constant independent of the external conditions I feel stressed air that's because I have labeled something externally as hot but is it I have an external stressor do I need to feel stress space What If This
(09:00) Were good what if this is normal what if this is to be expected what if this is just the bottom 10 day it's just statistics of course I'm gonna have a bottom 10 today one out of ten days is about 10 percent and on the flip side something internally is off space it doesn't mean that I need to act that way so it's bi-directional if you delay the space between when you feel something and when you behave I promise you the behaviors that you will do after you had some space will be more aligned with your long-term goals
(09:26) to have the expectation that building a business that's going to set you up for the rest of your life is going to be easy is ridiculous the reason it is difficult for people is because you have to change how you view reality and you have that power you're super introspective you're very caring you have all the character traits of an excellent Studio the only thing that you suffer from is insecurity and second guessing less emotionally reactive more confident being able to continue to do without seeing the result of your doing
(09:50) if you embody those traits this company will grow beyond what I think you expect

How to Get Anyone to Do Anything You Want - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) Getting other people to do what you want is arguably the most important skill because if you have that one skill, it unlocks every other skill that every other person potentially has. The problem is other people don't always do what you want them to do. So, I'm going to share a five-step framework that I call the star system that you can use to influence other people.
(00:18) So, let's paint the scene. You say, "Hey, Kyle, I need you to make me that TPS report by Monday." Monday comes, Kyle doesn't have the TPS report. What do you do? I'm gonna make this really simple. Number one, did you know that I wanted you to get me that TPS report? And he might be like, "Oh, I thought we were just talking.
(00:36) " Now, you might hear that and think, "What a what an arrogant ass, right?" No, but like, let's be real for a second. Like, you probably don't follow up on a lot of stuff that you tell people to do. And what do you think people learn? If you don't follow up, it's like, "Oh, it probably wasn't that important to him.
(00:50) " And if you mention it two, three, four, five times, they're like, "Okay, this is something I actually have to do." The solution for the that problem is you write it. All right? And so one of the saying that we have at internal acquisition.com is if it isn't written, it never happened. If you just have a verbal conversation that exists IRL, just in the air, it doesn't ever matter because no one has proof of it, you don't have proof of it, they don't remember it, you remember it differently than them.
(01:16) This is why crystallizing those experiences so important because then you can point back to it. That way everyone's on the same page. Hey, I thought you said you want me to to send you the KPIs by Monday. It's like, "No, I said the TPS report." It's like, "Oh, well, I here's the KPIs." It's like, "But that's not what I asked for.
(01:29) " But how do we know? Maybe you did say KPI. Like, how many times have you said something, thought you said something different? Happens all the time. Number one, set the frame that these are the five reasons. And be like, "Hey, Kyle, you didn't do it." So, did you not know that I wanted you to do it? I didn't know.
(01:41) Then you're like, "Great, problem solved. I'm going to write it down next time. Here you go. I'm going to write down for you right now. And if you want, I'm going to memorialize this with an email and send it to you. That way, we have a timestamp and everything." But what if he's like, "Oh, no.
(01:53) I I knew that you wanted me to do it. It's like, oh, then did you not know what I wanted you to do? Because he did send me something. He just sent me the wrong thing. What's the that versus the what? Let me explain. Two things don't always mean the same things. You want to define what you're asking someone to do in terms of behavior or outcomes.
(02:12) So, if I wanted that TPS report right now, that's a really simple example. I would probably be like, when I say like, give me that, I was like, does that mean it's going to be printed out? Does that mean I want it printed out on my desk? Does that mean it's an email? Does that mean it's going to be like verbally given to me? Is it mean it's a presentation? In what format? And the thing is is like you might hear this and be like, "Oh, that sounds like such a pain.
(02:32) " But it's like it probably takes like two or three extra minutes for you to be like very clear. And then someone's going to take that two or three extra minutes and then save themselves like two or three extra hours. Clarity is high leverage work. I would say that if this is something that makes you uncomfortable, you need to break that habit for real.
(02:49) And let me explain why. How do you think AI works? Why do you think prompt engineering is such a high lever skill right now? Because the problem is no one even knows how to communicate. Got this thing of ultimate intelligence that can do things incredibly quickly. Has access to the world's information.
(03:04) And yet you can't get AI to do stuff for you. It's not because AI is dumb. It's because you know how to talk to AI. And if you can't talk to AI, you can't talk to a human. AI honestly has more context and more like tries to ways to figure out what you're trying to say because we communicate like monkeys. We're communicating with other monkeys.
(03:20) We got to be as crystal clear as humanly possible. Now, what's interesting is that the bigger the organization gets, the more this banana phone issue becomes a problem. This little five system, the star system, I run through it in my head all the time. Did they not know that I wanted them to do it? Did they not know what I wanted them to do, which I defined in terms of behaviors or outcomes? I need this thing on my desk by Monday printed out with that nice paper.
(03:43) or it's I need you to when someone says this, say this instead next time, not be less of a dick or stop harassing Courtney. It's like, well, what does harassing Courtney look like? He obviously isn't trying to harass Courtney. She might describe his behavior as harassing. He might describe his behavior as being cordial. So now what happens until you actually break down the behavior that they are both labeling differently, he's saying, "Hey, I said good morning to her.
(04:06) She's saying, "Hey, he's hitting on me." And you're like, "Well, what the hell? like what's going on? But until you figure out, wait, Courtney, when you say he's hitting on you, what exactly did he do? And she's like, well, he always like smiles at me and waves when he comes in. It's like, I don't think he's hitting on you, Courtney. I think he's being polite.
(04:23) On the flip side, it's like, what do you think hit, you know, hitting on you is? It's like, he always squeezes my ass when he walks by. It's like, well, that's aing problem. Let's be clear here, Mike. You shouldn't squeeze anybody's ass, let alone a girl. If we say he's hitting on me or be less creepy, no one wakes up and says I want to be creepy today.
(04:41) Creepy people act in ways that they don't think is creepy. And so by telling them to stop be creepy, they don't know what the that means. This might be one of the best explanations I've given of this. This is the problem. And this is why so many people behave in ways that they don't want to. Not because they don't want to do a good job, but because they don't know what doing a good job looks like because it hasn't been taught to them.
(04:56) You just got to tell them. Number one, they didn't know that they wanted to do it. If they did know that you're like, "Hey, you know, be nice to Courtney." He grabbed Courtney's ass rather than saying hello. He didn't know what to do. If he did know those two things, well, what's the third thing that could be the issue? They knew that I wanted the GPS report and they knew exactly what it was.
(05:15) Well, then why didn't it happen? Well, did they know how to do it? I told you to do that, but honestly, you asked me to, but I don't know how to put a TPS report together. And I'm like, wait, you didn't get that in onboarding? Honestly, no. Oh, okay. The solution to this is training. By the way, if you're like, man, and I like this drives me absolutely insane.
(05:35) I will hear people say, "These things aren't trainable." Everything is trainable. How do you think a baby learns how to do anything? How do you think humans learn things to begin with? It's just that some things take longer to train than others. And it's not even that a specific thing takes longer to train. It's just that that term has more skills underneath of it that ladder up to the larger thing.
(05:52) Meaning, if I say be kind, be kind has like 500 behaviors underneath of it. Yeah. It's harder to train aptitude than attitude because attitude is 500 behaviors. Aptitude might be 20. Yes, it is easier to train this than that, but it's not that something isn't trainable. And this is why specificity is so important.
(06:12) If you don't know how to do it, what part do you not know how to do? Do you not know how to turn on a computer? Do you not know how to turn on the internet? Do you not know how to send an email? Do you know how to use Excel? No, I know how to use all that stuff. Okay. Boom. Underneath that, do you not know where the data is that you need to extract this from? Do I know where the data is? Okay, got it.
(06:26) Then once you have the data, do you not know how to format it? Yeah, I don't know how to format it. Got it. So now instead of being like, "Oh, this guy's an idiot." It's just like he knew how to do eight of the nine steps. He just couldn't do the last step. So now I can say, "Cool. Let me show you how to format it." Done.
(06:40) And from here on out, when I ask you for a TPS report, that's what I'm looking for. Make sense? Yes. Now, let me give you a little pro tip. The higher the general skill and competence of the individual, the greater the expertise of the person in the domain, the more vague you can be with your directions.
(06:56) If someone comes to me and says, "Hey, I've got this product, this new marker, and it writes upside down and uh it's invisible ink. It's amazing. Alex, can you build a business around this?" I could just say yes because I have all the other skills it takes to build a business. Now, if you go to somebody who might be lesser skilled, you might have to say like, "Hey, can you make a marketing campaign around this?" Now, that person probably might not be able to like set up the entity structure in a tax efficient manner or be able to source the
(07:18) materials or be able to set up HR practices and all this other stuff, but like they could do the marketing campaign and you might be able to go to a good marketer and say, "Hey, can you run a good marketing page?" They say, "Sure." Now, if you go to a junior marketer, you'd be like, "Hey, can you run a marketing camp?" They'd be like, "Uh," it's like, "Okay, can you can you write some emails about this?" Right? We just keep chunking it down.
(07:36) The more skilled the person, the vagger the instructions can be. The less skilled the person, the more specific it has to be. For anything around trading, I talk about this at length, but basically document, demonstrate, duplicate, which means that I write it down. I do it in front of you, you do it in front of me, and then that's how it works.
(07:53) So, we create the list is me doing it. I observe myself or someone observes me doing it, puts the list down, I then do that list in front of the person, they do that list in front of me, and then we have a great day. With the TPS report, I say, "Hey, here are the steps for formatting. I'm going to write them down and then I'm going to do those steps in front of them and then I'm say, "Hey, let's do a second TPS report for next week. We can do it together.
(08:13) " They do it in front of me following the exact same steps I wrote down. They did it. Skill is transferred. And now, next time I ask for the TPS report, it'll be on time. If you want more about this trading stuff, inside of my leads book, I have a chapter on employees because you got to get them to do stuff for you.
(08:27) And inside I have my very very sexy besides how to attract employees methodology for on page 207 which I say how to get employees to get you leads but it's really how to get employees to do anything. So in step one document you make a checklist. Step two you demonstrate. You do it in front of them. Step three they duplicate.
(08:43) They do it in front of you. So I have this in more details on page 207 and 208 in the leads book. Enjoy that slight recap. First we figure out if they knew even that we wanted them to do it. Second we made sure that they knew what we wanted them to do. And the third it's like okay if they know those two then do they even know how to do it? Now if they do then did they know and this is a big one which happens all the time is did they know when I wanted it done by? And this sounds so silly but the reality is that the solution for this is
(09:13) deadlines. But it's not just deadlines. I'm going to give you a little 2011 version of this. If I say hey Kyle when can you get me the TPS reports by? He might say Monday. Now, a boss or leader or whatever who doesn't pay as much attention might just say, "Sure, that sounds good.
(09:30) " I like to push on this and I say, "Cool. How long do you think it will take you in order to get the TPS report done?" The actual work itself, not from now until you can deliver it, but how long will the work take? And usually someone will say something like, I don't know, probably like 2 hours. I'll be like, "Okay, well, it's Wednesday and it's 2:00.
(09:46) What are you doing between now and 4:00?" Now, if they have something that's more important, then they can be like, "Well, I was have to finish this thing by tomorrow, and then I've got this other thing that I'm going to do, and then that should take a full day, and then after that, I've got this thing, and then after that, I was planning on working on it over the weekend, so I could get it to you by Monday.
(10:02) " That I'd be like, "Okay, that makes sense." Now, if I look at all those other things, I might find out a couple things. Number one is maybe they don't have all these other things, in which case, do this now. And maybe they do have all these other things, but this thing is more important, in which case, do it now.
(10:16) By consistently asking when they can do it, how long it will take, and then what else they have going on allows you to have a way better idea of everyone else's workload in real time whenever you're asking people. And also, it just makes you way better boss in my opinion. Because if people are like, "Oh, I've got these." You're like, "Oh, no.
(10:32) Finish that. That's more important. Do that first. After this, we'll do my thing." This is kind of, I would say, a pervasive mindset that I have, but basically end of day is better than end of week. I want end of day to be my default. I want everyone's default in my life to be end of day. Think about how impactful this is.
(10:53) If you just assume whenever you ask for anything that it should be done by end of day, your organization will move at 7 times the speed. Some organizations like their default is end of month, end of week. An end of month organization will literally work at 130th the pace of an end of day organization.
(11:10) And you might think, oh my god, that's crazy. But do you think that some companies grow 30 times faster than others? Hell yeah, there are. And this is why the rich get richer and the poor get poor and there's the great divide between the doers and everyone else is because you really can outwork someone a thousand times. You really can.
(11:27) I can put out a thousand times more content than you. I really can. I can do that. We can work a thousand times faster than you. If it takes you 90 days to get something done and we get it done in two hours, we worked a thousand times faster than you. It's crazy. then it shouldn't be as big of a surprise that some people outear other people by a thousand times.
(11:41) I'm saying this because I'm trying to transfer this to you so that you can go get rich and do whatever you want because I'm gonna die and no one's going to go anyways long term. You might as well do something useful. And what's interesting about the star system is that it actually creates stars because if you tell somebody because you wrote it down, they know that they should do it.
(12:01) They understand the what that must be done accurately. they understand how to do the thing because you've done it with them before. They know how to do it your way and you've taught them. You've broken it down and then they'll be able to do it faster because they have absolute clarity on this point. And this is what starts to really move an organization.
(12:18) And so the other pro tip is that Jeff Bezos has an amazing one-pager that I tweeted about not that long ago and it was almost like the theme of the month for me, but he basically takes an excerpt from Richard Dawkins talking about biology that basically biology fights against its environment to stand out on a long enough time horizon.
(12:35) Once something dies, it basically merges with its environment. Like it becomes inseparable on a long enough time horizon. Like you just become dirt like literally you become the same thing. And the thing is is that it takes energy, a tremendous amount of energy to stand out, to be different. The world will try to pull you down.
(12:50) It will pull you into mediocrity. And the same thing happens within companies. Like the trend line is is regression towards the mean. That exists for a reason. You have to basically be willing to be so potent as a person that a drop of you into an ocean of clear water turns the entire clear water the same color as you. And fundamentally, that is what disseminating culture is from a leadership perspective.
(13:12) Like that is how great organizations are built. You have to hold the line. That means that this always happens. That means that like every time I'm on a meeting, if we're driving something, the key word is that we're driving it. Like I was actually talking to one of my leaders in the company earlier today and last week about this and I was like I want you to replace the word leader and I want you to switch it with driver in your mind.
(13:31) I was like because that's what I need. I need people who drive. You're not like you're a slave driver. The point is that you're you're driving things to get done. It's like hey where is that? How can we do it faster? What else can I pull off your plate? Right? Which I'm already I'm already giving you a little bit of of pre pre-framing for the fifth and maybe the most important part of the star, which is if someone knows that they need to do it, they know what they're supposed to do.
(13:54) They know how to do it. They know when it's Dubai, what's the last thing that could stop them? And I'm going to take motivation out of this and I'll tell you why. But the last thing that could stop them is circumstances. Now, what does that mean? It means something else. So if I asked you to do all that stuff, but you're like, "But dude, you asked me to do 10 other things.
(14:15) " So something else got in the way, an obstacle, something is blocking them. Speaking of obstacles, wouldn't it be amazing to know what obstacles are going to arise and by having a map, a magical map, dare I say, that could show you where all these obstacles will come up in the road. Well, I think we'd all want that. And I can't promise you that.
(14:34) But what I can do is tell you that we spent 200 plus hours actually analyzing all the companies over portfolio and basically breaking down the stages of growth into 10 stages by function. What does you know advertising look like at five person headcount versus 50% headcount? What does customer success look like or customer service look like when you're at your million dollar a year versus $10 million a year? What does sales or sales team look like when you're at a 100 employees versus five employees, right? Or even one employee. What does it look
(14:59) like? And so we broke down this entire process. It's absolutely free. You just put in your information. It'll tell you what stage you're at, what you're most likely to be struggling with, and what you can do to get through it. And if you want us to do this with you in person, and actually be like, "Okay, not only this is the problem, but like these are the solutions that work really, really well.
(15:18) " On the thank you page, book a call. Our team would love to talk to you if it's a fit for you guys to come out. We'd love to have you out here in Vegas. We run these workshops monthly and it's a lot of fun. People really like it. And more importantly, I think business owners get a huge amount of value from it. So, would love to meet you and back to the video.
(15:35) If I asked the best chef in the world, hey, can you make me an omelette? What an omelette is, you know how to make it, and I want you to make it for me right now. That guy might not do it. I'd be like, why didn't you make me an omelet? He might be like, I don't have any eggs. What do you want me to do? I don't have any eggs.
(15:50) And to the same degree, in a real business setting, it might be like, I don't have the RAM on my laptop to be able to process this size file and edit this thing on time. I have to get this other thing or I have to move to this other place, and that's going to take me time. Like there's some things that sometimes block people.
(16:02) Now the reason this is so important and this is the one I'll tell you right now. We go through the other four first because as soon as you mention this fifth one, everyone blames this one. Why? Because then it's not that people's egos are protected when they say, "Oh, I've got this other thing. I got this other work.
(16:15) I got this the I don't have eggs. Uh I don't have a Wi-Fi. I don't have blah blah blah." Now, this is where this is where the real leadership start comes comes in because this is where we say like, "Well, how hard would it have been for you to go get eggs? It's been 3 days. Like, how hard was it to get eggs?" Uh, well, uh, the Wi-Fi was slow.
(16:38) Was there any way to get faster Wi-Fi? This is where I start to make judgments on someone's abil on someone's agency, their ability to solve problems on their own. Because the thing that we always want to tease out long term is this. Why? Because that's the big motivation question. Because you'd assume, why didn't someone do it? Because they weren't motivated.
(17:01) Me asking someone, hey, were you not motivated to do this? No one's going to say yes to that. I'm just being real. Like, it's not going to happen, right? And so, we ask these other questions. The first four are what I would consider very standard business practices. But the here's the thing that's really clever with this is that by asking the first four, you basically give many opportunities for it to not be attack on the person.
(17:24) When you have the circumstances one, it also has realistic options where it might not be the person's fault. You might they might actually have too much stuff on their plate. But this is where the nuance comes in where you get to judge are those circumstances really the things that blocked you or are you actually not trying.
(17:40) Now, with the, "Hey, I just need an omelette by next Monday on my desk." And the person gets to you next Monday and says, "I didn't have any eggs." What are we talking about here? I mean, you're technically correct. If you have no eggs, you can't make an omelette. But do you lack the other skills of acquiring eggs? If you do, then we ask the larger question is, I know I could train you on how to get eggs, but is it worth the hassle? Like, I could train you on how to use a computer, but is it worth the time? This is why this is my fundamental belief
(18:10) about training in general, which is that everything is trainable. It's just not everything's worth training. Some things you expect to have someone have batteries included. And that's why there are requisites for jobs. That's why when you go to school, you have to take English 101 before you take English 2011. You get my point.
(18:24) The reason this is such a powerful frame, if someone comes back and says something like, "Well, I didn't think that was my job." Well, then they probably shouldn't do anything else in your company either. Because fundamentally, like what creates motivation? Motivation is the opposite of deprivation.
(18:41) But somebody who motivates other people is able to temporarily increase the value of an outcome. Fundamentally, that's what motivation is. And if you think about that, that's also what persuasion is. That's also what sales is. And so there's a lot of words that fundamentally mean the same thing. If I motivate you to buy, that's what a salesman does.
(18:58) If I motivate you to move, I motivate you to change your behavior. I for a short period of time change the relative value of an outcome, which then changes your behavior. So if I talk to you and talk about your weight and you haven't done anything about losing weight in a very long time, but in a short period of time I changed the relative value to you about what it might be like to lose weight or said differently the pain associated with losing weight.
(19:17) You might have always wanted to lose weight but didn't realize it could be easier, right? Or you might realize it's hard but I real I explain even more value like hey I don't know if you knew this but you'll live 10 years longer statistically if you lose 50 pounds. Then all of a sudden you said your daughter's about to get married.
(19:32) Don't you want to see your kids? Right? So my mother, side note, the only reason she lost weight was because the doctor told her that she wasn't going to see my grandkids. And that was the thing, tried to lose weight her whole life. 30 years tried to lose weight, couldn't do it. That was the line he was able to motivate her because that was the one thing for her.
(19:50) And so sometimes we have to think to ourselves, okay, what other things are we playing with that we can change the relative value of either decreasing the pain or decreasing the stick or increasing the carrot associated with getting the stick, but it still helps us tease out what's really going on. Fundamentally, we're just finding out the things that drive the person and trying to align them doing the thing with them getting what they want.
(20:11) Sometimes a salesperson will get tired of selling because it's the same conversation over and over again. They will say they'll get bored. But there's a huge amount of time between the first time you get bored in sales and when you're exceptional at sales. explaining that in and of itself to a salesperson is that your ability to maintain focus is itself a skill that needs to be developed in order for you to become world class, which is what you said you wanted.
(20:34) Sometimes just reframing their current struggle as a skill deficiency on their way to getting what they ultimately want is one of the most motivating things that you can do to help someone do the thing that they ultimately probably want to do too. They just haven't been motivated to. We knock out all of the peripheral things.
(20:51) They didn't know, you know, that we wanted. They didn't know what it was. They didn't know how to do it. They didn't know when we wanted to do it by. They had something that blocked them, but not really. And so, the main one is that we can get to the motivation. But if some people just fundamentally don't have enough motivation around this thing, sometimes they just don't need to work for you. And that's okay.
(21:06) There's tons of other companies that will that will employ mediocre people. It just doesn't have to be yours. If I can give you a fun one, because some of you guys have employed people that you know shouldn't be working for you. It's your it's your sister. It's your sister's husband. that's your cousin and you think to yourself, "But man, if I if I let them go, no one's going to hire them.
(21:23) " It's like, "Yeah, no one would hire them." And somehow you think it's a good idea that you continue to employ them. That feels max silly silly silly game, silly tier, S tier, S tier, silly. You're entering your silly arc, your silly era. Now, let me give you a little bonus reframe on this. If you're trying to look at your business as a business owner, right, from a strategic perspective, there's a lot of things that you could do, but we have to ask ourselves, what are the things that are the most important for us to do? By when
(21:54) would it be the most meaningful? Now, here's where it gets really interesting. You more often than not are going to have how issues. You're not going to know how to do it. And reframing the things that you know you need to do as questions that you don't know the answer to is so much more valuable than there's no one who can sell like me.
(22:19) I don't know how to get someone to sell like me. No one can market like I can. I don't know how to find someone who can market like I can. That's solvable. No one can is a statement that you can't do anything with. What I would really really push back on as my kind of like leaving thought that might be the most powerful thing of this video, be incredibly wary about the statements that you make that you believe are facts because those statements exist as truth only in your mind.
(22:46) Basically, your reality will be influenced by the laws that you choose to create and live by. If you want to bend your own reality, you have to be able to change the laws that exist in the matrix. It's like every system is built on rules. For some rules you can bend, others you can break. Wouldn't you want to build a business in a world that had the fewest rules possible? And then what's interesting to me is that the amount of conversations that I have with business owners who tell me rules that limit their business like, "Oh, we can't
(23:15) charge more than that." Why? Because no one else does. That sounds like a terrible reason. We can't pay people that much. Why? because it's not industry standard. Okay? Well, everybody in your industry makes no money, so why would we do what they're doing? The biggest gift that I can give you is that the vast majority of business owners are broke.
(23:39) Vast majority. The average business owner makes like $50,000 a year, right? I'm not saying that's broke. I want to be clear here. But for many people, the aspirations of being a business owner come with significantly higher goals than that reality. And if that's true, then the vast majority of business owners are wildly underperforming their aspirations.
(23:56) And a big part of that is because they model people like them. Most business owners look around. They see what everyone else is doing and say, "Oh, I'll do that and I'll do it a little bit better for a little bit less." But then every other person does that, too, until eventually you can't do any more for any less.
(24:13) Many of these businesses function as essentially nonprofit organizations where the person's barely above water selling a largely commoditized service at a commoditized price with no differentiation in the marketplace whatsoever. That's a game where if you choose to play like everyone else, you will lose.
(24:30) If everyone's doing something, it's a great reason not to do it. If anything, that like that alone would be that would be a reason not to do it. At least it's different. At least you have an angle. You have something that's different. Well, if everyone else is paying this, maybe if I pay more, I'll be able to suck up the top 10%.
(24:43) One of the things that people don't talk about in Henry Ford is Henry Ford paid people better than his competitors so that he could scoop up the entirety of the talent at his plants. He's the one who invented like the the manufacturing line. It's like, yeah, he did. He also paid people better than anyone else so that he could get the top talent.
(24:59) People thought of him as the guy who was just automating humans out. It's like, no, he just he actually ended up paying the best people to work for him, but he did something other people weren't. I would walk through this star system so that you can also think about your own business in that same frame.
(25:10) Why aren't you doing what you know you need to be doing? Do you not know that it needs to be done? Do you not know what it is? Do you don't know how to do it? You don't know when it would be meaningful that it's do being done by or do you have something that is blocking you? And do you have something that's blocking you? Is it more important than that thing? And if the answer is no, then stop doing it and do the thing instead.
(25:27) And if you're struggling to be motivated, maybe you need to look at yourself in the mirror. And I don't know what you'd say to yourself in the mirror, but like you could look at yourself and then eventually actually just do it because the look at yourself in the mirror is not going to change anything anyways, but you know, maybe you look good.
(25:39) Maybe that'll get you motivated. Use a star system next time have a hard conversation. Hey, real quick. Did you not know that I wanted you to do it? Did you not know what I wanted to do? Did you not know how to do it? Did you not to do it by Tuesday? Or was there something blocking you? There was something blocking you.
(25:53) Is it reasonable that it blocked you for that long? No. Okay, what's the issue? Or you know what? You're right. That did block you. do that first and then do this after. So, I want to read you a real exchange I had with an employee that wasn't performing the way I wanted him to. I said, "Hey, what are you doing today?" And then he gave me his little rundown and I said, "I asked because I haven't felt like I've seen a lot of production from you compared to what I think you're capable of.
(26:21) So, I'm curious whether it's not knowing what to do that I want you to do it, how to do it, or that something's preventing you, or if you're not motivated to do the above. And by framing it that way, um, it completely shifts the whole vibe of the conversation. And by adding the piece, and I think this is really key in terms of how it was framed, it's just like compared to what I believe you're capable of.
(26:48) So I'm basically weaving in a compliment saying, I think you're capable of more. I think your potential is significantly higher. Rather than saying, "Hey, you suck." I'm actually saying, "Hey, I think you're awesome and I think your performance, which is separate from you as a human being, is below what I believe you're capable of." So, what do we think the gap is? Is that you know that, how, what, when, or you're not something's blocking you or you're just not motivated.
(27:10) Help me, help you. And from this perspective, both of you are basically attacking the problem on the same side of the table, trying to figure out how to get the person to their potential, which both of you are aligned to have happen. And I'm telling you, it's just like imagine if I started that B and be like, "Hey man, you're subpar right now.
(27:27) You're you're under expectations." Like that sounds pretty bad. Everyone's going to be defensive. They're going to be thinking it's attack on their character. When is couldn't be further from the truth. And so having little frameworks like this have just like made life so much easier for getting people back to where you want them to be.
(27:42) With that, I'll see you in the next vid.

How I built a 1.2M follower audience in 6 months - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WrCt0R3FBFs

Transcript:
(00:00) what's up youtube yesterday over a thousand of you guys stayed on for an hour as we walked down a private event speech that i gave and i redid the speech just for instagram live and youtube for you guys and so we cover in the video is one the content creation model that we've used to grow over a million person audience over the last six months number one number two is how to position yourself in your messaging so you don't sound like a dick number three the concept behind giving away the good will and then selling the implementation because a lot of people feel like they have to keep their their best stuff hidden when the reality is
(00:30) you got to give it all away and then you'll always get so much more than you think you will number four was the three traits of ultra successful people that i've seen of all the people that i know who are worth a billion dollars or more they have these three traits in common and they're not exactly what i expected them to be the next one is the best way to scale a sales team because that was one of the questions i got the chat and i was really excited to talk about so i broke down the entire process of how we've scaled the next one is discussion around closing because now we went from
(00:52) the big team down to like how do i actually get people to say yes and the three frameworks that i use to walk someone across the finish line how i deal with failure and then finally i give you a little bit of a sneak peek on the next book all right so hope you enjoyed the live from yesterday and i'll see you on the inside i'll give you guys you guys want the um the skinny the scoop on what the presentation was if you guys can throw like some hearts or some thumbs up um okay cool so i'll give you the the kind of the overarching theme which was
(01:18) uh you know the first third of it i uh you know had to bring everyone up to speed who didn't know you know what our deal was um but in the last six months we've grown from like 180 000 person audience across like all channels to like 1.2 million now um in the last six months so it's been a lot of growth and i mean no one's experienced it more than me and so i'm very grateful so that's all you guys so thank you so much i'm really honored um and so kind of explain that and then the second portion was kind of like the tactics which is like what do we actually do to do that and i'll cover
(01:48) that in a second um and then the third part was my observations on like the things that worked big picture uh rather than like the blocking and tackling like hacks and things like that so let's go into kind of section two which is the tactics so there's kind of a five step process that we've been doing and uh caleb's been helping me out with this but basically we we test first and so this works because i used to email myself i don't know if you guys are like i am i used to email myself like brain dump like if i had an idea on a conversation or someone and i was like i didn't want to lose it
(02:18) i would just email to myself and this never ending thread of like me to me i don't know if you guys have that um and then i would go record content i'd look at that thing and then i would try and come up with my content ideas um but what i discovered was i could use twitter as my brain dump uh and take basically the same amount of time as i would to email myself with the contacts and whatnot but i could just do it on twitter and then what would happen is what used to be a private you know communication became a public thing so i
(02:43) was able to share something that otherwise wasn't being utilized and then the added benefit was twitter and like tech talk i would say are similar in that they're very fast testing like you can post 10 times a day and it doesn't like hurt your account whereas you know instagram people are like hey man i've seen enough of your stuff like one post a day is fine or whatever and so on there you can post plenty of times and then you get to see the engagement because both of those platforms are very like viral ready it's so easy to share and whatnot and so from those we see the
(03:09) best performing content and then that is what i then use to create to basically record videos off of so tweets turn into videos the threads turn into long videos the short tweets turn into shorts and then that becomes from there we record those things step three is we add call to actions to them which is something that we actually just recently started doing so you'll probably see it more on these videos and stuff in the future um but we just started doing it to my podcast if you haven't checked that if you are an audible person or an
(03:41) audio person uh the game podcast if you didn't know we have a podcast um has uh just grew from like 20 000 downloads a month to 400 000 downloads a month which is like insane so you guys are awesome i love you i'm glad that it's providing value um but the biggest thing that we did to get the growth was um literally just saying like hey if you like this like leave a review and share fred share a friend share our friend um and so so we start so we started doing that and then that's what everything just blew up
(04:10) which makes sense because like the book for example had a ton of virality to it because there was call to actions embedded within the book and so we just took like what we already know works within business we need to be reminded more than we need to be taught um and just applied it to something that i'm not as familiar with like i don't consider myself like a content creator like i you know we do business stuff and like we try and capture as much as we can and so um doing that uh we started interjecting in three places
(04:35) the beginning the middle and the end and if it's longer you can do a couple mid roles um and so what we did to operationalize that was we took like what are all the call to actions you would have right because you want to always be the same thing because some people get like banner blindness so it's like for me it's like you know hey check out the book it's 99 cents you can go download it you're like go check it out it's got five thousand five stars like people seem to like it uh you know hey leave a review that would be awesome uh you know tag me in this uh or send this
(05:00) to a friend so it'd be a share ask um hey if i have an event coming up which i don't but if i had an event coming up or if i was like hey i'm gonna do a workshop with like you know five entrepreneurs over you know a million bucks a year if i then i would just point people to something like that um if you had a lead magnet that would be one of those things and so you get the idea like whatever wherever you want to direct traffic that would be the call to action but here's the here's the shtick or here's the thing that the nuance that made it work is that rather than just doing one do like five for each one of them and
(05:28) then you've got like 30 of these that you can sprinkle in and then they seem really organic and because i i'm doing them really short they're only like you know five or ten seconds they don't they're not like these three minute long ads that everyone wants to kill themselves and just immediately skip skip skip skip shift until they get to the end of the ad right and so it's like little call to actions that are small enough that people actually hear them and different enough that you don't get like audioblindness
(05:50) and so that was uh step three step four was contextualized and so what i did in the presentation i showed this image you guys remember the meme that was like uh dolly parton was that she started it said like me on facebook me on tinder me on instagram you guys is this cool you guys like otherwise i'll just be ranting on my own okay cool do you guys want me to do more of this because caleb is we have a bet i'm i was like no one's going to show up and if someone showed up then i would lose the bet which is probably a very one-sided bet i should not have taken um
(06:19) but anyways so dolly parton uh there's tinder linkedin all that stuff right so that was the meme and so if you look and i have this visual if you look at a lot of my tweets a lot of them became tick tocks and then from that short tick tock i have a youtube shorts version and i have an instagram version and the thumbnail and the text are contextual to the platform and so you guys have probably seen people who like take a tick tock and then just like post it the same thing with the tic toc watermark on instagram or they take the same tick tock watermark and they put it
(06:51) on youtube shorts and they have the same like caption and whatnot around it and same thumbnail i think that people feel that like you didn't take that extra little bit and this could be me judging i don't know i'm just sharing what worked for us um and so we try to make it contextual to the platform and i think that's been helping um and so that's step four so test on twitter record shorts as short as long as longs add the call to actions to drive the action drive the action drive the actually looking for it drive the traffic wherever you want uh four is you
(07:19) um contextualizes the platform that you're distributing on and then step five is to actually distribute it and this is the this is the little little lesson that i learned and so i shared this i think on my youtube channel but i had a conversation with cardone i don't know six months ago and this is actually what was probably the big impetus excuse me catalyst for for this happening for me ramping up everything we said he said look at your instagram bro look at my instagram and i was like okay and he's like volume bro he's like i'm posting five times more than you are and he said look at your twitter look at
(07:47) my twitter look at your youtube look at my youtube and it was just such a stark contrast in terms of the amount of content that he was putting out compared to me and then it became really obvious and so what ended up happening is we went from posting seven times a week which was three youtube videos a week which three podcasts a week and one instagram post that was all i was doing and we went from seven times a week to 80 times a week across all platforms and so it was a 10x increase in content but
(08:12) here's what's interesting we didn't get a 10x increase in quantity we got a 10x increase in growth rate so the actual net result went from 180 000 which had taken us 12 months to build to getting to 1.2 million in six months of building and so the rate of growth 10x and so literally the input was equivalent to the output in terms of the the equivalence between those things so right now if you're thinking yourself man i would love to grow ten times faster so whatever your growth rate is on a new platform if you're thinking about it
(08:45) i could i will bet you i don't know if it'll be a dollar to dollar increase or a one to one increase but i'll bet you if you do more you won't get less and so that's you could take that promising back um and so uh when i started doing that that's when we saw this explosive growth and the thing is is i told this other story that hopefully you guys won't mind me sharing with you you guys cool just getting like some of the the nuggets from uh the event cool okay um i uh i had a mentor really early on when i had my gyms that told me to start putting flyers out right and so i put so
(09:16) i listened to him and i put flyers out and i waited a few weeks nothing happened i went back to lunch with him and i was like hey we did the flyers thing um it didn't work uh he was like what do you mean i was like well i mean one guy called me but he's because he said i dinged his car uh it was a mercedes and i just tried to talk to him really nicely and get him off the phone um and uh he's like what was your test size i was like what do you mean he was like well how many did you put out oh i put 300 up it's like 300
(09:42) well yeah it's like dude i don't even test for less than 5 000 flyers i was like oh well that explains it he's like and then we do 5000 a day once we have a winner it's like oh and so that wasn't even like 2x or 5x or 10x it was 20x and that was a per day not in total so if you did at the end of that month you would have put up a hundred and fifty thousand flyers and i put up three hundred and so i'm looking at the difference in results between this really successful business person to myself and i miss mistakenly thought that the issue was
(10:18) the strategy rather than the execution and so one of the number one things that i feel like i get in my dms all the time is like hey i've been doing the rule of 100 and you guys don't know what that is it's my like little stick for if you do 100 primary actions a day to promote your business or make your products and services known you will get more business which means if you do 100 cold calls you do 100 cold emails you do 100 dms whatever that is you do 100 of that primary action per day or if it's ad
(10:40) spend spend 100 a day um whatever it is or you do 100 a week if it's actual organic content i promise you you will have more business than you know what to deal with your problem will not be demand generation it will be satisfying the demand that you have to handle and so the thing is is that people hear that they hear the rule of 100 and i had a guy literally message me and said hey i've been doing the role 100.
(11:04) i just crossed 100 i started eight weeks ago i was like what do you mean you started eight weeks ago and you crossed a hundred it's like well i mean i've done a hundred you know reach outs over the last eight weeks i was like bro uh so 7 times 8 is 56 times 100 should have been 56 000 reach outs in that same period of time and hopefully you're catching the drift here that it's not these like 2x 3x increases in volume it's typically multiple orders of magnitude it's not 10x it might be 100x or 300x in the case of the flyers or 56 000 versus 100 in
(11:36) that same period of time and the issue is that most people dramatically underestimate how much effort is required to achieve goals that are dramatically above what the norm is experiencing and so it's like right now if you're getting normal results it's usually because you're putting out a normal level of output which is almost non-existent because everyone's so afraid of someone leaving a mean comment the amount of bean comments that i get is unworldly the amount that it influences me because i it is is love um and that's variety reason to get into uh it's mostly because i love you guys you guys are awesome so you guys have you guys bury
(12:07) those comments and so mosey nation you guys rock thank you again um and so that was section two of this thing you guys want to hear section three i can give you guys the stick okay so section three the consolidated version of this and i'm still like working on it so this was like the thing that made this uncomfortable for me because i think if i were to redo the entire presentation the entire presentation would have been section three altogether and it just would have started there and then gone down because everything that i shared with you although it's incredibly important
(12:36) probably lacks the one thing that i think matters most which is that most people are talking about [ __ ] that they have not done and the way that they talk about it makes people hate them let me explain so if i said for example let's say all right let me just let me try and paint it differently so let's see that you're you're on your newsfeed who here sees people shaking their finger and telling them what they should do on their newsfeed all the time right plenty of people now how how many times have you gotten you know seen the 18 year old relationship
(13:09) coach uh who's on your news feed trying to sell coaching for relationships right the dating expert that's 21 years old right have you guys seen this can i get like some hearts or some thumbs going if you guys have seen this right it's ridiculous why is it ridiculous because there's an unspoken question that must always be answered in my opinion which is why should i listen to you and so i think the common reason that people are not experiencing the growth and the brand and the authority that they wish to build is because they're trying they're putting their ladder against the wrong wall they're trying to
(13:44) build something that they do not have the authority to presume and so for example if you wanted to build a business brand right if you look at the biggest influencers in the business space so you look at andy frasella you look at garyvee you look at patrick but david if you're a youtuber you look at you look at uh you look at ed milette right you look at these guys a really important question is how many of them needed the social media following they have in order to make the money they make none and so they have the authority to talk about business because of the [ __ ] they have already done
(14:19) and so it's kind of like and i hear this all the time it's like man my content's so much better than that guys i can't believe people you know share that kind of stuff if elon musk tweets i'm on the the porcelain throne right now it'll get 500 000 shares and it's not because of the content it's because of the frame and the brand that is wrapped around that message it's because elon said it that made it important right and so the idea is it's very difficult to deliver theoretical knowledge on business without having the proof or the evidence to substantiate
(14:49) the theoretical knowledge you're claiming to have because it doesn't pass the litmus test of like why should i listen to you why should i listen to the ten thousand dollar a month business coach why wouldn't i listen to tom billy because we were like well i'm making the same stuff as tom and i'm like yeah you are i was like except you're missing the one thing where you build a billion dollar brand small thing that you're missing right where you've got the the stay-at-home wealth coach right that's talking about how you should dollar cost average into the stock market and being like dude i'm
(15:17) giving way better advice than warren buffett is and maybe maybe you're saying the exact same thing as warren buffett it's not fair that warren buffett gets all this media and you don't except for the fact that he's built a hundred billion dollars in net worth and made so many people wealthy through berkshire hathaway like there's just that that little itty bitty wrinkle that's missing and so if that sounds hopeless to you there is good news so the point is is that first identify if you're doing that if you are probably stop the second thing is that you change
(15:46) the way you speak all right and so changing the way you speak comes in terms of how you talk and what you're talking about so that what you're talking about the way to be unfucked with the ball so that people can't shoot you down who can't give you hate is by saying listen i don't know this is just what i did and this is what worked for me this time i hope it serves you versus this is what you need to do to get what i have or this is what you need to do in order to do x it's the difference between how to to how i
(16:21) so you start your message with how i built a 13 million dollar a month company not how you can build a 100 million dollar company it's minor but it's huge right it's kind of the difference it's almost like the difference of saying like hey you want to buy my [ __ ] versus hey do you know anybody wants to buy my stuff it's these tiny tiny little pivots in language that that have deep implications behind your intention of how you're speaking to them when you say you should or how to you're presuming a place of authority that you may not have earned whereas if you're always coming from the place of like i
(16:54) had oatmeal for breakfast right no one's gonna object with you on that you're like i had oil for breakfast but if you say you should have oatmeal for breakfast if you want to look like me how much more do you hate me now a lot and it's just a difference in language and so the idea is that we change the way we talk and what we talk about and so rather than talking about the general ideas of an industry which we probably don't have the authority to presume because we don't have the experience the depth of experience to
(17:21) make sure that our assumptions are valid across the sizes of business because you may make an assumption and you make a statement that works for a 10 000 a month business and then everyone else is like well i can think of a hundred ways that's wrong and then you look like an idiot but if you say hey this is how i've gotten to ten thousand a month i hope this is helpful for you no one's like [ __ ] that guy that's not how he got to ten thousand a month because they don't know they can't they can't they cannot challenge your experience and if you
(17:50) want to make a pivot on that you can say hey this is what i've been doing with john and jim and casey and sarah to help them with their skin care condition to help them with their home remodel to help them with their xyz so i hope it helped you out because this is the frame we made for them and they seemed to think it was useful so i just wanted to share with you guys if you if you speak from that perspective it's speaking from experience rather than theory and most people who are talking right now are just taking garyvee's
(18:15) content taking other people's content diluting it watering it down and then delivering it from a position of weakness because you don't have the brand and you don't have the authority you don't have the expertise or the experience real or imaginary to make these claims and so i think the heart of the issue is not i mean sure there's the blocking attacking of the volume and the distribution and contextualize the content all that kind of stuff right there's all of that and for sure you have to do the doing it has to gets done but the heart of it comes down to
(18:44) talking about things that you have the authority to speak over and it reminds me of a speech from morpheus from the matrix where he stands up and i think it's in the second or third i can't remember and he and he stands up and he says i stand here truthfully unafraid he said not because of the path that lies before me but because of the path that lies behind me because no one can question the things that you have already done no one can question the experience that you've amassed even if it's this big and the thing is is it's about it's about doing the first step and then talking
(19:13) about what you just did and what you just learned and then taking the next step and then talking about what you did when you just learned now the the maximized version of that is having a caleb behind the camera and and miked up all the time so we can capture that's gonna we're gonna be making more stuff for you guys on that because you guys asked for it and we're building the team to try and deliver that for you guys um but that takes time and it costs money to do that so i get that and so i think that just doing the doing and then
(19:37) talking about what you did is one of the simplest way to document the lessons learn how you progress and grow over time and as a total side note if you like want to check this out if you go on my podcast which is actually the oldest platform i've been on by the way i have like four i mean almost 400 episodes on there you can go back six years ago and listen to the difference in terms of like what i was talking about then and what i'm talking about now and part of the reason that we document the stuff the mission the
(20:00) business for acquisition.com is the document to share the best practices of building world-class companies is that it how shitty is it that jeff bezos doesn't have a vlog of him being like day 37 at amazon you know trying to trying to get these books shipped out you know had some shipping issues today but you know going to get after it tomorrow like how invaluable would it be if we could look back at jeffy b's you know library of content and see him build one of the biggest companies of all time same with steve jobs same with
(20:29) elon musk right and so i was my hope is that you know we get to a billion and beyond and i i hope that because i want to have the journey documented with the lessons that i learned along the way and the the shifts in belief like earlier today i got asked by somebody who's listened to all my podcasts they're like hey podcast 86 which by the way is four and a half years ago they're like you said this thing and i was like you know i think i've shifted my understanding of that and so i was like there's more nuance to it and so it's really cool for yourself to
(20:57) document these things and when you do do it from that perspective which is to do it for yourself to do it because you believe it should be made because you want to add to the body of knowledge rather than preach to somebody to do it not because you want to feature ego because you want to feed the audience if you can do it from that perspective then i think the audience can feel the intention and so that kind of leads to what i would consider to be like probably one of the later points in the in the presentation which is the whole concept around giving which is
(21:21) first off humans are exceptionally good at sniffing out intention and i think that's evolutionary and deeply wired in us because we have to know when we're getting double crossed we have to know and try and be able to guess if someone's lying to us and so we're actually very very good like even people who have like necessarily like lower iqs or lower processing power still can have exceptionally good ability at sniffing out lying and sniffing out in tension just sniffing out like into ill will and so because it's evolutionary if you weren't able to do that you get double crossed you get your coconut stolen right and so we have this really innate
(21:54) very tuned instrument inside of us that can hear attention in tonality and micro expressions and so i don't think you can fake it i think you just have to truly shift your perspective so that you can live in that way authentically which is to actually believe that if you give to your audience over a long enough period of time you will reap higher rewards and so i want to be clear since day one i've always been in it to make money but i think that the vehicle that we use to make money is a longer game and i got asked on i think evan carmichael the only other time i've been on instagram
(22:27) live was like hey man why are you one of the good guys who like why haven't you like sold out or whatever and i was like well first off i want to be clear we're equating selling with bad which i would never do um number one number two is that i'm absolutely a capitalist and long-term greedy it's just that i think that me working with companies thinking about my unique skills of getting someone from three to thirty three to fifty million is more valuable for me to work with a handful of people just everyone else stuff for free so that they can get to the level that i can then work with them right rather than trying to build a
(22:58) massive infrastructure around you know helping tens of thousands of people try and consume the content when i can just give it to them for free right which leads to another big point that i have around this at least a belief that i have which is give away the secrets sell the implementation and so a lot of people have info behind walls and that's fine i'm not saying there's anything wrong with that but the real value add for the service is the implementation the accountability the troubleshooting and
(23:22) the perspective from which to solve the problem so i'll give you an example so let's say you want to get better at sales right so i could make tons of sales content if i wanted to and then people be like wow this guy's really good at sales because i give away all the secrets right but they might consume it and be a little bit better but they would be even better if they had a coach who's like listening to their calls and seeing like see right here you paused and then she lost trust with you or hey see how here you should have made this
(23:46) into a question rather than making a command and if you did that you could have sold more off your back foot than your front foot right or like dude you missed report in the first two seconds because you said this instead of this right and then the whole call has been off since then or she said this objection early on and then you didn't catch it so she just detonated it in the sale and you should have confronted that earlier right and so if you if you don't have the perspective from which to get better at the skill because you already
(24:09) only have your baseline skill set because you can't it's very difficult to self-appraise that is where having coaches mentors people who are better at teaching the skill comes into play and so you give away the secrets to prove you are good because here's the here's the flip side people were like what if what if i what if i give away all these secrets and everyone consumes them right what if you give away a whole bunch of [ __ ] and everyone consumes it which one do you think you're gonna make more money on people make their purchasing decisions based on the value they've already
(24:42) received not the value that they're going to receive like it's a really big point that took me way too long to learn one of the strongest persuasive powers in existence is reciprocity if people get something they feel almost like it's like sick to their stomach they have to give something back right it's just most people are like it's not everyone there are some crazies out there for most humans because all of our civilization has been based on this concept of reciprocity right and so you can force reciprocity in your
(25:10) direction by just jamming so much good will and so much value down someone's throat that they just feel like they have to vomit back on you in terms of value because they're so full on value they're like getting drunk with the value that you're providing for them and so when you do that it results in a sale and i'll tell you one of the lessons that i learned later this has just at least been true for me is that the end of your value ladder of the ascensions that you can create for a customer is predicated on the last thing that you provided that was in excess of
(25:36) value from what you charged so if you think about the first thing you do is your content is free it's worth more than what you're giving because you're giving away everything and so then they purchase the first thing and if that first thing let's say is a thousand dollars but it makes them ten thousand dollars they're like well [ __ ] yeah what else you got you're like well i got a ten thousand dollar thing and they're like i'm in and then they make 100 and they're like dude what else you got you're like i got a hundred thousand dollar thing and this is the part where people [ __ ] up is that
(26:00) the hundred thousand dollar thing they get a hundred thousand dollars of value and then what they have done is now they have now completely squeezed the price to valley discrepancy and what they have is not a a raving customer but a satisfied customer and then that is where the customer relationship ends and so the idea of being able to consistently and always have more demand than you can fulfill is predicated or is based on the ability to always provide not just a little bit more but significantly more than you are charging for and so there's two ways of
(26:31) doing that one is you can decrease your price to the point where it's basically nothing and so if you give anything over nothing it seems more which is what is kind of the premise around free content but the thing is is that free content does have a cost it's just not monetary it's time and attention how many people do you know who make content and they get no [ __ ] engagement on it it might be you you might be that person why do you think that is because the price of free is still not worth it real [ __ ] right and so the idea is like if you are in
(27:00) that situation you make this free content you say content doesn't work and so you keep putting out shittier and shittier content because you keep saying that it doesn't work i think if you can flip the script and say hey what if i made all of the stuff that i have that's free more valuable than what my competitors are currently charging for what if i make my free stuff better than their paid stuff and if you really truly try and do that not just like say that but live that look at think about all the deliverables
(27:25) that happen think about all the the checklist and the and the cheat sheets and the visuals and the videos and the in-depth trainings that you would provide if you were to try and get your course and what if you just gave that away what happens if someone makes 100 a month using your free stuff they [ __ ] want to give you money to buy more from you reciprocity and so as long as the next thing that you have can provide even more value because probably if you were able to help them make a hundred thousand dollars off of
(27:54) your free stuff you probably have enough expertise to help them make a million dollars right and so that's the idea here is like how can we provide so much value and access that they want to continue to buy from us over and over and over again right that's the that's the stick and so when we're chunking back out to this right i said in the beginning we've got our our five method right we can test we test the right stuff then we uh record the stuff then we add call to actions to the stuff so we direct the traffic where we want we contextualize it to platforms and
(28:24) then we increase our volume that's the tactics the heart behind it is that we think i will only talk about the things that i know of that no one can question i will talk about how i did something not how to do something i'll talk about what my clients did not what you should do and i will base that from a perspective of i will try and give away as much as humanly possible so much so that it makes me sick to my stomach and i'm very afraid of the amount of value that i'm giving because i know that based on reciprocity if i give more value out there i will
(28:53) get more in return because you can give at scale with content so think about this if it costs you the same amount to provide value in a video to one person as it does to provide value to a million people who watch a video just think about it conceptually it costs you no more effort to do that but the beautiful thing with technology is that there's still only one of you to receive from everything that you did on a multiple with leverage at scale like i don't know if you can see this visual but you do one level of effort
(29:23) one input and technology amplifies it to everyone but then it all has to come back into one which is you and so you could this is how you can amass significant wealth like this is how it works so caleb asked me the other day he's like dude people say leverage all the time he's like what does leverage even mean this is what leverage means leverage means the ratio between inputs to outputs in a system and so if the input that we have is time or money if we have something that has lots of leverage it means we get a huge multiplier effect if i put one unit in i get 10 units out i get 100 units out
(30:00) that is a high leverage activity or system and so the aggregation of wealth for people who have money is a function of understanding time because wealth is based on the fundamenta fundamental unit of money money is a foundational unit of time why because you can trade them back and forth everybody here can trade their time for money it's a it's an even exchange system and so here's what's interesting everyone can trade time for money but you can trade some time for more money right and so what we're doing when we gain leverage is we're looking at and
(30:33) this is the people who are the wealthiest is that they have control over their time so that when they do give it they get the most out of it right and so the game of business to aggregate wealth is to play with higher and higher and higher amounts of leverage over the one thing that we all have the same amount of which is time and so mastering that is the key to becoming wealthy so you you master your time in order to master your money and so there's two components to mastering time you have mastery of time which comes down to the micro which is the day
(31:03) to day the speed of activity and i can tell you right now if you talk to somebody you say hey we should do this thing right and then boom they've got this organized they've already done two or three messages and then like it's getting done tomorrow i guarantee you that that person is going to be more wealthy because they have a micro mastery of their time right on the map actually i'm gonna explain that even a little bit further so think about this from from an organizational perspective imagine that the default time period that you use to get something done
(31:32) is let's say a week let's say that's just the unspoken default that's the cultural default of like hey we need to start this project hey can you get this this thing to me they said cool i'll get you by end of week right end of week that's d500 is okay with that right but let's say because you want to become a master of wealth and you understand that time is huge is one of the is one of the biggest components of wealth you then say no guys the new default is end of day for all activities unless stated otherwise that becomes the new norm and
(31:57) so let's say that this project that we had originally has several back and forth interactions they give something to you it takes a week you get them something back it takes a week to take a week take a week take weeks the whole thing takes seven weeks right now imagine it was end of day the same output happens in one seventh of the time because we both get a dumb end of day next day two things happen next day two things happen next day two things happen and then boom the project's done what took two months
(32:22) takes somebody else four days and when you multiply that effect over a year over a decade that is when you see the outsized returns in wealth and money because of mastery on the micro of time the second component of time is the macro perspective of time which is are all of the activities acting in alignment with my overall goal and do i believe that they can compound on one another are they directionally aligned over a decade over three decades so that i can have a compounding effect leverage in action
(32:54) over a longer period of time so that my input is is far less or my output far outweighs the input that i did because i let time work as an asset rather than a liability most people's plans when you add time get worse what you want to do is play games where if you wait you win and so those are the games that we want to set up and those are the games that the people who are truly wealthy understand and so i can tell you having dealt with people who make significantly more money than me their mastery of the micro of understanding how speed moves
(33:25) things forward because on a macro scale of getting things done day day day day day day rather than week week week week means that at the end of the year they have 40 times the output and people are like that's not fair said life was supposed to be right and so this micro kind of exchange that happens there gets enhanced and magnified and people get upset about it but the thing is is you can either decry the system and hate on it or you can accept it for what it is and just choose to play the game and win the way you want to if that's what you want and so
(33:57) as the micro and then from the macro perspective like i was saying earlier is that the biggest shift that i see in people who are wealthy is that they talk in decades not days and i can tell you based on the time period that someone talks in when they talk about their plans how wealthy they are or to be fair how wealthy they will be and so if you have truly realistic plans that you're like this is what's gonna take me about 10 years if you hear someone say that i can tell you that they're going to be successful and if
(34:28) you can shift your perspective to that where you actually start planning and like okay it would be unreasonable that if i did this for 10 straight years that i wouldn't be significantly wealthier than i am today so that's what i'm gonna do and then having the singularity of mine to not get distracted and so there's three things they did a research study on this i found this interesting hopefully it will too actually you guys digging this because i was this you guys good digging um and if you want throw some questions in there uh because i'll wrap up my little
(34:58) my little my little diatribe here um there's three things that they found that made people who were ultra successful and ultra successful i i wish i had the definition for what they define as ultra successful but we'll just leave it at that they said they have a superiority complex and they think that they are in some way better than other people and deserve more than others number one number two they have massive insecurity and fear of failure they they never think that they will measure up or be good enough interesting paradox and then number three
(35:30) is they have impulse control and so think about this from a bigger picture perspective they have the superiority conflict so they believe that they can accomplish these amazing things like how like some people if you tell them your goals they'll say how dare you think that way how dare you believe that you could accomplish something like that and so it takes a little bit of delusion in order to think i'm gonna make an iphone whatever the [ __ ] that is i'm gonna put a computer in everyone's hand in the world
(35:53) i'm gonna do that right most people think it's hubris and the only thing that separates genius and insanity is what happens is outcome right and so they have this this vision of where they want to go and they believe they can do big stuff number one number two they have this fuel that they push away from from always feeling they'll never be good enough right that's what drives them towards this this outcome and the number three and this is the big one this is the one that everyone messes up is they have the impulse control to stay focused on it and not let shiny objects distract them even though there's
(36:25) another opportunity comes up two years in they're like no if i keep doing what i'm doing and i follow the plan that i set i will be it would be unreasonable that i do not achieve the goal that i have could this help maybe but even if i don't do that i will still get there and i would rather take the get rich for sure than get rich quick way every day and most people this is my finding at least if you were to sit down with someone and say here's a contract you sign here and you're going to live on 30 000 a year
(36:55) for the next five years but at the end of that five years you'll be able to make a million dollars a year most people would sign that contract but they don't live like they would sign that contract and so if you can and the reason that that contract works is because it delays the gratification it it separates the i'm going to have the cookie today from i want to have a six-pack for life right it's the i will suffer for this long period of time i will make the hundred dials i will make the hundred pieces of content a week i will spend 100 a day on advertising and sacrifice my lifestyle in order to learn not to
(37:31) get rich but to learn the skills that will make me rich eventually and i know that if i accumulate these skills because i'm dedicated to that and i'm willing to sacrifice more than other people to achieve my dreams and i'm gonna i'm gonna put a pit on this real quick because i think this is real how many of you to save humanity would sacrifice your life like throw a like a like or a thumbs up or something like that like how many of you guys attack like would give your life for maybe even your country right a lot of people would do that a lot of our military do we appreciate that you serve
(38:01) like how many people would do that or save your family pause why is it that that is more important than your dreams because i was asked in an interview a few days ago why were you willing to sacrifice so much and i feel like the better question is why are people not willing to sacrifice anything it's like if you're willing to sacrifice your life give the ultimate price for a country or for whatever why would you not give at least that much to realize the potential that you believe you have and so that's for me why the sacrifices never
(38:44) felt like sacrifices they felt like trade-offs and for me they were trade-offs they were prices i was willing to pay and so it's like if there was a pair of shoes that i wanted it was 500 and i bought them and someone's like don't you feel guilty about spending 500 i would say no that was the price and i was willing to pay because i wanted the shoes period and so if there's a price tag that we can ascribe to our dreams or to the potential that we believe that we have which is what we want to pay down as regret in the future for not having it
(39:12) if you read the price tag and it says you know football with the boys dodgeball during the week you know drinking a couple of nights some a little bit groggy if that's the price tag is that a price i'm willing to pay and i think if you are you'll get significantly closer to what you're trying to do and so that was uh that was the the general gist of the uh of the chat that i had not chat it was a presentation at the best do you guys like that was that cool i didn't get a little bit of recap and this is not the
(39:38) normal style it's the first q a q a ever you can thank caleb hopefully i won the bet and he's he's not told me that anyone actually is live so i could just be ranting at the uh iphone but if you guys have cues or a's about any of that stuff um let me know in the chat and uh caleb will read them out to me and then uh we'll uh rock and roll from there a common question we got is what would be your number one tip for building a sales team okay number two for building a sales team is hire a very good sales manager
(40:10) that's a that's a very serious answer hire somebody who's already built a sales team that's the the real answer the second and much harder answer is learn to sell yourself learn to sell the product um train the next person to manage the product read books on sales management which comes down to communication cadence and managing uh a training process a recruiting process and then a management process so there's three big things that have to happen in the sales team you have to recruit the right talent which by the way let me save you a lot of time it comes down to much more of the picking than it does to the training
(40:41) right because it's much easier to take somebody's naturally graded baseball and get them better than get somebody who has zero eye hand coordination and trying to get them to become a pro you can it'll take you three times as much time to get someone from a 205 then it takes someone to take a seven to a nine all right so number one is being able to spot your town and recruit them onto your team number two is the training component which is you need to get as specialized as humanly possible and here's the key point that i think most people mess up in their sales training they focus on
(41:06) the product not the prospect so the whole time they're trying to educate their team on the bells and the whistles and the things and the differentiators between them in the competition well most of the time the other people have on the phone don't even know the competition number one number two they don't even understand the features because they don't understand the problem and so what we should be talking about is why are you here what problem are we solving and then we should have very deep context to what are the common issues
(41:28) that the prospect is suffering from because at the end of the day the more accurately you can depict the pain someone is experiencing the more you can enter the internal conversation and dialogue that's happening in their mind the more they will believe whatever you have next and so if i can perfectly describe what your situation is right now just imagine that i was able to describe your life and the things that you suffer from right now perfectly if i said if i just described it all to you be like geez it's like this guy like knows everything i'd be like and that's why i think you're a good fit for the program i wouldn't even need to tell you
(41:57) about the program because you'd be like geez i mean if he understands my problem that well then i'm sure the solution will work and so that's why also from a flexibility standpoint if you train your sales team on the prospect you can swap products out as as needed but the prospect will probably not change and so when we're training so first we recruit the right people we pick right right so the uh the the championships are one in the draft right not not in the offseason number two is that we train around the prospect on the product
(42:26) and number three is that we manage around the values of the team in the headspace and we manage towards one key thing which is conviction because if you have somebody who's been recruited well and they've been trained on the pains of the prospect the only reason someone's not going to be able to sell is because they lack conviction something happened they got a text they got a call somebody's complaining about something and all of a sudden their conviction drops and you can see this because if someone was hot and then goes cold it's not because they
(42:50) don't know how to sell because they were hot they already know how to sell it's because they stop feeling motivated to close and so when someone gives them the initial objection they shrink away because they don't believe that they're really helping the person and so then they don't want to push any further because i can tell you let me say this imagine imagine you went back in time and you were going to talk to your old self from 10 years ago right and you wanted to say hey there's this thing called bitcoin you should get into it and sell it on this day all right i know it means nothing
(43:22) right now this is the day that you're going to sell it on but here's the thing if you went back in time you had to not be you you had to just come in another body so to you you're a perfect stranger but you're talking to yourself think about how you would sell that person that is what somebody with conviction sounds like and every everything that they come up with to be like let me let me let's let's dive into this more you're suffering from this let's let's let's pull these pieces apart no like i think we do need to make a decision because every day like you
(43:52) start breaking it down the way you would talk would change because of the level you were convicted and a key point on conviction is not that it's binary this is a false thing that people say it's not do you believe in the product or not believe the product it's to what extent do you believe in the product how deeply you believe in product i ask you a question have you ever have you ever talked to somebody about something and they had some cockamania something that was insane right but they talked about it with so much
(44:19) conviction that you started to question your own beliefs because i convicted they were that is the power of conviction over any tactic in sales and that's again the thing that i was talking about earlier with the intention right people can smell out intention and so if you have the genuine deep desire to help the prospect and you genuinely believe that this product or program or service is going to change their life then selling gets easy the hard part is doing that which is why most of sales get fixed by fixing those things and not
(44:48) necessarily having some super insane program for training you pick the right people you teach them about your prospects but the things that they're really struggling with and you teach them to have a question-based conversation which is why are you here what have you struggled with in the past why didn't that work okay now that i've understood those things i think you might be a good fit for our program can i tell you about it yes x y and z does that make sense cool we can move forward it doesn't have to be complicated right like that simple
(45:11) sales script is what we taught thousands and thousands of gym owners and they closed millions and millions and hundreds of millions of dollars in sales using that because the more complexity you add to the system the easier it is to break and so for me i've always taught off question-based frameworks because when you just ask questions it always gives you a home base so if someone goes out you know they're all the way out in outer space you've got to bring them back a question can always bring someone right back on point you're like thank you so much for sharing that
(45:35) boom next question right you can walk them down towards the sale so when scaling a sales team best option is to hire an experienced sales manager done this before if you can't do that then you need to learn how to do the sale yourself recruit someone who has the already ideally track record work ethic intelligence candor to sell and ideally in a selling environment those similar years if you're doing high volume transactional sales then you want somebody's done high volume transactional sales if you're doing you know enterprise level sales then you want somebody who's done a long sale cycle who's probably more of a farmer
(46:07) than a hunter it's different personality stuff you got to make sure that you match those so you start recruiting then you create a question-based framework just for the script and the rest of the time you're educating them on the prospect not the product and then finally from a management perspective if someone is dipping all of the effort goes towards raising their conviction educating them on all of the things that we're doing to help our our prospects succeed giving them the testimonials having live clients hop on and talk
(46:29) about how their life has changed saying hey dan remember how you sold johnny two weeks ago well here's johnny and his life's totally different johnny left like can you share your experience all of a sudden dan now feels like the next guy he gets on the phone with is just like johnny and that is how you can fix someone's sales without even having to get into the nitty-gritty and sure every morning you do your huddle you know deal with the overcomes people are struggling with make sure we drill stuff do the role-playing you obviously have to do
(46:54) that that's the blocking attack that we're selling but if you want to build a world-class sales team it comes down to the culture of conviction so that answered that question what are uh three books that you would recommend people read i've only read one so uh i honest real talk i think it would be much better so i have this youtube video that says i was once weak uh it's on my channel i genuinely think it's the best i mean i i think it's it's one of the best presentations i've ever given and it's literally just about closing and i
(47:24) think if you just it's 90 minutes of just straight closes and if you can understand that and it and it shows you an ethical approach to closing which is about giving the power to the prospect because the reason that people don't buy isn't because they don't want to buy it's because they're afraid to make a mistake and so what they do is they give their power away and so there's three ways to give their power away from the outside end they give it to their circumstances first so that's time that's money or that's some particular aspect of the program they don't like so time wise i'm not going to get into all the
(47:54) overcomers because it could go forever but time wise we all know that it's not about time it's about priorities right how can how can somebody become a self-made billionaire you know what i mean and like we all have the same amount of time so that's and i can give you the actual scripting around that but just watch the video to explain it the second for circumstances is money which is not about money it's not about resources about resourcefulness so what's the difference between somebody who's broke and a billionaire who lost everything and then builds it back again
(48:17) well both people have ground zero at one point but the difference is that one person is resourceful the other person isn't and so it's not about resources about resourcefulness so right now if you are broke every south paid billionaire who was broke you're in the exact same position as them so which means it's not an excuse which means if let's say tomorrow you needed a 50 000 surgery how would you come up with the money how would you come up with it and this is an easy question for everybody because this is this is what i think really drives it home that sounds like a hypothetical who here is on the live right now
(48:46) motivation love you guys by the way you guys digging this is this cool rocking okay who here has had an unexpected bill come up maybe something like maybe your car breaks down maybe you have a tax bill for my business owners any huge tax bills all of a sudden they came up what about uh what about a payroll tax for example that you forgot that you weren't paying anybody or you have a major water breakage right you're still here you still have a phone you're still on instagram right now so you obviously survived and here's what's interesting we are willing to become resourceful
(49:24) when we feed someone else but not ourselves so when you had to pay your landlord and pay rent you figured out a way when you had to pay the tax bill the irs you figured out a way when you had to pay the bill for your car breaking down you figured out a way but for some reason when it comes to investing in yourself you're not and so that's because people blame the circumstances rather than themselves and so we peel this back right so we're having this conversation with the prospect and so the three things circumstances so time money fit so fit
(49:56) is like uh i'll give you a simple example they say uh there's broccoli on this meal plan i hate broccoli i don't eat broccoli right and the easiest overcome there is just you gotta change the change there's a lot of stuff that you can unpeel there but you just simply say like i mean so many people are like hey well i currently eat this for breakfast can i just like have that on the meal plan i'm like well that breakfast got you that body so probably not got to change the change that's the fundamental truth there so those are the three that happen in
(50:25) circumstances the next level that people will cast [ __ ] to pass their power to is other people so to say i can't do this because my spouse can't do it with my kids i can't do it because my employees i can't do it because uh big bird doesn't matter right the thing is they will say i can't make the decision because i'm relying on someone else to make this decision and there's a fundamental flaw in this and the big flaw is this is that if we fast forward the clock two years who are you going to blame for the life that you have yourself or the person that you're giving all the power to of course them
(50:55) and that's not fair the relationship that you're going to have and so what you're doing is you're asking for permission when you should be asking for support real talk and so the thing is is obviously there's sub ones underneath of that which is like hey do they you know they approve your current situation you know if they say you know no they don't approve it they're not happy that i'm you know feeling this way it's like cool then why would they be against something they already don't approve of cool if the rules were reversed what do you
(51:18) think would happen would you help would you be okay with them doing something to help themselves well why do you think it would be different for them right like you can these are all like the simple like mini mini overcomes but the big one is that you're asking for permission instead of support right because you really have to logically play this out and so once you get someone to say you know what you're right like i need to take control of this cool now we're talking to somebody who's in charge all right which gives
(51:40) you the last circle and the last circle is avoidance is that now when someone says i need to think about it or i'm not sure at least you're talking to somebody who's in charge which is amazing and so if you're a sales person and someone gives you a circumstance thing you might be two levels that you have to still keep overcoming to get to the gold now if someone says a spouse thing you might have to overcome that and then still have to overcome an avoidance thing but if you can think about peeling back the
(52:04) onion from the outside in then what we're doing is we're not selling we're giving this person the power to make a decision and the objective of the sale i'm going to say this i want to just [ __ ] inscribe this in everyone's hearts is that the point of the sale is not to get them to buy the point of the sales to get them to decide and so if you guys don't know the definition of of decide comes from latin which is to cadare which means to literally cut off and so the question you ask the prospect is that's what this word means and so the question is which future are
(52:33) we cutting off today are we cutting off the future that is more aligned with the dreams that you're trying to accomplish are we cutting off the past that you're trying to step out of which which path are we cutting off today right we need to make a decision all right and so now at this point when you're in avoidance you're talking to somebody in power and so we have to do is get them to confront that is the theme of this one so we have to get them to confront the decision which most of the time just means they don't even know how to make a decision and so i like to use the frame of past present future
(53:05) and so the past is saying is usually overcoming past worries that they've had past mistakes they've had so simple examples like hey i did something like this in the past it didn't work i'm afraid of the same thing happening again right i call this the burn you twice which is hey do you ever date anybody in middle school yes are you married to them no did you swear off the entire gender because you had a bad experience no well because if you did then you'd be allowing that bad experience to burn you twice once when
(53:29) you paid for it and didn't have it work out and second when it prevented you from meeting the love of your life and so we can't take that one experience and let it burn you a second time so that's not a good reason is it and then it's like well do you think that eventually you're going to do this do this thing right this is me getting in the future but like the more fluid you get with this the better you'll get but getting into futures like do you think you're going to like be struggling with this forever well no okay well do you think you're going to eventually have to do this sure or if you're going to do it
(53:53) eventually might as well do it now right and so there's the past which is about you know burning twice the other thing that you can pull from the past is like do you think the reason we're having the conversation right now is because you've had trouble deciding do you think you've gotten this point multiple times in the past you haven't been able to pull the trigger and that's why we're here today how much is not making this decision cost you up to this point is it more than the cost of this i don't think this is a fast decision because you've been making this decision
(54:21) the last five years today's just the first day we're taking action on it right so we can keep like you can keep going through that's all past right presidents they admit all that stuff and then now you're boom you're in the present with the person and you have somebody who's in power who who shakes off all the [ __ ] they've had in the past you're like great do you know what it takes to make the decision and usually they'll say no and you're like great there's three things that you need to figure out one is do you think the product is going to help you solve the problem that you have
(54:45) the way that you want it to be solved yes or no yes great do you want to work with me and or us yes or no right do you know someone or have access the amount of money to get started yes or no if they say yes then you're like great we just made the decision what card you want to use you have to help them make the decision and if they're still there they're like you know what if you're anything like me you're probably afraid of making a mistake does that sound fair what are you most afraid of having happen right what are you afraid of
(55:17) i think it's one of the most powerful questions in negotiations and sales because you're what are you afraid of having happen let's play it out right and this gets into another close call let's consider the options right but say like let's consider the options like worst case scenario right i go to vegas i take your credit card number i send it to a nigerian prince he maxes everything out and you don't get the result you want right right okay do you think that's gonna happen no okay well at least we're not there right okay so we're we're getting closer to gold
(55:43) we're getting closer all right what's the what's the real worst case well i just don't want to fail again okay that's beautiful what would make you feel like you're not going to fail again what would you need to say and then this as soon as they start answering this question you've got them it doesn't matter because the thing is they're going to say i wouldn't see this in this and you're like we already have that you shouldn't know about it because i didn't talk about features earlier because that's not important it's important is how you feel because at the end of the day like you just have to trust that our intention because you
(56:11) have to trust the person more than the paper right to walk them through the process and so even then i think in the future i wouldn't get into it but you get the idea here so big picture what we're talking is this is this valuable for everybody is this joe because i can talk about sales all day can i get some hearts and stuff okay cool caleb's talking because i i still this could be the ultimate prank because i still can't see the phone and so right now in my mind i'm talking to myself this entire time so so big picture you have these big
(56:40) concentric circles from the outside people who start with the lightest [ __ ] because it's the easiest thing to cast your power to i don't have time i'm too busy i don't have the money uh you know this doesn't sound like a perfect fit for me those are the easy things right and we go one one step closer to that which is then is other people right and then we say hey it's about asking for support on permission right we explain how in the future they're going to blame them for for everything and that's not fair to them it's not fair the relation if you want to value the relationship long term this is what you have to do you have to
(57:10) own the decision cool boom now we're in the present and we go past present future past we get them to give up all of the reasons that they've failed before as not something that's getting influenced today you teach them how to make a decision and then you confront their concerns that they might have and you can talk around them right and the easiest one and i'm still working on creating a framework around this but i'll share it with you and you can share with your sales teams if you like it then i'm trying to figure out like a skeleton key overcome and so there's two
(57:33) that have a high degree like you can use them in a ton of scenarios and i've used them all time so you can use them for your sales team number one is called the reason close and the reason close is whatever reason they give you you say that's the perfect reason you should do this so if they're like dude i don't have the money to start the program like that's the exact reason you need to do this program if they're like i don't have the time to start the program like that's because like this is the very reason you do the program right it doesn't matter what the thing
(57:55) is you just say that's the very reason you need to do this right so it's called the reason close the second close is something i'm working on called like the hypothetical close so you guys have probably heard of like the unicorn clothes and the one to ten clothes those are all closes that have similar themes around them and if you're not familiar with that is you know the one to ten closes you know if this were a one and you hated it uh i wanna skip from one and that would be alex you suck i hate you your breath smells and i never wanna see you again
(58:18) and ten being like this is uh this is a program that i want to get started today right uh where are you at right and here's the key it doesn't matter what number that they say let's say they say six you say okay cool well what would you what would it take to make you attend and they literally give you the thing that they said to get a yes and then you can also flip it and say why aren't you a one and then they start selling you on why it's good right and so that's the one to ten clothes the unicorn clothes is similar which is just like hey if this were some
(58:47) amazing uniform program would you do it they say yes now if they say no then you say cool then i don't think we need to talk about this stuff affiliated with something else going on and then you can start attacking the actual uh the objection which is like you don't trust me like let's talk about that right but this is what i'm working on for skeleton t so i gave you the the reason clothes the other one is the skeleton key and so which is the hypothetical clothes and so this is what i'm working on so i'm so
(59:10) figuring this out but if i said the hype whatever thing they say so let's say it's time let's say it's money doesn't matter and i say cool so time's the issue right okay so uh if time weren't the issue would you do it you guys see where this got right and then they're like well yeah you're like cool and then we dig in and say then what would it look like to have time and then they have to generate the responses and we're like oh cool well that's not going to take that much time the first thing we're going to do is replace all these activities which you're spending you're spending all your time on not getting results and replace
(59:43) with things that are great solve the problem and so what happens with the hypothetical close you basically take their object their obstacle and you say cool if that obstacle didn't exist would you do it because the thing is is once they say yes you got a hypothetical yes so all we have to do is match the conditions of the hypothetical yes in the real world and then we close the deal and so those are two of the strongest like multi-use closes that work at any point in this whole kind of equation um that i like a lot that i've used like a
(1:00:11) fair amount and so you can use those with your team but just like hey sweet you guys have any more uh any more questions because i know that was that was really valuable um like it was a good question uh one of the questions is uh this was from a while back but how do you deal with failure uh i mean i don't want this to sound like dismissive as an answer but like most people just have the wrong i don't say wrong like i just don't i don't i don't feel bad about failure because i don't see failure as bad
(1:00:45) and so this this chunks up into a larger conversation which is that most people ascribe labels positive or negative labels to situations and so this again gets into my worldview which i'm not going to get into but we have a meaning maker in our in our heads and so our entire lives when we're children we're going around and we're just asking adults what does that mean what does that mean what does that mean and we just take whatever they tell us as the meaning for things right and the thing is we don't remember every single person who told us what every single thing meant we just
(1:01:14) took it as fact and then later on in our lives when we have enough other meanings that we can triangulate positions on we can say that doesn't make sense i don't know if that's true and the problem that most of us have is that we deem failure and we were told that failure meant that we were a failure and that's false because failure is a necessary part is a requisite for success and so here's the thing this is something i can promise you if you are not failing right now you are not going to succeed it is a requisite it's a requirement for success and so how do i feel not bad
(1:01:49) about failure well if i told you that there was seven steps to success let's just say and you were on step four would you feel bad of course no but let's just say that step four is failing all it is is just unpacking the label that we've ascribed to this thing and just looking at it for what it really is which means i made an attempt and i learned something and then i will incorporate that new learning to take one step closer to what i what my desired outcome is and like all of life is a learning process not to get like two whatever but like that's what it is and so the idea
(1:02:20) is that we see failure is bad that's the problem that's all it is so that's it genuinely and i i hope it doesn't come unrelatable off unrelatable but like it just doesn't bother me everyone's asking about the your next book i it will be done when it is worthy of your attention and so right now i have right now i've i've written five versions end to end of the leads book and i'll just tell you guys what the problem is the problem is that the offers book was such a defined thing that i was fixing that i could
(1:02:58) create a manual to solve it and everyone could immediately read it and then 10x the prices do all these things and improve how much money they're making when it comes to leads it's actually a significant more complex topic and so it's not just like how do i do cold calling how do i do cold emailing how do i do cold messenger how do i do how do i run ads how do i do direct mail how do i do how do i make posts how do i make content how do i make like all of those things are have to have to encapsulate it in the book which i think i've done an okay job chunking up but the issue is i wanted it
(1:03:30) to also be for me if you followed any of my stuff there's two two things ideally three but two that are requirements is that it must be valid and it must be useful valid means that it's correct in a large number of scenarios ideally in all scenarios that means it has a high degree of validity useful means that if i actually do this thing i will get the desired end goal even if the y is not true but if i do these things i get the angle and so i'll give an example above so something that is valid but not useful would be if i
(1:03:59) said something's work and some things don't that is 100 valid it's also not useful at all right and on the flip side so many so many sales marketing etc gurus for example say like there are seven stages of awareness and this is how someone walks through a lead to become a customer and they start retroactively putting in thoughts into a prospect's mind when we have no date no way to validate that now if we do the actions that they say in order to sell stuff it might totally work but it doesn't mean it's valid because i might buy something not for those reasons and
(1:04:33) so the idea is i need to be both valid i need to be useful and the third bonus for me is that it's entertaining because if it's valid and useful then that will make people money and many self-motivated people will just go through it for those things because they know that this is a cheat code to making money but if i get it to be entertaining then i get more people to consume and ultimately win so for the book right now it is valid but the utility is lower outside of just baseline understanding how to [Music]
(1:05:01) market conceptually and so that has been the issue that i'm having because i'm trying to figure out whether i need to like write you know eight sub books which is a lot of work obviously um and just have one book that explains conceptually how this works so i'll give you i'll give you some stuff that like this might be interesting for you guys that i had to unpack what's the difference between promotion marketing and advertising right what is a lead what's a lead if i get a subscriber on youtube is that a lead if i get a follower on instagram is that
(1:05:31) a lead what what makes it a lead what makes it not a lead i'll tell you the definition that i have the book which is information that you can leverage to create a transaction that is a lead so if i get a subscriber on youtube that is not a lead if i get a follower on instagram that is a lead right because i can leverage that conversation create a transaction they might say well the follower on youtube would maybe buy something yes but after something else happens right if they commented and i said hey give me your
(1:06:00) number now i have the information leverage to create a transaction right and so um i've been i've been trying to peel these layers back to create with absolute clarity something that people who want to get more customers and the procedure of that is getting more lead flow or deal flow if i that they could read the book and immediately execute everything in the book and increase their lead flow and so that has been the trouble that i've had in trying to encapsulate that simply in a simple book while also accounting for
(1:06:28) all of the disparate ways that you can generate leads through attention and so the second big breakthrough that i had was something that i called the advertising cycle which you'll have to read the book um but basically i made 58 broken models to get this to work the way i needed it to and i would consider this the value equation of this book and so um i am working on it it just because we're also running acquisition.
(1:06:52) com um and actually like growing the business why not like writing the book um takes time and i just won't put out a product that i don't think is deserving of your attention and so i will always hold that as the hard line and so i promise that when it is done it will be worthy of it to the best of my human ability so um with that being said i hope you guys enjoyed the first live ever q a of uh solo if you guys uh can give a caleb a shout out because this was all his idea and if no one's there i will blame him and i will have won the bet that i've been talking to myself for this entire time um
(1:07:27) but anyways uh mozation i love you guys uh if you for some reason are new on here um we have a book that's 99 cents that a lot of people are referencing anything that's 5 000 five-star reviews on amazon it's 99 cents if you want to check it out a lot of people get value from it um the the podcast uh is you're a podcast listener we have a podcast that encapsulates a lot of this stuff at higher level i don't sell anything like the whole reason acquisition.com is this is because i'm trying to help businesses
(1:07:51) that are doing three million or more and so if you are a business that's doing three million or more and you're on the internet love to work with you hop on acquisition.
(1:08:05) com fill out the fill out the form we'd love to help you get to 30 million and beyond um we've done it six times already so we're pretty good at it especially for this type of business but if you're below three million and you're not in that industry or you're through you're below three million and you're in that industry that's why we make the book we make youtube we make twitter content we make uh instagram content and we just i'm just trying to give everybody the tools they need to uh that i wish i had had um earlier on not saying they're right i'm just saying they've worked for me so anyways appreciate your emoji nation you guys i don't deserve you but i am grateful for
(1:08:27) you nonetheless so thank you guys i'll see you guys the next instagram live

Transcript:
(00:02) i am pissed not really but i recently uh was on a podcast a few months ago via my first million podcast uh with sam and sean great guys and we were talking about my book 100 offers which you can get on amazon kindle for 99 cents if you don't have the dollars for a hardback and i heard on a later podcast that i wasn't on that sean was saying yeah i really love the book um but it's just a bummer it doesn't apply to e-commerce and i disagree and that is why i'm making this video to break down why the value equation and
(00:31) the things inside of the 100 million dollar offers book which pretty much this this visual right here inc you know encapsulates or or summarizes the the vast majority of the pieces in the book and obviously there's a lot more examples and stories and there's you know a lot of five star reviews on amazon so check it out for 99 cents if you want but the main point is that these are variables that create purchasing decisions that get people to value something in order to buy it because they value it in excess of price
(00:55) tag and the idea here is if we understand the things that drive value then we can understand the things that underpin price which then lead to profits all right and so in the book i do give a lot of uh service based examples uh both b2b and b2c but i wanted to take this video uh to do something a little bit different and talk about how it applies to e-commerce all right because at the end of the day people buy stuff because they value them right and so the application may be somewhat different but the fundamentals
(01:16) and the the variables are the same okay and so quick recap on this dream outcome is people actually have to want the thing that you're delivering to them number one number two is that when they buy they will buy based on the perceived likelihood that they're actually going to get that thing so it's like a lot of people may want to get rich but they will buy the one that they think that has the highest likelihood of actually them getting there right or a lot of people might want to look skinny but they'll work with the physician that has
(01:36) worked with 10 000 patients rather than their first patient because they're perceived likelihood of actually getting skinny or getting the surgery they want is higher and in a very real way value it more time delay is how quickly something can happen right as between when i buy and when i get if we can compress that time horizon or that timeline the more valuable it is if i can get you a six pack in 30 days for a six pack in 30 months which one you value more of course the 30 days one so we try and compress the time horizon
(01:58) along how we deliver our products and services and then finally effort and sacrifice are the things that we have to start doing that we don't want to do or we have to give up doing that we do want to do as a result of the purchase and so in a perfect world we want to deliver someone the dream outcome and when they buy it because they have extremely high likelihood or they're certain that they're going to achieve that and they're going to achieve it overnight with ease right so fast easy and exactly what they want the way they
(02:20) want it to be delivered all right so that's what we have to think about here now in the book i talk about scarcity urgency guarantees bonuses and naming right and so what i want to do is just apply these and the easiest way to look at this and and prove out the point that this 100 applies to ecommerce is to look at the e-commerce giants all right specifically let's just look at amazon and over time they've really nailed down hitting each and every single one of these variables that drive value now if you are an e-commerce person and you're
(02:44) like why i can't sell on amazon well one is you can the other is that you can start thinking about it through amazon lenses and of course it's taken him 30 years to build this thing right but we can still think if this is the theoretical that we need to try and shoot for this is the ideal scene then we can start taking steps towards it to improve the value of our offerings okay cool now if let's say i wanted to buy a jacket all right so this is a very different example than my normal ones and i have other examples and services
(03:06) in other videos but this one is just for physical products so let's say i wanted to buy a jacket my dream outcome might be that i look good in this jacket that could be an outcome it could be that it's very warm ideally maybe it's both of those things right and i might even want a jacket that looks good and that isn't warm because i just want to wear it because i think it looks good but i don't want to get hot right so it depends on what my dream outcome is right so you're gonna have different messaging for different avatars
(03:24) depending on the on on the product itself and what problem it solves all right so let's just use for example that i just want a fashionable jacket that looks cool okay that's point one around what our dream outcome is great now i may be a buyer who's like but i'm not that fashionable and i don't really know how to like pair stuff and make it look cool all right so what are the ways that we can increase the perceived likelihood of achievement of me achieving this cool look all right well first off is reviews
(03:48) if i have lots of five star reviews on my page and i can read them then i'm more likely to make the purchase because i see other people made the purchase and are happy about it right makes sense that's why reviews amazon pioneered this and then it became commonplace because it increased the perceived likelihood of achievement right what else can we do and i actually saw this levi's did this for selling a jean jack which is why i'm giving the example because it was so masterful and how they did it what they did is that i saw this video it was uh
(04:10) maybe 90 seconds and it had the jean jacket and it had three different ways you can wear it and they showed here's how you pair it with dark stuff here's how you pair it with light stuff here's how you pair it with the same looking jean and blah blah and i was like wow i did not know how jean jackets work but now i do and now i know how to wear it so my perceived likelihood of achieving the dream outcome of looking cool has just gone up simply by them making a video that demonstrated it right these variables apply to services and
(04:35) e-commerce just the same it's just the way that we show someone how to experience the dream outcome they desire differ alright in a let's say it's a i'm teaching a skill i'm going to show somebody who has the skill showing them demonstrating the skill and the results of of having that skill right that would be increasing the perceived likelihood but if it's a physical product then we have to think what's the outcome they want and then how do we increase the likelihood that they they see that and easy ways to demonstrate it
(05:01) right and to literally demonstrate this is probably what you're thinking and here's how it works that's why unboxing videos and things like that work because it decreases the risk associated with making the purchase because they're like oh that's what's going to happen it decreases the other side of me swiping my card what happens after that right and as much as we can demystify what happens after they say oh i now can create expectations and then these this product will meet the expectations and i will be happy great now the next one is
(05:24) time to like amazon has been the pioneer of prime of two day shipping one day shipping one hour shipping right and they continue to try and drive this down because they know that the faster they can get people the things they want the more that they will value and like it and repeat buying on the platform right and so this should be a no-brainer this absolutely applies to e-commerce all right now the next one and that can also apply at different levels right there's the actual purchasing experience but then there's also the experience of
(05:46) using the products it depends on types of products that you have like a jacket might not have a huge time delay in terms of using it if you sold custom tailored stuff then delivering it faster or finding a way to operationalize that more quickly would be very real value right right so there's the purchasing process and then there's also the like the wearing it process all right and like unboxing and actually having them experience again the dream outcome right now finally of these four variables we have effort and sacrifice and so the
(06:09) purchasing decision here amazon has one click purchases with everything on file save so you can make a purchasing decision in a split second right and so that's why the rise of products like bolt and shop pay are all things that have decreased the effort and sacrifice and a lot of ecommerce stores uh have been able to use this to their advantage and make more sales right and that's because in a real way things would become more valuable so it increased the likely that people are going to buy all right but let's look at the other
(06:32) ratchets that i said these are inside of the book are enhancers of value they do even more to increase the value equation in your favor so that you can buy sorry you can sell more stuffs okay so let's look at amazon for example what do they have under virtually every single item how many they have left in stock is their way of showing scarcity only two left only six left only 17 left and then they have it by size right so that they can show scarcity at every single level huh what does that do it drives conversions people want to buy all right
(07:02) are you guys are you guys tracking with me does this feel like it applies to e-commerce let's keep going urgency what else does amazon do they have lightning deals right when you do a limited drop a limited edition drop of a t-shirt there's only 100 printed and we drop them on friday and first come first serve what does that do it gives scarcity and because you were giving a ti there's a time component it adds urgency now to really add urgency we'd say we're only selling these for an hour um but hopefully the point drives home
(07:26) all right but a lightning deal for example where they said we're only giving this price for for 60 minutes that is absolutely urgency all right saying how many you have left is absolutely scarcity are you guys tracking with this all right cool now guarantees so what do we do here well amazon took this one step further not only did they already have a money back guarantee right because it's satisfaction you don't have to do anything you just send it back and they made it easy to return stuff what they did now is try before you buy right so
(07:50) they have seven day layaway so you can buy the thing and they charge you seven days later you can literally try the thing on and not even have to get billed on the card right why'd they do that it's a version of a guarantee why because what we're doing is we're decreasing the risk of someone purchasing right that's what we're doing here we're decreasing the like we're decreasing the likelihood that they have a poor experience which as an inverse increases the likelihood that they do have a positive experience if they
(08:12) choose to purchase so it's like if i'm trying it on before i buy it then i'll be very darn sure that if i like it i might perceive likely to achieve achieving the outcome after i'm wearing it is very very high that's why they did it right this is an implied guarantee it's a version of guaranteed so they technically have two guarantees they have one which is the money back guarantee which has now become almost table stakes for physical products but on top of that they added in a try before you buy all right now bonuses all
(08:36) right some of these ones will include bonuses like the training that i said for for levi's like little videos on how you can tips and tricks on how you can use this thing right if you have a widget that's like at home health kitchen stuff having videos on how they can actually use the thing in better ways is huge if you have a supplement business for example telling people how to take the products and the best things to combine it with and what time of day and how they can make sure they don't forget it and blah blah those are all
(08:58) things that can be bonuses that can be perceived benefits of doing the thing right and all of this stuff goes back to these variables okay in increasing value and increasing the likelihood somebody wants to buy all right and then finally naming it in a way that i think it will be cool if i said my dream outcome was that i wanted a warm jacket then probably having warm or hot or fire or flames or oven right in the name might be something that would increase my likelihood that i'm thinking this is going to be something that will help me
(09:23) experience my dream outcome right okay now on the flip side if i wanted just something that was fashionable and light then it might be a light fashion jacket right and so it's telling me the dream outcome so we have to be explicit in what we're doing and i'll also bet you right that you'll have different avatars that will be attracted to different things or maybe you same avatar but they're they're solving different needs so the question is what job is are we trying to do what's the job to be done and then everything else is going to
(09:45) fall down from there now amazon specifically people name it based on the things that people search for right which makes sense because why would they do that because it's exactly what i was looking for by naming it properly and so my hope here is that uh this video at least gives you a little bit of a cursory overview of the things that you can do within an e-commerce or physical products business to apply the 100 offer framework to make your stuff more buyable so that people increase in higher amounts at higher percentages and
(10:10) they do so willing to pay higher prices because you have checked all these boxes off and the competitors that you have might even have the same product as you but they haven't increased the perceived likative achievement they haven't shown how demonstrated how they can use the product they don't have guarantees they don't have tribe before you buy it takes two weeks to get there and the purchasing process is a pain in the ass they have to make an entire profile they have to do all the stuff right and they find out that there is no scarcity so as
(10:31) far as they're concerned they can buy this whenever so they can come back next week if they feel like it right and there's no urgency or time timeline where they do it because maybe maybe this is seasonal for for you but for them it's year-round so again they can take even more time to make the decision right and then in terms of bonuses yours comes with all these different trainings and things like that they can and how to use the product and how to use it in different ways and even how to use it for different avatars to solve different
(10:50) problems right because people are going to experience different problems that they're using they're hiring your product to solve right and then of course your competitors calls it jacket and you say like fashion jacket and all of a sudden the person says you know what i think this is exactly what i need and i'm going to buy right that is how you can apply the 100 offers framework including the value equation and the other things that i talk about enhancing value from the book to a physical product business all right so mostly

Launch A Physical Product Brand The Right Way - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvHDT0ZxSmw

Transcript:
(00:00) i get asked all the time about these nose trips that i wear i wear nose strips so that i don't snore at night in this video i'm going to break down how i would launch a no-strip business if i were to launch one and how i would get it to be a 40 to 60 million dollar enterprise and how you can use the same thought process to apply to any physical products business or service business that you use to sell stuff to people that you don't know no strip costs pennies to manufacture you can sell them for a hundred times
(00:26) that price so if it cost you two cents and you can sell for a buck you're making huge margins on the actual thing the second thing is that it's sticky quite literally but also from a recurring standpoint if you can improve how someone breathes they're gonna buy it again and again and again i could have auto ship built into it which would be nice and it makes it convenient for people it's also something that doesn't require willpower to use you don't have to remember to do it like the problem with supplements is that people have to
(00:46) remember to take them most people sleep every day most people don't work out every day and so i'd rather associate a product with something that people are doing on a regular basis without willpower it's the reason beauty products to me are more interesting than fitness products by and large i have deep product knowledge i've used the ones that are like pieces not a huge fan walk around within the morning and i take it out i put in my pocket leave it on my kitchen table out of bed to go get the fit i like the disposable ones and
(01:08) the things that i probably do to make it different is i'd focus a lot on the product i would also probably try and tie in some sort of branding element i would put like volume or persist or endure across the bridge of the nose i'd like to have one that was clear that had the word so the only thing you see is the word which i think would be really cool it has to stick all the way through the different flavors of the nose strips would be the words that people are working on and so i like having those constant daily subconscious reminders
(01:33) around things they actually found in sales rooms that having a single word on the wall affected performance from the team even if it was just huge so if you just have like one more on the wall then everyone sees that as this daily reminder that they need to keep it i would want my face to be the walking billboard for my eye and i would have it spelled backwards said that in the mirror someone could see it and they could see it every day and it would remind people of like a word that they're trying to focus on for a season
(01:55) and so i'll give you a basic estimate of what i think would end up happening money-wise let's say that we retailed the product for let's see what uh some strips go for real quick so they currently sell for about 30 cents a strip and i'd probably sell 30 60 90 packs i would want to be a little bit premium 1999 would probably be a price point that i would look at 24.
(02:12) 99 i would split test the price points there but it'd probably be in that range my cost of goods would almost be entirely based on the shipping cost that's associated cost to ship the no strips would probably be in the neighborhood of like four dollars maybe like two and a half it depends on like the 3pl that we would use even after the cost of all the no strips which is minimal let's just say we make 16 of gross margin on a 20 product which is really good for physical products five options on my upsell one three six twelve all the way down to maybe fifteen
(02:37) percent off if they buy you know twelve months worth and then cascading upwards in terms of smaller percentages off but let's do the math on how much money this would make let's say ten thousand people a month would go to a page if i said hey check this out and if i did it consistently probably about ten thousand people a month just clicks and then we converted five percent of traffic on that page five hundred buyers let's just keep it at the monthly rather than getting in the average bundles ten percent churn and it's not very low for
(02:59) physical but just leave it at that every month i would sign up 500 and then i'd lose 10 percent this business would keep growing with that level of traffic until we reached 5 000 users because it's 500 divided by 10 which is the churn which is the number of maxed out users at a hypothetical max we're in equilibrium between number of signups and number of cancellations i would be at 5 000 users a month price point was 20 100 000 a month 80 000 a month so a million dollars a year in profit from the no strips and if i was focusing on like a
(03:26) branding perspective i would probably go after the entrepreneur community first because it's obviously a community that i have access to the brand would actually be more of a personal development brand of like becoming the person you want to be with the daily actions and reminders of who you want to become because i'd want it to be mass market i would show different walks of life working on different problems moms and their word is patience patience can apply to anyone but like a prisoner who just gets out is the next con it might
(03:50) be like forgiveness it could be a much wider brand if you focus on the deficiencies that people want to fill and then i have to think of some kind of sexy word for the brand name i don't know i feel like it'd be something around like better be better nose trips short and simple that people could understand and share you want it to be about the prospect and more specifically about the problem that we're solving and the person that they want to become and the promises that we're fulfilling if you can help someone feel better about
(04:14) who they are people will pay anything for that feeling and so the wedge product is the idea that we are helping people breathe better but the brand and the promise is about we're helping people be better what i would really want to do is build the capacity to make the words easy to print on there so we could have people put their own custom word in so you can choose from one of my five words but if you want to put your own word in it's 30 and i get this huge premium but it's worth it for a lot of people to have their own custom words so
(04:39) that would be like a unique competitive moat if you develop a manufacturing capacity that can like on demand create the word that someone wants you can literally 2x 3x sometimes the price of the thing because value is there for people and they would get a text they would say hey what word you want to work on this month they text it back it automatically goes into the system and then ships it right out to them and i would probably ship no strips with two or three variations of influencers that i thought were words that their
(05:03) communities dug so someone sends me mozination or someone sends me s me 500 someone sends me those terms on a strip i'm going to be like dude this is dope and then because i have such high gross margins i could say hey man i'll give you 40 by the way if you're making your own business if you ran 40 margin on your own audience it's a great business anyways for me i was able to add a million dollars to business and then you add 100 influencers maybe they're not as big or they're not as no strip centric like i am but maybe if they did a tenth
(05:27) of the volume that i could do on average it's 10 times what i'm doing which is 10 million dollars theirs was only 40 margin to me because i had to give them 40 and there's 20 that was cost so let's cut that in half again so i get another 20 from the 10x volume that i get from them mind you stuff to run the business but let's just keep it simple for now so now we're probably looking at a three or four million dollar ebitda business that is recurring not dependent on one single face very high gross margin so that they
(05:50) can go into new channels that has a unique and competitive moat that allows it to have a premium pricing which i didn't even factor in like if we sold it for 40 rather than 20. that would be a really interesting business model that would have huge enterprise values if you're curious the final piece is that what would this business be worth if we're doing 4 million in ebitda for a physical products business like this this business would probably be worth somewhere in the 40 to 60 million range mosey money business breakdown if i were
(06:12) to get into physical products what i would make and how i would make it to be a cool business it was mostly on the fly

How Billionaires Make Their Billions - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMlbWtUFa4E

Transcript:
(00:00) I didn't understand how to make a billion dollars for a very very long time and the first misunderstanding is that you don't make a billion dollars to become a billionaire you own stuff that's worth a billion dollars to become a billionaire let me walk you through how I used to think this worked so phase one high school Alex was like okay in order to be a billionaire I have to make a billion dollars every year which is ridiculous but that's what I thought the second phase I was like oh silly High School Alex that's not how you make a
(00:27) billion dollars all you have to do is take home a billion $2 billion before taxes over your lifetime and so then third season which is where I'm at right now and you don't make it you own it so let's say you own a business that is making $10 million a year Topline all right now half of that is your profit if this company is worth 10 times its earnings and I'll explain why that like why a company like this might be worth 10 times its earnings after taxes I take home you know three good for me next year cuz I'm in mosy nation and we focus
(00:55) on the main asset that we have our business and I go from $5 million a year in profit to $6 million a year profit doesn't sound like a huge win right it's okay hey added a million bucks bottom line cool this is great well if we have a 10x multiple then something I own went from being worth 50 million to being worth 60 million now I Own 100% of that thing and I just got something that appreciated by 10 million doll that I didn't pay tax on wait a second what I got out of the business only went from 3 to 3.5 million after taxes right six at
(01:23) 40% you get to 3 and a half to take home I only made an extra $500,000 after taxes this year no you made an extra $10 $ million after taxes because the thing that you own appreciated by $10 million and that's the thing that I didn't understand for a very long time and so now let's zoom out you want to be a billionaire again it's not by me side hustling my way to a billion like Zuckerberg didn't have airbnbs he was flipping on the side while he was building Facebook what did you do to become a billionaire he built Facebook
(01:51) if you have the opportunity to spend half of your time obsessing about your passive income rather than saying huh I wonder if I could take my 5 milon profit business focus all my attention on it and make it into a $6 million profit business then all of a sudden I just added $10 million to my net worth and so this is how billion dollars actually is made you have something that makes between $80 and $100 million in iida or fancy word for profit that you get a multiple on and usually companies of that size tend to trade at 15 times
(02:21) earnings like if you look at the S&P all right so you'd really only need somewhere in the a of like $70 million in iida to be a billionaire cuz you own the company so it means that you'd have to make a little bit more than $1.3 million $1.5 million per week in take home which I know that that sounds crazy but like you have to think in increments like imagine how much you made 5 years ago as an entrepreneur how crazy small does that feel to you now because you've leveled up and so as much as whatever number I just said to you might sound
(02:45) like a lot 5 years from now you might be in shooting distance and so it's really just about understanding like how do I reverse engineer what has to happen and if you want to be a billionaire it's like okay well how do I make a million dollars $1.5 million a week in profit well if I'm running a 30% Marg in business I got to make $6 million a week There's 50 2 weeks I got to make $300 million Topline okay so then you can start actually putting tangible goals to this I want to become a billionaire you become a billionaire by owning something
(03:08) worth a billion dollars if you really want to be smart about it you don't shoot for a billion here's why you want to shoot for 10 billion or 50 billion and I know this is going to sound crazy but realistically I would never imagine trying to pursue an opportunity that was capped at $100 million a year you would have to think about opportunities that one were not limited by your time two could serve a very big Marketplace three had very high gross margin and four you'd think probably on a very very long time Horizon and then all of a sudden
(03:34) you're thinking like a billionaire the goals we have matter matter more because of how we measure them and the increments in which we use to build them more than what the actual goal itself is and so when someone tells me they have a goal to make six figures what happens is they're going to think that six figures is the cap they're going to break it down into tiny itty bitty units and they're going to basically say 100% of my effort equals $100,000 and they're going to measure in tiny units and then they're going to do what 100% effort and
(03:57) they're going to be like ah I was at 94 this year but if you're thinking about Mak $10 million then you can you'll thinking like okay for me to make $10 million I got to sell let's say a $10,000 thing and I got to sell $1,000 of them okay that means three $10,000 things a day and if I close one out of three calls that means I have to take nine calls a day okay well how much do I have to spend to get a call for this thing all of a sudden you start thinking in a much bigger increment and if you're like I don't know what I could sell for
(04:21) $10,000 well then you got to figure out something that makes someone else $100,000 and you can sell something that's worth 10 the reason you're not making enough money is cuz you don't know how to provide enough value the reason that like a lot of the wealth in the world sits with Finance years is because they know how to take someone passively and they can say hey man just give me a billion dollars and I'll just make you 10% a year on it and they know how to make 15% a year and they make that extra five on a billion and they
(04:45) take home 50 million a year and they're like works for me if you can approach the problem that way you'll start thinking more along the lines of the people that I think you're trying to emulate you don't make it you own it you get paid for what you do you get Returns on what you own that $50 million business that we were talking about before 10 million 5 million profit 10x why would someone pay 10x for something you're like I wouldn't pay $50 million for business that's making five let me tell you why you would so if that
(05:08) business went from 5 to 6 and then went 20% again cuz that was a 20% growth it went to 7.2 and then 20% again would be 8.6 and 20% again would be what 10.2 you know and keep going if you added all those things up you'd be at 40ish million in earnings over the next 5 years remember we bought it for 50 but wait now we still own the thing and it's is making 125 million in profit wait if we just apply 10x and realistically at this point it probably closer to 12x let's just still apply 10x for this now we have a $125 million thing that we
(05:40) paid 50 for that already paid us 40 back and this is where it gets even juicier to buy that $50 million thing I didn't write a check for 50 I wrote a check for 15 and I took a loan for 35 huh and so then at the end of this whole thing I put my 15 million down I pay back my loan for the $35 so I only have $10 million left over that I got to I got to pay back and now I get 100% of that 125 million minus my original 10 cuz I covered five of it from from the cash flow oh I just made $120 million that's why people do it the smart money if you
(06:11) want to sell to institutional investors they think that way and so you have to think that way about the assets that you own and the assets that you're building that is like ultimately how you can make huge leaps in in wealth

How to go ALL IN on your side hustle... - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SYkwtqFoRcM

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video I'm going to walk through the three-step process of going from side hustle to main hustle so first things first I'm going to define a side hustle as a main hustle that has not gained enough size to support you financially and this is an important delineation because if you're just trying to make side money then to me that's a distraction from what your real main hustle is which is probably your career if you have a career or you have a job then I'm a big advocate of the reason you should have this job is
(00:26) because you're trying to learn and earn and it should be probably geared more towards learning than earning especially in the first decade once you have some of those learnings if you want to just make your own money then you take the skills you have and you have to make your side hustle really your main hustle and my objective here is the number one first secure your family financially which means live underneath of your means with just the income from your job your side hustle will also hopefully start making some income once I have a
(00:56) certain amount of savings which for me would be like six months of living is what I would feel comfort with before starting my next thing and it's exactly what I had when I started my gym I see 50 grand for my consulting job over two years living far under my means only making 50 000 a year in order to have a safety nut to make the next step I'd say fifty thousand dollars and for me I lived on less than that just do the math on your own the next step is that I need my side hustle to at least match my income from my current role now is there
(01:23) an exception to that if for some reason you're only able to work on your side main hustle four hours a week and you're doing half of your income as you're doing in your 40. then I would look at that rate should be like well in four hours I'm making half of what I'm making 40.
(01:38) if I had the other 36 hours back to add to my four would I be able to match that if you can use logic and say yes then I would say I'd feel comfortable making the jump but if you want to be safe which many people were trying to make this jump which is just so you know the single hardest jump in all of Entrepreneurship is going from the safest thing which is a job to being 100 eating what you kill some people are really easy for it it was not easy for me so I want to Stack as many things in my favor to make that at the lowest risk possible that's when I started an online
(02:03) business and I got 20 of my friends to pay me 200 bucks a month each when I started my side hustle I actually started a charity project where I got all my friends to pay me 200 bucks a month to do their Fitness and Nutrition programming from home and I donated all the money they gave me it was about four thousand dollars a month at one point when I decided to transition to my main hustle which is just going to be Fitness I didn't even start my gym yet but it was enough that I could live I just said hey would you guys mind paying me
(02:25) instead of the charity all of them said it was fine and I transformed four thousand dollars a month to charity to four thousand dollars a month of income and that's how I was able to quit my fifty thousand dollar your job for a fifty thousand dollar a year online business and that's what actually gave me my living expenses when I started at my gym while I was reinvesting stuff into hiring more people buying more equipment things like that that I couldn't afford in the beginning the phase three there was that I had seen
(02:46) that they had sustained the level of donations for a six-month period and then when I asked them to go to four payment that was my big risk and they said yes and so then I felt confident that I had sustained this level of income from my side hustle for an extended period of time and that ultimate really gave me the confidence to jump into the new thing and to be fair I actually moved locations during that period of time and dramatically cut my overhead so like I was saving really aggressively but when I wasn't sure the
(03:10) money was going to come in my rent was first zero because it was just the gym but before that just when I got to California I just rented a bedroom from a guy that I met at the gym for 400 bucks a month and he wanted me to live there because he wanted to get fit he gave me that discount and that's I mean use what you got right and so I would meal prep every Sunday with him and so he got a little bit of value from that which I got to have a discounted payment and sometimes he'd chip in on groceries for my food like I've maintained my
(03:36) relationship with that guy for a decade now some of those early people who help you out I think it's always worth remembering them and so for my first phase of saving up I saved fifty thousand dollars making fifty thousand dollars a year over two years which means I was living on like a third of what I could possibly live on at that time because I wanted to save up this nut to go all in on the thing I wanted to do now I didn't know how sustainable that was and this is probably something you might not have thought of is that I
(03:57) want to sustain that level of income for six months all right this is like orders of risk you have the savings you've matched your current income you're living below just one income which means you're banking three quarters what you're getting paid probably and then three is that you've shown that it's reliable because if you just the first month you match your income you quit and then the next month you drop back down to zero or one quarter because you're doing gig work or whatever that's gonna be really stressful it's going to affect
(04:20) the work you do it's gonna affect how you sell and honestly it's gonna affect every other aspect of your life and so I would want to see consistency what side hustle do you pick I want the side hustle to be something that I have a high likelihood of success with which is something that I have some sort of experience with one of the easiest things to do is take whatever you're doing in your current role is start doing that as a contractor 1099 Etc do those companies have the most Enterprise Value no but you can make some money and
(04:44) learn some basic skills in business that you would have no other opportunity to learn you'll learn how to hire people you learn how to fire people learn how to have hard conversations learn how to drive initiatives you learn how to Market you learn how to sell to get new business you learn how to contracted invoice you learn how to process payments learn how to set up an LLC there's lots of things that you have to learn just going zero to one now if you have a longer time rise and do that you'll figure those out as you go but I
(05:04) would say that you don't need to be perfect on the first pick you just need to be directionally correct and the first direction is I'm going to be an entrepreneur so if you make the first jump you've already taken the biggest jump in the right direction of what you ultimately want to do it is very very very rare that long-term entrepreneurs first business is their last business look at every single person that you look aspire to and look up to in the business world with the exception of Zuck and basis the thing that they
(05:29) started is not the thing that was their biggest thing Andy frisella had some direct response brick and mortar store thing and he was like painting Lanes in parking lots I think Ed my lap was like selling Insurance stuff I was doing personal training online what you start with is not what you're going to end with but it will give you the stepping stones that are necessary to get to the higher leverage opportunity in my opinion one of the bigger mistakes people make is they try and go to the big leagues before they're ready and
(05:54) then they fall flat be willing to do the basics because realistically I'm probably not besos I probably not Zuckerberg and you might not be either and that's okay and so you don't necessarily need to model their path you can model one that decreases the risk because besos had a Wall Street Finance job at a hedge fund he didn't need to worry about money and if he quit he could go right back to the hedge fund and make probably a million dollars a year Zuck was a Harvard grad Dropout whatever he could get a job if it failed
(06:18) at any top tech company immediately and if you don't have those prospects you need to be in my opinion a little bit more respectful of the risk that you're taking on and if you're a kid and you can live at home or you can live with four buddies do that if you can get your living expenses to be so little that you can cover it with part-time work like if you can bounce at a club on the weekends for two days and you get the other five days back I think that's a net win but the biggest part of this is like how much overhead do I have to cover in my
(06:43) life that I'm burning hours on the thing I don't want to do long term to do the thing I do want to do long term massively cut your overhead so that you get as much of your time back to invest in the thing that you want to do most

I Gained 5,000,000+ Followers with this Secret Method - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fd-hi3NqMYo

Transcript:
(00:00) I'm about to teach you a rarely used method that I use to grow my Audience by 5 million people in under 24 months and the crazy thing is is 24 months ago I had less than 10 000 followers and I knew nothing about YouTube Tick Tock Instagram Twitter or any of these other platforms and the reason that I was able to catapult to you know a top one percent Creator in that 24 month period is using this method that for some reason no one really talks about whenever I enter a new space whether it's trying to learn a new skill a new
(00:30) platform a new anything I realized there's a massive amount of skill deficiency that I have to overcome as fast assembly possible and so I can either deploy time or I can deploy money to save myself time so within the world of organic content I was like who can I pay to shortcut my path to getting to where they are so on one hand I could go to like celebrities and I did go to some of them and they would give me their strategies but it was like very personalized and tailored to them and I didn't think it would apply to like how
(00:56) I run acquisition.com in my daily life on the other hand there was like the coaches gurus Etc that I could go to and I didn't want to do that because they might be using something that worked like five years ago which honestly I see all the time they're like guys you've got to do hashtags on YouTube videos I'm like what are you talking about like this that's that's not true and the third option which I ultimately went with are advertising agencies and what an agency is is just a business that sells Services of advertising on your
(01:22) behalf I can pay someone to run ads for me I can pay someone to cut edit and distribute content on my behalf so what I want to do is help you decide whether or not you should use an agency and avoid what I call the agency trap there's different tiers of agencies there's the guys who just make stuff and then there's the people who are real pros contextually here for one brand on one platform a small one might cost three-ish maybe five thousand a month the more advanced ones are usually in the 15 to 30 000 a month so it's
(01:50) significantly more money so here's how I use agencies now and how you can too phase one is I get what I would consider a basic agency so long from getting into YouTube the first step I didn't was I hired three to five thousand dollar a month agency and they just got me to commit to doing three videos a week they just trimmed it which means you take out the oohs and Oz put an intro and a thumbnail the main objective of that first phase was just to get the basics down forcing me to create content on a regular cadence once I have more context
(02:15) because I spent three six months working with them seeing what the audience likes then I'm like okay now I want to learn everything so I go from beginner of learning the basics and doing the fundamentals to how do the top creators create on this platform no business owner should change their business for one client and so it makes sense for both me and the small agency or for you in a small agency to part ways at some point when your demands for what you want exceed their capacity so then I work with the much better more advanced
(02:44) agency who works with the top creators to learn all of the more nuanced pieces of the platform so rather than agree to their initial terms which is basically pay us as long as humanly possible and we hope you pay until you die this is exactly what I say gather round I want to do what you do in my business but I don't know how I'd like to work with you for six months so I can learn how you do it plus I'll pay extra for you to break down why you make the decisions you do and the steps you take to make them then after I get a good
(03:11) idea of how it all works I'll start training my team on it and once they can do it well enough I'd like to change to a lower cost Consulting agreement this way you can still help us if we run into problems are you opposed to this when you start that way I like it because you're starting with very clear intentions and you're saying hey I'm going to commit to six months this is what I want from you and I'm also saying I'm going to continue to pay you after the engagement's over for a much higher leverage much more profitable Consulting
(03:33) engagement so that's what a lot of agencies would ultimately want and if I need to pay a little bit more than the agency fee up front then I'm willing to do that I also understand that as I start to train my team on internally there will be a period of time where I'm paying both them and my team so you're paying twice the thing is is that when you do that you're actually building the Enterprise value of your business and you're building the asset that you own rather than being reliant on somebody else who eventually could if you wanted
(03:57) to cut you off and then you'd be dead in the water or what more realistically happens is they gouge you and they continue to raise the price because they can see how much money you're making from the thing with that new agency we ran the same play hey we want to learn from you we want to understand why you're picking these things we want to understand the decision making process Etc I start documenting what they're doing into our processes internally we want to start co-creating so they're making stuff for us and we're making
(04:23) stuff for us and eventually our stuff for us starts to be as good and eventually better than the stuff that they make for us and it should be because I'm only one client of many to them and I'm basically renting them as fractional labor with expertise at a premium once your team has the same amount of expertise or more they should be better because one they have more time because they're going to fully allocate their time to you and secondly because they will always have more context on your brand than an agent will
(04:49) by having more time and more context all we have to fill is the gap of expertise and so once we have the expertise Gap then the in-house team should be better than the Advan its team and then at that point you decouple and you let them go you want to make sure that you have a clear deadline for when you want to make that transition and this is good for a couple reasons one is because it sets expectations with them they can also see the LTV and you can talk in terms of that let's say it's six thousand dollars
(05:13) a month I'm committing to thirty six thousand dollars all right so like you're gonna get that for me as long as you're not an idiot but the real real is that your team also knows that you're like Hey we're one month down we got to understand this stuff in five months hey we're two months down we've got to understand this stuff in four months and so it drives you towards the outcome of getting your team up to speed faster now you have that deadline but what if your team's not as good as theirs by the time the deadline comes well in my opinion
(05:34) you either need to change the people or they're not teaching you everything that needs to happen because if they're low-skilled people are doing better than your team some who is a problem either them or you let's assume that the people are right and limit just a more complex platform whatever I keep going until our team matches theirs once our team match is theirs then I drop it off we downgraded to a Consulting agreement just for insurance one or two months later if we feel like we're not learning anything on the calls that we have from
(05:56) a Consulting perspective we cut it and we do so amicably because we set that as the expectation that's how I grew my YouTube so now let's approach the same concept but on a different platforms I didn't understand Tick Tock at all I didn't use it I wasn't on it I actually had an agency reach out to me how about which is not common for me to accept that but they said listen you do no work so from a value perspective the offer was we you already have enough content out there I can repurpose it and make shorts out of it I was like okay sure if
(06:21) you want to do all the work and involve me at nothing and just make content for me sounds good and so that's what they did and they started getting traction with the short videos and we're like okay this stuff works and then for me my director of brand actually had a super deep history on short form content and so normally I would have had that second phase where I would go for that premium agency but that individual worked at a premium agency and so I actually bought the Sops automatically and we were able
(06:48) to massively scale our output on short content within six or so months of working with that original agency and again we're on good terms with the person in the agency if you set the expectation up front which is I want to learn from you and I want to be transparent about my intentions and I want to eventually bring this in-house because it's my belief that my team will be able to allocate more time to my thing and understand my brand better and if they had your skills they will be able to do more output at higher quality
(07:11) than you could ever do you have to make a margin I don't I'm going to cover cost and get five times more output this is what I believe has married the best parts of agency and the best part of building an Enterprise and making a valuable business and avoided the agency traps so many people fall into myself included so the first agency experience I ever had was actually really good I then worked with like 10 more agencies and all of them were terrible and this is the exact process of what happened so reading directly from 100 million dollar
(07:38) leads step one they got me excited about all the new leads they would bring step two I'd go through an onboarding process that felt valuable and sometimes was step three they assigned their best senior rep to my account step four I saw some results step five they moved my senior rep to the newest customer step six a junior rep starts managing my account my results suffer so seven I complained step eight the senior rep would come back once in a while to make me feel better step nine the results still never got back to where they were
(08:06) before and I'd eventually cancel step 10 I'd search for another agency and repeat the cycle of insanity Step 11 for the zillionth time start wondering why I wasn't getting results like the first time so how do you decide if using the agency is right for you first off do you have more money or more time if you don't have any money then you got to learn it and it's going to take time and you know what that's part of life usually you master one platform you get some success you get a little bit cash flow and then
(08:28) you can more quickly pay to learn the other ones you pay down your ignorance tests faster if you have the money then for me it's always worth paying on that debt and that process is how we approached LinkedIn how we approach podcasts how we approach paid ads all of them I run the same Playbook

The 8 Laws of Business I Learned From Charlie Munger - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C_SgvSvJZdk

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on everyone my name is alex ramose i'm the ceo and founder of allen prestige labs gym lunch and we own a portfolio of other companies who've done 120 plus million in the last four years in this video what i want to do is show you the eight principles charlie monger taught me to succeed in business and life and uh by no means am i saying that i have completely executed all these things in my life these are just aspirational things that i think benefit most humans those of you who know me i'm a huge a
(00:28) huge fan i've consumed a lot of his materials and so i wanted to consolidate his speeches and his his work into these principles for anyone who's kind of new to charlie munger and so i'm not going to do these in order i'm going to do these in the order that i think it makes the most sense to present them the first one is invert always invert and so he references johnny carson in one of his speeches to always try and solve problems in reverse and this has been something that's been immensely powerful i think because for
(00:59) us using thinking frameworks in order to make decisions in order to solve problems as both you know entrepreneurs business people and then just just in daily life so many times we try and solve it logically going forward towards it and it gives you this entirely fresh perspective to start at what you don't want and then try and solve from that direction and that'll kind of lead way into the other eight excuse me the other seven of the lessons and at the very end i'll give you the one the one thing that i if just from the the things that we've done
(01:29) that i would add uh to the list that has been really helpful for us or rather things to avoid so his first thing that you hear him talk about all the time is just don't ingest chemicals to alter your state right he's like i've never heard of someone like if i wanted to be really poor or really unsuccessful in life what would i do he's like well i would definitely get addicted to chemicals right and so this sounds so logical like obvious to us but instead so many of us uh still use that stuff on a regular basis to alter our mood because we can't
(01:58) cope with some of the issues that are coming up in our lives he's like i can't imagine anyone who's thought to themselves man my life is so much better now that because i because i do drugs and because i i drink and i'm not saying that you know that's a judgment in any way it's just one of the principles that he's found to be a successful trait for himself and others number three envy so one of the things that's been a gift for warren buffett and charlie monger together is this statement that they made both of them
(02:27) being you know super billionaires and they said every single year someone is doing better than us and for me that was so like like uh gut wrenching is the wrong word but like that hit me because i think i am so i am innately so competitive that i suffer from comparison all the time i was actually texting a friend this morning who's also a you know multiplayer deck of billionaire and he was saying he's like i feel like the more money i make the poorer i feel and it's totally true because what ends up happening is that your your measuring
(02:58) stick changes i remember you know when i when i was really really young my measuring stick for money was chipotle burritos it was just how many triple-a burritos does this amount of money equate to and so i actually think that we have like a stick or a unit that becomes our base unit when we're measuring wealth for ourselves and that's why when i think i had a hundred thousand dollars in my bank account that was probably the wealthiest i have ever felt because i had proportional to what my measuring stick was which at that time was still
(03:22) meals a hundred thousand dollars was so much so much money so many of those units at this point in my life a million dollars is kind of my measuring unit that i use as a base unit for how many how many of these do i have in this how many how many you know how many sticks do i have in you know real estate how many sticks i have in in in my portfolio how much do i have in equity in these companies etc and so that stick changes but someone is always doing better but i think it's so much more about not thinking about them
(03:50) because the way that they roll the dice and play the game has no effect on us and so simply it's an imaginary way to make yourself suffer so if you want to suffer definitely be envious of people the fourth one was definitely resent people like really hold on to resentment if you want to be miserable and so one of the stories that charlie tells us of a king who committing trying to not be resentful of people what he would do is every time he'd want to resent someone he'd write their name down and he'd put it on a slip of paper in a drawer and
(04:19) periodically he'd go to that drawer open it up and read the names and realize how life had dealt with those people without him having to do anything and so i think it's one of those long-term mindedness that like most people live in karmic balance independent of whether or not you believe in you know that kind of woo stuff but simply like people who do bad things eventually that catches up to them and it is worse for them and so you like someone who exists in that state is already dealing with the suffering of
(04:45) being who they are and so you know if you want to be miserable definitely resent people the next one is uh be unreliable right like if you want to definitely be miserable like be unreliable say you're going to do something and don't do it say you're going to be somewhere and and be late be flaky make commitments that you don't keep and this one is one of those ones that he references a lot of times as he's like if you just get this one right and you are reliable it's very difficult to be miserable it's very difficult to be unsuccessful and there
(05:15) was a guy that i was that i knew in high school and this is when i had a you know a bigger ego than i have now and i was such a so i was such a dick i honestly i was just there's no other way to say it i just was and this kid was just like he stayed he went to all the extra credit for for teachers he worked so hard and he had nothing going for him like he wasn't like the best looking kid he wasn't athletic like he didn't have like this natural processing power he wasn't quick like that but i remember and i was such a mean guy
(05:46) to this kid and i remember one time he we got in some sort of spat and i was like in what world will you ever be better than me at anything and i remember saying that you can you can feel it's so dripped in ego and it's just kind of disgusting but anyways i said this to him and he ended up getting into a better college than me i ended up going to vanderbilt he ended up going to duke and i just remembered that moment because it was such a deep lesson for me that like he was more reliable than i was he was more long-suffering than i
(06:12) was he was more consistent than i was he showed up to every teacher's thing he showed ups he did all the extra credit he did all the homework he he like he did all those things and he just showed up and that was a huge lesson for me that i was like if i can just show up like that guy does like man things will open up for me but if you want to fail definitely be unreliable the next one is overspend your income you know definitely if you want to get if you want to if you want to put yourself in a horrible situation
(06:38) on a regular basis and consistently have stress definitely spend more than you make which you know america is doing right now with their own gdp but we won't even get into that but definitely overspend what you make like don't save you know spend more than what you have always have bigger aspirations than you have the ability to fulfill on and definitely always live in debt and the wrong kind of debt the bad debt and so if you've any followed any of my stuff my my i'm a huge proponent of living broke all the time
(07:04) and it's because i believe wealth is a ratio between income and expenses it's not a number right if you can live on one percent of what you make as a hypothetical example then you are in you are infinitely wealthy because you already have a hundred times more your income is a hundred times more than your expenses which means you could live veritably for a hundred years and so just on one year's income so that's an extreme example just to illustrate the point but if you like for me i feel less and less anxiety the the greater the
(07:32) percentages of excess i have in my expenditures versus how i live and so there's two ways to get there one is you can increase how much you make the other ways you can decrease how much you spend but the thing is is no matter where you are right now the one that you can immediately change is how much you spend over time you can use those that those extra funds invest in yourself grow the top line so that you can even make that discrepancy crazier so that your wealth can increase that ratio being your wealth can increase
(07:57) and so for me i try and live on ten percent that that hundred thousand dollar story that i gave you earlier once i was i had a million dollars in my bank account i still lived on thirty thousand dollars a year and so i was you know i was living on three percent um at that point of my wealth but my income was was already surpassing a million dollars a year at that point and so i was living on three percent of what i was taking home and honestly i felt so free because i just knew that i had way more money than i would ever need that's
(08:24) very freeing so but if you want to fail definitely overspend your income the next one is learn only from your own mistakes right don't learn from the mistakes of others don't learn from other people's successes and what i want to add as a wrinkle to this is that depending on where you're at in your journey this is something that i've observed is um you in the very very beginning you have no value to offer i get messages frequently of people being like hey uh let's start a business together i'll give you half and i'm like well you're
(08:52) providing no value i'm the one who would know how to run this business so this is not a good trade for me you know return on my time is not very good another one is i'll work with you you know i'll work for you for free you know if you teach me everything and i was like yeah that's so i'm getting someone who has no skills and no value and exchange you're getting an education from someone you know like that's not a fair that's not a good exchange for me right and so what you have to do is find ways where even that you can trade your
(09:17) base level which is time for someone who has a need for that level of skill who's ahead of you and that's where like small businesses like if someone's making a hundred thousand a year or two hundred thousand dollars a year in a business that's not a very big business but if you if you say i will work for free for you then someone like that can still use for lack of a better term just hands right someone who can just help and just be there as a body and i know that may sound diminutive towards you but if you have no base skills that is that is your
(09:44) base skill that you have is you have your time in your hands right and so you use that and then you can learn some more skills and then from that point you develop the next level which is where you can start affording coaches right from the level above that when i say learning only from your own mistakes first is you learn from people for free by exchanging your time then you learn from coaches then you can learn from mastermind such as people where you are now at this point equal with other people in the room who are
(10:08) good and what i will tell you is this if you're at eight figures i'm switching gears in terms of who i'm talking to but as you go up this journey how you network and learn from others changes it evolves and you know i i went the coach route for the first you know three four years of my entrepreneurial journey and then it was much more towards the mastermind route later on but the thing is is once we passed eight figures for us in terms of yearly revenue and yearly income it's shifted to being much more about networking and advisors so that's kind
(10:38) of two different things networking is like other people who are at that level that you just network with and you meet at things and you donate to same charities that kind of thing and the other aspect is like well if you want someone ahead of you at that point a lot of times a you can still get it from the network sometimes but if you really want to get a lot from someone you need to make sure that there's some sort of exchange that's fair and that's where kind of advisory relationships work really well and so i have an
(11:00) advisor and that means that you know they get a minority percentage and something that you guys are working on and so they have an incentive to teach you some of these elements and you at this point you're already proven as an effective person you have the character traits of being reliable you know not being envious having long suffering having the abilities to execute so they know that they can just drop the information in and then it will be incorporated and then they can succeed with you and then the final aspect is what i
(11:26) would say the highest level is heroes because a lot of people we don't have access to you know what i mean even this video right now like i don't know charlie munger i have not met charlie munger but charlie munger is a hero of mine and so i feel like i've been directly mentored by charlie despite the fact that i've never met the man and so i'm eternally grateful for man because he's you know significantly changed my life for the better which will naturally lead me to the his last point and then i'll give you
(11:52) the one that i would add um just from my own experience in my life so his last point would be quit when you have your third or fourth big failure in life he said so if you want to if you want to fail and you want to be miserable you should definitely quit soon quit early right he's like because no matter who you are you're going to fail not just once or twice or three times or four times but you will fail many times and if you if you quit early then you can guarantee that you will be you know miserable for a very long time uh after
(12:17) that because then you have given up hope and you'll have nothing to strive towards you'll have no purpose and so if you want to be miserable definitely quit early right and even count count the amount of times you failed because because for some reason that means something right it doesn't mean anything and so to wrap this up i'll give you alex's one that's been tremendously helpful for me which is this is kind of started from a speech i heard one of the presidents say um from the past but was the the way to be successful is to be able to handle
(12:49) pressure right so if you want to if you want to if you want to fail definitely crack under pressure like no matter what happens just crack under pressure crack when people need you and so um my my candid solution for this are the things that have helped me is understanding a what it is which is most of us just create arbitrary expectations and then crumble under pressures that we put on ourselves that don't actually exist in the world we literally create things to weigh ourselves down which i feel like the further along you
(13:18) get into the entrepreneurial game it becomes headier and headier because you realize it's so much just about the limits that you imply you place on yourself and so here's three strategies that i have used that are mentally have that have mentally made me much more resilient the first and i got this from from trevor who got it from epictetus which is ancient philosopher is negative visualization and so let me give you a tactical example of that this is a simple example so i just spent a couple hundred dollars on a shirt and i really
(13:46) like the shirt and i don't really spend money a lot on on clothing um and after i washed the shirt it was like messed up i'll just put it simply right this is a simple example to illustrate and and then he had just taught me about this negative visualization the day before and he said take something that happens negative and then imagine it happening a thousand more times in a row how would you feel in the thousandth time and i thought to myself if every time i washed a shirt you know it shrunk like this or something or it became rougher
(14:17) around the edges and i got it because it was soft i probably wouldn't care that much it would just be like oh that's just how these things are and so it means is that my expectations would change in my mind to what they to match reality and then at that point my misery would disappear and so that's literally what i did in the moment and i felt myself just stopped caring about this thing that actually bugged me a little bit because i was like man that's annoying but you can use that same concept with any of the things that
(14:41) occur in your life when it's like man my my my wife said this thing well what if she said that thing a thousand times in a row you'd be like well i guess that's just kind of how how she is or that's just kind of how things are and then all of a sudden you would acclimate it but you can rapidly force the acclimation to stress by visualizing it happening thousands of times and then skipping to the end because if you can feel that way after a thousand times then you might as well feel that way after the first time and
(15:04) that has been so powerful for me because we have so many stressors that come in our lives and we set expectations that we're even not aware that we're setting and then get underperformed on the second thing that's been really helpful for me is that if i want to start a new behavior or i'm trying to do something that is difficult then what i want to do is go into it and expect the worst and let me give you a real that sounds obvious but let me give you a realistic reasoning for this so let's say that you want to start
(15:29) working out mentally prepare yourself for the fact that every time i work out i'm going to be tired every time i work out i'm going to not be motivated and that's just going to be my base reality if i happen to be motivated or i happen to not be exhausted or i happen to not have a lot of work to do then then that's just a bonus it's serendipitous it's just a happy coincidence but i expect that every time i work out i will be tired i'll have more things to do and i will not you know be motivated to do so and if i come in with that expectation
(16:01) and i set that as my baseline then i am not surprised when i go to work out and i feel that way because then it is in alignment with the expectations that i have in my mind the third of the sub subtext of uh you know creating false expectations and crumbling under pressures that we create for ourselves um is one that is will probably be controversial for some of you but this is a belief that i hold and it has been immensely powerful for me in terms of increasing my joy in life which is elon musk i heard him talk a
(16:31) while back about how he said eventually the universe will expand infinitely until everything becomes a fine mist everything just becomes a fine mist if you extend the time horizon long enough and for me that means that everything that we create on earth and as humanity will eventually disappear so the skyscrapers the books that i write the people that we help people who remember us the legacy that we are trying to have after we die even that will eventually turn into a fine mist and not matter and for me that is so immensely powerful because
(17:07) it means that nothing matters and at the same time it means that we get to choose what things we we create meaning with and so i believe our brains are simply meaning making machines and i love that term so i'm giving it to you is that just i have this meaning making machine in my mind which everything has no meaning and then i can choose to highlight aspects that i i will create meaning for and so understanding that the millions that i have maybe the billions that i'll make in my lifetime and the wealth that i accumulate the
(17:38) reputation the books that impact all of that stuff will eventually disappear truly it will eventually be gone there will be a day where no one knows that i existed or anything like that in some ways it frees me in the present knowing that everything that i do will eventually mean nothing and so all of us are essentially in my mind you know there's the nazi concentration camps uh people would dig holes and then they'd fill holes back up again and it was it was basically meaningless work but it was only meaningless because they
(18:07) believed that it was meaningless right but essentially all of us in my own mind and my understanding of reality are simply just digging holes every day that will eventually when the time horizon is long enough get filled back with dirt and so what that means is imagine i was in that same concentration camp for example which might be an analogy for life and instead of being given a shovel to dig holes they said you can do whatever you want but at the end of your life you have to undo it all right well then i could probably ha i could
(18:40) probably engineer a fairly joyful experience for myself because i would do things that are stimulating for me that i find enjoyable right and so by doing that it just removed all of the expectations and a lot of the envy that i have for other people because i know that all of us in the end there's no box that we take with us right and so that's just been just wildly impactful for me as a human being and in terms of decreasing pressure in my life in business there's just nothing that's that big of a deal right because eventually all of
(19:12) it's going to disappear anyway so if someone's upset with you it's like well you know we're all going to become a fine mist in the future eventually you know like ah you know we've got this competitor who's who's talk stealing our stuff you know we're all going to disappear into a fine mist eventually and that has been so calming for me and has relieved so much pressure for me mentally that may be depressing for some people for me it's wildly freeing and so um i guess if it's depressing for you then don't think
(19:38) about it but if if that resonates with you then then maybe you can use that as a weapon in your arsenal to defend against the pressures that we inevitably put on ourselves that we can deconstruct and deflate and so anyways those are the lessons that i have learned from charlie munger as my hero and mentor uh from consuming so much of his content i hope you found value in that if you are you know if you're a business owner i make a lot of more tactical things about how to make money and all that stuff on this channel if you like

Behind the Scenes of The $100M Leads Launch [Ep 006] - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qel9bf653Es

Transcript:
(00:00) there's a lot of things that can go wrong in launching something like this you have half a million people so you can look in a skyscraper look all the way around Baltimore and be like more than everyone I can see with my eyes has registered for this event I've been prepping for the presentation for two weeks all day every day I will not be the person who did not prepare and I will do that work out of respect for everyone else's attention offers was a meta example meaning the book and the course and everything it was was
(00:30) purposely intended to be an offer so good people would feel stupid saying no the book itself was an example of the concept of the book so 100 leads is different in that I want the example for the book not to be around the offer but around how we promote the book about how we got leads which is why this event was so important to use all the different advertising methods to promote the book like I could have just made a post to my audience about the book and sold plenty of copies and not needed to do warm Outreach or do Affiliates or do paid ads
(00:56) what's the point of this meeting what problem are we solving the most expensive cost in almost all companies is meetings that was supposed to be an hour-long meeting and we got off in 28 minutes so what problem are we solving the second is who's required to solve it if we know what the decision is then it's like I'm not needed so yeah it'll be on Shopify reason we did on Shopify was because um there's a bunch of issues with Amazon done for launching but the main one was that they wouldn't accept the amount of books that we thought we
(01:18) would sell Amazon limits any new book usually to five thousand or ten thousand heart backs and we had a pretty strong suspicion that we were going to sell a lot more than that so for that reason we basically fronted all the money did all the prints because we're self-published so we're housing and we're shipping it where we're housing it I don't like anyone owning my stuff and so whenever you publish a boat you actually sell the rights to your content kind of like musicians where they sell their music to a label same concept for me to like give
(01:42) you guys like a free chapter so the fact that offers was 1.99 those are all things that a normal publisher wouldn't want me to do because that's where they would make their money I want every person there to watch this presentation and be like I need to [ __ ] work harder like if that's like the deepest takeaway from this whole thing then like I can die pretty happy I mean most people spend their entire lives not being able to like influence 500 000 people and so like it's not lost on me [Music] my birthday [ __ ] it yeah good morning
(02:11) thank you appreciate it yes Trevor is probably the closest thing to her brother to me honestly we co-wrote the books I I get a disproportionate amount of credit but Trevor has definitely been the one that has helped me beat up every single idea he's been in a really involved in my life for a long time now and um I hope we can grow old and crotch it together welcome everyone to my book launch event I'm so pumped to have you guys here I promise I have spent a very long time time to compress days and weeks and kind of like a stand-up
(02:38) routine a standard routine that 60 Minutes has taken nine months to perfect like each 30 second bit that strung together created an hour and so it's kind of the same way with this presentation is that like it's zillions of hours compressed into that and that's why hopefully the value per second will just be like incredibly High my first presentations it was just like a few words and then I would talk at the slide over time and then I started adding more like bullets and text to slide and then I watched this presentation actually
(03:04) changed my life it's a 15 minute Ted Talk it was called like Death by PowerPoint it actually like forever changed how I made presentations which is like one idea per slide but then I got from the marketing and sales world to pair the idea with a visual yeah I just wanted to work that's all I want for my birthday is that all the tech works that's it I just want the links to work I want the page to work I want the processing to work there's a huge amount of like Aussies and new zealanders who are staying up as
(03:34) like entrepreneur parties so cool yeah I know so I've got a bunch of guys who have like you know one thousand two thousand person communities that are helping each other up for the event thank you let's see what we got going on pre-set up for tomorrow check this out this is the 360. wow when I dropped the offer people will probably lose their minds I have stacked it for like 17 minutes I just want to show the reaction so the stack is a direct sales tactic that has been proven so many times across so many industries that it is
(04:10) effective the goal for this presentation was to be remembered and so if I wanted someone to have an emotional experience going through this then I have to subvert the audience in a way I think that the stack accomplished that basically making a movie yeah basically Zack Snyder all right well okay rock and roll please what are the things that can go wrong right now I really want me to go wrong is what we can't control okay yeah just like zoom in general [Music] it's the big day Yeah tomorrow's a big day today is my birthday honestly I'm
(04:49) just excited for you guys to tear into it it's not even the event I'm excited for the post that happened one day two day three days four days later after people have consumed you know read the book cover to cover and read it a second time and started going through the course and listened to the audiobook that's what I'm more excited about but tomorrow is the first step to that and uh I'll see you then how many children we have we have over 100 000 in the check-in and currently on the feed 66.
(05:18) cool I'm ready damn right Nigeria Bulgaria Philly Pakistan super cool they're coming in international baby yeah around the world just melts and melts it just puddles so the nose trip said V1 of zero for the last however many months our team has used one-of-one content as kind of our concept which is the only way we say things that only you can say and show things only you can show then as the team started to find out all the things that we're going to be releasing and giving away and doing what no one else would do the team said in the chat dude
(05:56) this isn't even one of one this is one of zero what are you doing that no one will do and I think that raises the bar a lot more I am scared by that bar but I like that bar as an ideal to strive towards we're at 10 minutes you ready gonna be a ride twists and turns on this roller coaster Layla's so worried she's like wait you changed something it's like oh yeah I'm excited to see the reactions because there's gonna be 15 minutes of suspense where they're like is he gonna sell something right now what the good news
(06:27) is I have done this before a lot of times a lot of times I know how much work I put into it when you're in front of the crowd the only person's confidence who matters is yours there are men of talent and Men of preparation I prefer to be the latter so little did I know that as soon as I stepped on stage uh like three massive Tech issues uh break behind the scenes based on the sheer volume of clicks that were going at the same time to the same page let's get some leads is everything running smooth I think a lot of people have any issues
(07:04) with a low price we had 562 000 link Clicks in a matter of like 60 seconds whenever you have something like that it's going to put stress on systems that is very hard to test for you can run simulators which we had and we still had more people than the infrastructure could handle I would send them to YouTube so here's it so 140 000 people or so were not able to get in the team pivoted on the Fly and provided the YouTube link and we had another 40 or 50 000 people who made it over on that side people can talk on their mice
(07:33) in the zoom room yeah the second thing was that there were some Zoom rooms that the master Zoom thing wasn't set up the right way so that they they could like unmute themselves rather than like webinar presenter format now we ended up quickly fixing that well expensively voting for people now the YouTube live stream ended up being three minutes delayed and those were very three important minutes during the uh the entire launch event and so we were able to save 40 000-ish people on YouTube but during that first five or so
(08:00) minutes there was a lot of hustle and bustle trying to figure out what we were going to do to house literally a city of people so you're gonna get lead magnet Mastery you're gonna get the first five client framework Playbook you're gonna have the referral Playbook and you're gonna get the affiliate Playbook and the zero to 100 million dollar scaling roadmap from someone who's actually been there total value 1276.
(08:23) I could see the comments the whole time and I say this with absolute confidence I will bet that you cannot see that I can see the comments in how I was presenting how much is double your lead flow worth an extra 10 000 a year an extra 50 000 hundred thousand year you knew that everyone would turn on me for a brief moment all I could think is like this is going exactly how I want it I'm not going to ask for 12 1076 even though it'd be totally reasonable and a bargain I'm not going to ask for four thousand nine hundred ninety seven dollars I'm
(08:52) not even asked for two thousand nine hundred ninety seven dollars I'm gonna give you access to everything we talked about today for a single payment of [Music] taking the extra four seconds five seconds when the world is watching I wanted to sit in it and just hold and just like kind of enjoy the moment a single payment of I know what they don't know and I believe that that's how some of the best sales presentations are supposed to be I went from villain to hero in 10 seconds it's free we're already almost halfway on Adam
(09:40) looking good oh thank you thanks sweetie um I appreciate it there were some dark days in the middle of the stack there you gotta touch the bottom of the pool that's what makes it memorable despite all the hate that I was getting I knew the rubber band was going to snap back the moment they saw the truth they just had to wait roller coaster ride [Music] you have no idea like I was so nauseous I think I am gonna throw off I think that more people trust us now to continue to keep our promises in a world that breaks them and more people believe
(10:19) us when we say we are a long-term focused because we didn't take the 50 million dollar payday right there was one comment was actually my favorite comment on all the ones that I that I saw you could have made bank but you chose to make history and I thought that was like that was the [ __ ] point like in a statement that was the point good job that was just only two years of Our Lives just about a hundred thousand books sold the first day so offers just sold just under 500 000 copies over two years to sell a hundred thousand in a
(10:49) day was pretty cool to sell 20 of offers of sold big shoes to fill but I actually think that lease with some more copies that offers us and I think that's because more people perceive they have the problem of not having leads than not having an offer the aftermath we're not even done the first week because I'm recording this but my name was trending on all of Twitter the leads audiobook is seven on all of Amazon we went from 50 to 26 on all podcasts we're number one in entrepreneurship we're number two in business like I'm actually like
(11:17) emotional about it something that has never been done before I actually truly believe that what he just did with this launch is going to just have shock waves do you agree with people that are saying that you changed the industry if we're defining change the industry as many people will act differently in terms of how they do business afterwards then I would say yes not everyone but certainly some people will the people who have longer time Horizons who want to build bigger more lasting businesses for sure a brand is based on the
(11:49) associations that people make I knew that having a massive historic event and having the thing still be more valuable than everyone else's and free was something that I wanted to associate myself with but if you measure on a one-year time Horizon then it will never make sense it's cool this is very cool I just want to say thank you guys so much for coming out it means the world to me it's one of those like very small things that Trevor and I spent two years writing this book I just want to say thank you it means a lot to us
(12:23) at the end of the day I will die and on a longer time Horizon I will be forgotten and the only thing that I can say that helped that might be Eternal is skills and education that I can pass on to other people Trevor used to tell me when I was going through kind of like harder times with the edits because it was very tough to edit this book and write this book he said there's a 17 year old who's going to sleep with this book under his pillow to get out of this situation you owe it to him and that's what was kind of like the continuously
(12:47) reinforcing mental frame that I had to that would pull me through it

The Copy Rule I Learned From The Best Copywriter I Know - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OyGKFhTf0go

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on everyone i wanted to share the rule of one with you that i learned from michael masterson and if you haven't heard of michael masterson he's uh the the chief growth uh strategist at agora publishing which to my knowledge is the biggest information seller on the market they do over a billion dollars here in revenue and he is the person who created their entire acquisition machine which is teams and teams of hundreds of copywriters who generate demand through compelling words and i think there's something really magical
(00:32) about that because he not only has been able to do it himself and hit home run after home run out of her home run offer but he's been able to duplicate it in other people and create and get people who've never sold a thing to writing copy that generates 20 million 40 million 80 million plus just from a single letter or message and in his book great leads the first concept that he introduces is arguably the most important and he calls it the rule of one and i've been i it was so important to me that i wrote it down and i have it right on
(01:02) front of my computer because it applies to almost everything but especially to communication and sales messages and so whenever he said the common thing that most copywriters do or most business owners who are trying to make an offer uh to be compelling to a marketplace what they do is they just stack as many different great things inside as they possibly can and then say well if that one doesn't work one of them will work so i'm just going to throw them all in he said that's the recipe for he calls toss salad copy
(01:30) which is just you just jumble everything together and you hope you know it's throw everything in the wall and see what sticks but the reality is the most compelling messages and he reviewed the top 100 offers of all times since they worked there 91 of them all centered on a single concept and so if you think about what that means it means that you're looking for the one big idea the one compelling message that has to be easy to understand easy to believe and interesting or unique and so he said those are the three elements of a one big idea and so
(02:05) when you're thinking about the sales messaging and this has been really just i've been i've been putting this at the forefront of my mind is that when you're writing copy for a for an advertisement or you're writing copy for a landing page the sub bullets should only be bullets that reinforce the singular message or the singular argument right they should be stories they should be uh arguments they should be facts that are presented solely to reinforce the singular concept right and so if i said you know hey there's uh
(02:36) six ways six ways to to to you know wake up early or something like that um or six morning strategies if each one of them was kind of different that's like it's it's a tossed salad whereas if i wanted to center it around one big benefit or one core topic now the six topics that i have underneath of it are gonna still be sub points of the major one rather than uh you know 15 crazy headline ideas right and so for me that has been incredibly powerful and if you look at if if you have advertised before and you look at
(03:09) the best converting advertisements that you've ever had you will probably see that similar trend where the ones that do best are the simplest the most direct and the clearest to understand now the issue is when you only have to pick one it forces you to be incredibly uh tactful on your selection because you're only going to pick one and so i think what that ends up doing is it forces us as marketers to really think is this the is this the best idea is this the most centralized focused concept that i can point as the tip of my spear of my
(03:42) communication message right and so uh a lot of these things around like any kind of unique selling proposition that's going to be the rule of one right you don't want to have 19 selling propositions you want to have one core one that everyone can immediately understand is is counterintuitive and uh is believable right and so when you put all three of those things together then you have a message that's compelling and people will take one step towards you and so um i have now like i said i wrote that at the top of my computer as i've
(04:10) been writing copy and keeping this a top of mind because i can guarantee you that even since i started doing this just even reading the book i've gotten the the copy that i've been putting out has been so much better and more targeted and crisper because there's one central idea i'm trying to convince the reader or prospect of and then and then the sales message that follows is actually very transparent and simple to write the hard part is figuring out what that one idea is going to be but if you're going to think about
(04:36) one thing then that would be the one to focus on so anyways i hope that was valuable for you i share this stuff as it comes to me in my in my journey of marketing and sales and so i hope you enjoy this like subscribe all that kind of stuff and i'll see you next video bye [Music] [Music] [Applause] you

How to sell a product - The most PURSUASIVE tactic you can use... - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThSFgC_4NVA

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video i want to talk to you about a time where i bombed completely bombed a stage presentation and one of the most important lessons that i've learned from it that has made me a lot of money since then um and has protected my reputation and gotten me a lot of goodwill so if you've ever like not known what to do or what to offer people or hey should i try and use this as an opportunity to build goodwill or forge a relationship or should i try and you know sell something or get a margin on this i want to tell you a couple different stories
(00:29) that kind of all illustrate the same point that i've learned over the last few years all right and so um one of my favorite uh kind of like bullets on this that you can you can write or downer is uh no half measures right uh either sell or don't sell but don't be in between and so the first time that this kind of happened for me was i was uh asked to speak at this kind of high level uh mastermind which happens relatively frequently um but this one in particular was a it was a fitness related one um and uh for me
(00:59) when i have presentations and stuff i usually spend a long time preparing sometimes i'll make a product actually that was the only time i made a product but i spent a long time on the presentation so it's usually a big deal for me to say yes because it's like i'm gonna have to i'm gonna have to do a lot of work on my side um and so anyways i had this uh this this this presentation in this pitch that i had made for a product that we had made specifically for this audience and when i got there they had given me a three
(01:24) hour time slot all right which is insane and i think part of that was because they just wanted to have me talk as long as possible you know for their audience because they thought it would be valuable and so for whatever reason i agreed um and the thing is is like you can't pitch for three hours or maybe you can but you can't straight pitch for three hours right and so what i decided to do is just provide you know a lot of value you know near the end after two and a half hours i was like i'll just kind of mention what we have going on
(01:48) right and so i get up there first off uh the the audience size is one-third of what was what i was told so i was like okay that's a little bit different and disheartening i go and i you know piece by piece i'm doing q a with the audience all that kind of stuff right and so as we transition um or as we as i transition to the pitch part right i uh i pull up the the slide deck that's normally a you know a 90 minute slide presentation um with a pitch and an offer and everything and i went through it and i was like
(02:18) yeah yeah we talked about this and i'm going through the slides right like like super fast just being like yep and this you guys don't need me to tell you the story right you should understand this boom boom boom and then at the very end i i basically make the pitch right without any kind of pre-frame and i go through it just like really fast and kind of half-assed and um i bombed it was horrendous it was horrible because i had so much speaking time they didn't take me off stage because i still had like time left and so i'm sitting
(02:50) there on stage having made the offer no one's moved and then people were and then all of a sudden ra hand star racing from the audience with with questions and i had never sold anything that was cheap in my life so this was a two thousand dollar thing it was literally the first time in my entire life at first on anything below 16 000 um you know which is which was you know for our into the fitness space right i thought this was like a no-brainer it's too grand either i mean just buy it and then make a ton more money
(03:18) because it's it's stupid right i started having people be like hey can i can i do a payment plan on the two thousand dollars i remember be like if you need a payment plan then uh don't buy it and next question and someone's like i feel like um you know the supplements that you have are against my my goodwill because we i only promote vegan things and i was like cool then don't buy it and this is how the questions start unrolling like this vibe this toad right and you could just watch the plane just going towards the ground
(03:48) on fire burning right i do this for like 30 more minutes all right of q a of me just getting increasingly annoyed because hey there's only like 30 people there which there was supposed to be a lot more than that anyways and so i remember the feeling i had afterwards which was just like anger and embarrassment and just like you know humiliate all of those you know at once and mind you like at the time and this is then right we were doing about four million a month all right and so when i had some people were like well how do we know it's gonna
(04:19) like gonna work for a fitness house like i have 4 000 freaking locations here like that use this licensing model i paired it down just for you guys so that you can use the materials at a at one-eighth the price this is not a discussion right so anyways i remember sitting there and in the pain of the moment and the humiliation i was like what am i going to learn from this which may be in and of itself something that you might be able to take with you but like whenever you have those like super emotional moments right
(04:45) i know from my conversations with dr cashy that when you have extreme emotions you're actually in in hyper learning mode ptsd is where you're basically you turn your brain on and it goes into hyper learning mode because there's trauma that is going around you right and or you know there's it's a traumatic experience which just means super heightened emotions and so what happens is your brain says learn from this right and then it starts ingraining these things so that when you hear loud noises then you get amped and then etc
(05:11) right and so it's the same kind of thing so if you have these emotional moments this is for me this is what i do is i try and think like what am i going to try and ingrain in my brain right now because i have an opportunity to hyper learn something in these moments and so the lesson i learned and i'll tell you another story in a second that really drove this home no half measures either pitch or don't pitch all right so if you go into a business meeting or you go to a conference or you go to a whatever right
(05:36) either ask hard or do not ask at all there is no half-assed asking all right and this is a lesson that i have learned hard i actually had one of my uh one of my exacts he ended up pitching this is you know now that we've moved ourselves out of that business and now we're just on top of it one of the the execs in my gym business he half pitched something to our audience he like half pitches like you guys don't need me to do the scarcity thing right you guys don't need me to do these guarantees right you don't need me to do these actually these
(06:03) bonuses right and i was like what are you doing i remember because the i was like that is how you pitch you're saying that they don't need all the things that persuade them he's like well they know because we teach them how to do this stuff and i was like yeah but like people still need it to make decisions and so he bombed that and he learned the lesson himself so my goal is that you don't have to bomb it uh to learn the lesson right and so let me tell you the upside of this here's the flip side right so i talked about just now how you
(06:27) can how like no half measures either pitch or don't pitch right don't go in the middle i think one of the one of the things that's difficult for entrepreneurs is to know when to make the ask right so it's like okay well if i'm either going all in or all out well then how do i know when to do which right and i would say that most times i have been better served in my life by holding back my ask and what i mean by that and this is like a super life hack so for those of you who are who are who are perseverant and
(06:56) focused on what i'm saying right now then take this in if you get to a point of good will if you keep giving and keep giving and keep giving you don't need to ask ever you will just get so there's there's the commonly you know told like you know uh jab jab jab right hook right give give give ask right but i will i would postulate that there is another one that is even more powerful which is give give give give give give give give get give give give give get give give get right is that people will just start handing
(07:31) things to you because humans are reciprocal in nature they believe that if they are getting something at a certain point they must reciprocate somehow which is why the spammers who copy my name on this channel do so well with my channel because i don't ask for anything from mozy nation so by the way just another disclaimer i will not dm you or put you on whatsapp and ask you for cab fare or ask you to buy something everything that i have is free here so just fyi just as a reminder to everybody and a lot of the best things that i've
(08:00) had happen in my life have come from goodwill and so i think the biggest difference between big business owners and small business owners is that they do not understand and apply the concept of goodwill right and i'll do an entire thing on goodwill next time because it's a deep topic that i love talking about but right now in your business you have the opportunity to provide things for your audience and if you can continue to provide them and have the patience to wait for the ask you can actually make significantly more
(08:27) money all right and so the thing is is if you're going to make the ask which means if you're going to withdraw from your your relational capital right the goodwill that you have in your audience if you're going to make the withdrawal then ask and ask hard and mean it it's not the time to make it a nickel here a nickel there a nickel there right it's so much better to just keep investing keep over delivering and then when you ask make it known that you are asking and that is one of the biggest lessons that i have learned over time in
(08:56) business for me is that it is so much better to give and keep giving and keep giving and oftentimes you will get and if you pitch which you if like the idea is to ideally never even have to because you should be getting so much but if you if you must pitch then pitch like you mean it right and don't have asset so anyways that was a story of my bombing i hope you uh found some humor in that uh for my humiliation um mosey nation love you all uh my name is oxford mosey i have i i own acquisition.com which is portfolio
(09:25) of companies so if you enjoyed this hit the subscribe button and i will see you guys in the next video a lot of people are broke and i don't want you to be one of them which is why i make this channel keeping awesome lots of love bye

Small Businesses CANNOT Afford to Make This Mistake - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) businesses making less than $10 million per year cannot afford to make this mistake and it's a problem that limited me and my ability to sell my company but when I fixed it I was able to sell it for $ 46.2 million and there are four steps to solving this problem to avoid This calamity and lots of blood and death and it all starts with number one keyman risk a single person that is vital to the operations of the business and if they were gone the business would decrease materially in the amount of money that it makes or disappear
(00:32) altogether and so think about it like this you've got these functions that occur in the business on a regular basis and there may be multiple people that can do these functions and so the opposite of keyman risk is redundancy meaning if one of these people disappear we still have a flow for let's say dollars to go across this bridge it can still keep kind of make its way through but all of a sudden if you've got one here and it doesn't matter how many different redundancies you have in the rest of the system if this goes away there's no way else for the dollars or
(01:04) the customers to move across and hopefully into your pocket that's my little pocket for you why this matters is that if you have keyman risk you don't have an asset you have a high-paying job and I don't say that to insult you I say that so that you can be aware of it so that you can actually fix it and to be clear if you are fine just working and not necessarily owning an asset that's great there's nothing wrong with trading time for money big fan and so so I'll give you an example when I had gym launch I was kind of the innovator of the product and the service
(01:36) and so I came up with the solutions for the gyms and so for an acquirer or a private Equity Firm who wants to buy this business or whoever else you might want to sell a business too having one person especially if it's the person who's going to leave when the business is sold is a huge massive red flag for them because they're like wait we're buying this production but it's with this key cog in the machine and you want to have us buy this thing and remove the Cog now in a situation where you raise money for example it's not as much of an issue because those people those pieces those cogs are still in the machine if
(02:11) you wanted to sell a company and you own the company and you leave and all the people who are still keyman remain within the business then what they're going to do is try and incentivize those people to stay but it still makes the company sellable so this just counts double if it's the owner or somebody who's going to leave as a result of a transaction is the keyman risking any of the functions of the business so I was keyman in the delivery and so I did a couple things to solve the problem so number one is that I created a
(02:43) department called the R&D department and so the way it worked was simple I thought about the process that I would go through when I wanted to innovate the product so I'd say okay what can we do for our gym owners that will help them generate more leads make more sales whatever the issue was and so the first thing that I did was that I would say okay I have a way of identifying problems and so I would ask the customers and the nice thing is if you listen to your customers they will shout at you and they will tell you exactly what their problems are and so I'd say Okay number one is that I had these
(03:12) problems now I have to solve those problems and so I'd have them rank the problems they say okay this month lead generation is the biggest issue they want more leads and I'd say all right now the next thing that I would do is I would deploy resources so this would be time and money that ideally my customers couldn't deploy but I could fractionalize that cost between all of my customers to create a much bigger individual investment that any one of them could afford and so let's say they pay $3 or $4,000 a month I would spend
(03:42) $50,000 a month on this test and so I'd say okay go hire a bunch of models go out to a really good gym film some great ads then test Those ads so number three I would test the ads in representative Market markets so I'd have 20 markets or so that would represent different demographics so black white asian Hispanic poor markets Rich markets large markets small markets with good operators with poor operators with mediocre operators that way I had a true sampling rather than just saying I'm just going to send this to my favorite customers because that's not going to
(04:16) work and so we test it and then what I would do is hand off winners and so what that meant was I would say okay these ads of the 30 that we ran and we spent $50,000 on this whole thing these two or three were the ones that generated the highest returns and then I would give all of those to the gyms in our distribution base so that they could run those ads they just wanted the inputs to feed the system and those inputs were required on a regular basis in order for me to hand this off to someone I said
(04:45) this is fundamentally the way I do it I look at the problems that they have in this instance it was lead generation I would dedicate time time and money to solving this problem in a way that they couldn't do it so that I could create a better solution that they could do it on their own I would test to validate that the solution that I had was Superior and then we roll it out and I followed this process for my R&D so that I could replicate the person with a system and so typically keyman risk will occur in
(05:13) three primary areas so number one is that it can occur in marketing so how do we get leads in the door the second big place that it can occur is sales or conversion how do we get prospects to hand US money for our goods and services and then third is the actual goods and services themselves which you can consider product Etc this happens at any level so if you're a service and you're just happen to be the best plumber or the best electrician or you're the best coder or you're the best Advertiser now
(05:43) with marketing for example if you own a marketing agency you probably your key man on marketing for yourself and marketing for your customers right like it can happen in multiple places even if it's one person and in the and the more places one person is keyman the riskier the business is overall now I want to be clear keyman risk is a double-edged sword because the more valuable you become more of a key man you are and so the idea is that as soon as you learn a very valuable skill the most valuable thing that you can do next is learn how
(06:12) to transfer that skill to another person and I think this is a skill that I've spend a tremendous amount of time trying to hone so that I can build companies and I think about it like this assemble companies assemble people and then transfer the skills around whatever area has some sort of bottleneck where there's too few people people who know how to do the thing and this is so important because whether you want to sell a business or not making a business that is sell a bull makes it better for anyone here's the best analogy I have say that you've bought a house now if you've never bought a house before then this may be news but when you buy a
(06:45) house what happens is that after a certain amount of time and the average American like three to five years they they they change where they live all right so you buy a house now over time you got some wear and tear on the house and the house kind of degrades in your mind right like that you get a little crack on the front porch this this door kind of squeaks a little bit and when you go to sell what do you do well you fix the you fix the little path in front of the house you put some oil on the little hinges here you know you're like you know what maybe I'll put a little patio out back I feel like that would
(07:12) increase our home value right and then all of a sudden and this is the crazy thing right when you're about to sell the house and you fixed all the things that are wrong with it you're like you know this house ain't so bad right and so the same exact thing happens with the business if all of a sudden you remove yourself as keyman in marketing and sales and product all of a sudden you're like huh this business almost runs without me this ain't so bad now the last area that you can have keyman risk that can occur and this is kind of like the glue
(07:43) between all of these is operations so if you have a key leader for example who has tremendous influence over the entire team then the operations connects the people to their functions and so think of that as kind of the glue that runs the organization like if ilila were to leave she would leave a huge vacuum at acquisition.
(08:09) comom now she's not specifically over Marketing sales or product she just has all of these leaders that are rolling into her and so if the leadership was gone that in and of itself would also be somebody who's key man and to be clear key man is Key Human so it doesn't have to be a Founder it can be an employee who can be keyman and if you do have someone who's keyman in your business and it's your business and not theirs then it would behoove you if they're truly key man to incentivize them in some material way to stay so if you're thinking to yourself okay this is me I'm
(08:40) definitely keyman or there's somebody in my business who's keyman on Marketing sales operations product then there are two major ways that you can solve this so the first is through process and people just like I walked through earlier where I said okay what are the actual steps that I do in order to solve this marketing problem what are the actual steps that I use use to think through creating new products what are the actual steps that I use to think through creating sales process driving sales results Etc so it's process and the people who will then do those
(09:10) processes within the business the second way and this really only applies if it's not you who is the person who's keyman is incentives and so if it's you you only have option one if it's somebody else other people you have option one and option to to solve the problem and so for example if I said hey I will incentivize you to stay in this business by giving you some vesting of shares over a three or 5e period then that would make it less likely that the person's going to leave and disrupt the business I think through it in both of
(09:47) these now which of these is the most valuable like most valuable to the business to do well the most valuable to do is this one but the higher up the skill set is the more unique the individual like think about Elon Musk he's key man in almost all of his businesses but the reason that it's okay is that he has no desire to sell them and so people bet on Elon and the companies they bet on Jeff basos and the the businesses because they are inseparable entities like they go one together and no one's leaving right they
(10:19) got public and all of their Shares are still theirs and they're still incentivized to continue to grow it now if you're watching this and wondering well okay processing people what does that actually mean so ins inside $100 million leads I break this down so in the employees section which is a chapter in the book in terms of how to help how to get people to get you more customers you have the functions that an employee would do and so there's two aspects one is like how do I get these people and so you can use warm Outreach to ask your network you can do cold Outreach which
(10:47) is basically recruiting you can post content which is basically posting job openings that you have available doing paid ads so promoting job postings on like a Craigslist or an indeed or a monster or a ladder getting employee referrals right so rather than customer referrals you're getting employee referrals Affiliates would be like associations guilds list serves that already have a huge amount of people who want this specific type of roller job agency so think like staffing firms and then obviously employees themselves uh could be could be the solution now how do you get them to actually do this and
(11:17) so the step one is that you document which is basically saying hey here's our checklist of things that must occur in order for this process to be deemed complete or sufficient the second D here is demonstrate which is that you do it in front of them right so you do it on your own and you create the checklist then you do that checklist in front of them and you only stick with that checklist because if you do anything off the checklist then you have to add to it and then finally you they do it in front of you so they duplicate it so you
(11:46) document checklist you demonstrate it in front of them then they demonstrate it in front of you which is basically duplication and so that three-step process is fundamentally how you can teach anyone to do anything and in order to make a process more teachable you simply have to break it down to more and more steps based on the skill of the person you're teaching it to if I wanted to teach an advanced marketer how to do email marketing for example I wouldn't say hey turn on your computer step two pull up Internet Explorer step three sign up for a Gmail account right I wouldn't have to go through all those steps because there's an assumed level
(12:22) of proficiency this is why when you go to college or whatever education system you went through there are prerequisites for moving on to the next level so that they don't have to teach you arithmetic and then teach you calculus later they just assume you know it and so your checklist that you create is going to depend on the level of the person that you're teaching the skill to and the lower the level the more checks you're going to be on the list the more you need to regress it and so let's say you brought on somebody for sales right who's going to be a director of sales this might be a higher level world you
(12:51) would still follow the same thing as hey these are the activities that I spend my time on this is what I actually do then they're going to watch you do it you probably are running teams you're probably doing one-on ones you're probably looking at data to look for key out points so that you can address them and solve them within the team and then they are going to take over those responsibilities do them in front of you and then when they have done them to the satisfactory level you can then delegate
(13:17) it and so the easy litmus test for good delegation is that after you've given the responsibility away and someone else is actually doing the actions then the performance of the department or function either remains neutral or goes up that is when you have successfully delegated it's not that you give something to someone that makes it delegation you can give something to someone and completely abdicate or basically get rid of responsibility but with no feedback loop to determine whether or not you did a good job or that they're doing a good job and so it
(13:48) has to be the performance of the function after you've handed off that determines whether or not you have successfully delegated and sometimes you have to repeat the cycle multiple times with the same person and that's okay because you need to learn to on how to teach better and quick Pro tip if you're a smaller business and let's say that you do some sort of service and it's just you or just you and a couple people there are three options that you can do when you have too much demand and very fixed amount of Supply like you can't you can't you're you're completely maxed out you can't take on any more customers you barely can't so option one is that
(14:20) you can simply raise your prices and if you do that you'll absolutely make more money so you'll get paid more for the same thing which is my favorite way of getting paid now the second thing that you can do is you can increase the service ratio and so that means instead of doing oneon-one for example I would do one on five or one on 10 now alternatively you can think of it with a team the same way which is let's say I have four people who work in my agency and they do different functions to serve one type of customer then if I can change it from those four people
(14:50) together can handle 20 clients I could have those four people together handling 40 clients and so the ratio still shifts towards us so you get more efficient which is either process or some sort of technology or training that allows you to get more from your existing Talent the third and this is the most valuable one is that you do this processing people is that you actually get somebody else to do the work for you which typically means you have to organize the stuff make sure they they did it successfully and you can hand it off now these two things
(15:20) both make you more money this one helps you eliminate the actual problem of keyman risk and if I had to do this in sequence meaning in what order would I do this first is I would raise prices because that requires the least amount of work and can immediately make me money if I'm Supply constrained second I would say okay well people are saying yes to these higher prices well I don't want to raise prices again which you obviously still can I can shift my service ratio at this current price to fundamentally Dude down the service that I have because it's so good and as long
(15:51) as my value still exceeds my price without raising the price with this second implementation I would still have people who want to give me money now if I've done as much of these two things as I can I can then say you know what I want to not have to do any of these things at all I want someone else to do them and then that transforms this particular job that you have because as an entrepreneur you'll have more than one job it takes this job takes the hat off your head and puts it on someone else's and then that shifts you towards
(16:17) owning an asset rather than owning a job and to be clear I'm all for maximizing the amount of money that you're making and some businesses lend themselves more to kind of the people and process stuff than others do Taylor Swift for example is going to have a hard time being like hey this is my blonde double and she's going to sing for you guys today because look I've I've delegated the responsibility now it's very unlikely that that would happen and so there are situations where you just have unicorns in a business and so that's where you just have to align incentives like crazy
(16:49) and try and take it all the way which is either you're just getting a paid a ton of money which you know Taylor Swift does or you create liquidity meaning you you get paid for the equity shares that you have via a different vehicle than selling so when you go public you don't you sell a little bit of the company but the vast majority of the wealth that most of those Founders have is that they have shares that they can take loans against the bigger a business gets if you don't have any desire to sell you can take debt or other instruments where people will lend you and you can collateralize or back it up with the
(17:20) stock that you have in the business and so if you don't pay them back they get to own shares in the company if you are keyman in your business or someone else in your business is keyman help me spread the word with this because these mes cost me so dearly that I hope that it prevents everyone else from making them that way we can all ride into the sunset into our amazing businesses that are risk-free and making all the money in the entire world so if you could hit the share button and send it to friends and family and even enemies for you know
(17:43) I mean like hey they need help too or friend ofies maybe a little bit safer than it would me in the world otherwise enjoy the rest of it so now that we covered keyman risk the next mistake that business owners under 10 million doll make is single Channel risk now that's just a fancy word so let me tell you what it means if more than half of your customers or leads come from one place you have single Channel risk and the concept behind this is that if that were to stop it would materially affect your business on a long time Horizon so quick illustration one of our portfolio companies which is the teeth whing chain
(18:14) got a lot of business from outbound almost all customers were coming from that specific Source all of a sudden the rules on that platform changed based on the way that we could message almost overnight we had 50 to 70% few sales coming in from that primary channel that is single Channel risk can you imagine as a business owner over overnight you're like oh my God this real change if you're ads dependent let's say the way that you get customers is on meta ads and then you you lose your account boom all of a sudden your business almost goes to zero or if you have an organic content following and you're
(18:47) only on one platform for example and that platform bans you or restricts you or Shadow bands whatever and then boom all of your lead flow disappears or you have let's say a domain or a server that you send your emails from when you do outbound and all of a sudden that gets whacked with some sort of you go into the promotions tab on email all of a sudden all your response rates from your domain go to almost nothing in each of those scenarios you have single Channel risk now thankfully for this particular business I had spent the last 6 months or more building out a recurring Revenue
(19:20) stream and I I detailed that in a different video where we went from like 5% of Revenue being uh recurring Revenue to over 60% of Revenue being recurring Revenue even though we decreased the amount of new sales coming in by over half it didn't actually change our overall Revenue because we had so much compounding that had started to become unlocked which is why there are multiple ways to stabilize a business but for the purpose of this video if you have only one way to get customers then you have one way to lose them so if you have Facebook ads that are running in this
(19:52) boat and this is how you get your little fishies there's our little fishy from Facebook and then this thing breaks all of a sudden you've got no fish and then you would be very sad and then you would jump overboard and die very sad for you and your family and you know peace and blessings be upon you now let's say that you're this other guy and you said you know what I have seen this happen before because I've had account shut down from organic from paid or domains that that don't work out anymore for for cold outbound but you know what I've made YouTube organic I've got ads I've got
(20:26) email outbound let's say we also have Instagram content or organic okay so let's say that our our same our same issue happens with Facebook boom this guy loses the fish here now this fish is very happy because he's not going to die and get eaten all right but but we still have all these other fish that are coming in from the other channels and so this guy is still like you know what I still do have a little bit of a tummy here from all the fish that I've been eating maybe it's good for me to tighten
(20:54) tighten the belts a little bit and then I can go home and feed my family and they've been a little chunky as well well lately and so you know what and farm fishing is bad and let's talk about all sorts of political things anyways back to it you can see the problem here clear as day if you have one source of getting customers you've also only got one that needs to break in order to fail and to show how these lessons stack together if we only had one keyman and then this guy dies very sad right he's little double X's here all right Dead all right because he had no fish if we
(21:24) had a second fisherman who was on the deck he might say you know what I'm going to throw another line out and maybe I'm going to catch some of these YouTube fishies over here and at least you'd have a shot but if you have single Channel risk and keyman risk you're double if you wanted to buy this fisherman business would you well it's like well shoot there's so many ways for this thing to fail versus this one this guy's got a crew of people that are all Manning each of the the polls and so even if they that looks bad but if any of these
(21:57) guys went down so this guy jumps overboard right then these guys are still like Yay I'm going to get a pay raise hey can we get his payroll those greedy bastards but this is fundamentally a fishing boat that I would have a much larger likelihood of buying because it has a larger likelihood of producing fish consistently so first off who needs to worry about this well it's more important the bigger your business gets the more important this is and let me explain tactically how this works because let's say even volatility from a single channel is something that could
(22:28) Rock the the boat figuratively if you have a small business and let's say the channel goes down by 20% then let's say you've got one sales guy and his calendar goes from 100% filled to 80% filled not a huge deal if you have a 100 sales guys and their calendars go from 100% right to all of a sudden 20 of the guys have completely empty calendars that level of volatility that can occur when you only have one channel makes it much more difficult to do business on a regular basis there's a variety of solutions that I will walk you through
(23:00) so number one is that if you're a tiny business you don't need to worry about this yet but my biggest advocate for being a small business is that you're going to have one primary method for getting cold people which is usually going to be outbound number one which is you're reaching out to prospects who don't know who you are two is going to be Affiliates so again you've got third parties that are sending you traffic three you've got ads that are ways that people are coming into the business business and you've got organic so this
(23:30) is going to be likely how you're going to be getting customers now I would recommend that you do one of these three and then plus this now this may seem like a little bit of a departure from some of the things I've talked before where one channel one Avatar one product up to a million dollar a year and that's true it's just that I've seen like so many people be able to manage this it's such high return for such low effort that the organic that you put here is not really to acquire customers it actually functions more to amplify what you're doing with these other channels
(24:03) and so if you are doing outbound and then people Google you and then they can find a little bit of content then it's like oh this is guy this guy has a poll so this is a real business someone is an affiliate or Affiliates are sending you customers or you're trying to sell Affiliates then just knowing that you have some sort of presence increases the likely they do business with you and same thing with ads and so if you're a small business this is going to be one of the big ones that you're probably going to use but the organic is just
(24:24) something that you can do even one post a week it doesn't have to be a ton just to look like you have a pulse now if you're a bigger business then this becomes a much bigger deal for you the way that we solve this is uh a standardized process that I've now had to jump through with a lot of companies so the first thing we do is we Shore up long-term nurture so long-term nurture means a combination of making more content and email specifically followup because a lot of people a lot of businesses don't do a good job following up with leads and so they have this list
(24:57) of 10,000 or 20,000 1,000 people that have done business with them over a long period of time or at least given them their information if we create a Cadence or some sort of schedule around reaching out to those people providing value and then occasionally presenting offers we're going to have another stream of customers that's coming in so think of this as in a way another customer stream but it's an incredibly lowrisk customer stream that is the most profitable of all streams and so email marketing for example has depending on the source a
(25:26) 42:1 to 36:1 return on dollars it's like oh my God like why would we not do that so we do this to decrease our risk increase our cash flow in the short term to get that engine going the next engine that I like to make sure is very strong is my referral engine and so if I haven't put a strong referral system in place to get customers to send me more customers and made sure that I'm asking multiple times in different and creative ways throughout the customer Journey then I Implement that next again we're getting more for what we put in and if we get more that's going to increase our
(25:57) cash flow without adding cost basis to the business so it's basically think about it it's like decreasing risk and increasing our ability to make bets after we've got the long-term nurture firing and we've got the referral system going this should give us a little bit of padding to then invest in the second Channel now when I say invest the way that it typically works is that you will see no outcome for an extended period and then all of a sudden it will start working and you may get frustrated in the short term that you're not seeing immediate results but welcome to business you have to think long term about the value of what a second
(26:29) acquisition Channel or third acquisition Channel means to you so number one is that when you do the second acquisition Channel you can immediately double sales or more and if you double Revenue you typically far more than double profit so that's number one number two is that the business itself becomes less risky so not only are we adding revenue and profit to the business the revenue and profits itself is more likely to continue and so the business itself becomes more valuable and you can sleep much better at night knowing that if one of these things goes down my team is still fed and so when we make this
(27:01) investment here's one of the big no no is you don't do two news so what does that mean well if you're going to start a new channel that's one new what you don't want to do is put a new person on a new channel because then you don't know which new is the problem because even if you take you and maybe you're really good or your best person and you put them on the new channel well there's already the newness of the new channel and you won't know but if it's somebody you know who's really good then at least we're working through the channel itself otherwise you could be stuck paying lots
(27:29) of money for a long period of time not knowing if you're solving the right problem which is why I'm such an advocate for Founders to have deep understanding of the core processes of the business which for me are understand how you get customers which to me marketing and sales and understand how you deliver value now if you wanted to Outsource it if you wanted to Outsource accounting if you wanted to Outsource you know HR or payroll processing those are things that I don't see as core to the business you can of course bring them in house when it cost makes sense
(27:53) but in terms of the core economic engine of the business those are the things that you the founder the entrepreneur want to understand intimately if I am going to start a new channel I do these two things first in order to give myself some breathing room I get a little more cash flow I get a little bit more from what I'm already doing and then I have one new which is the new channel and then old person now it doesn't actually have to be old but it's somebody that I know all right and so this can be tough because you're like wait wait I don't
(28:21) want my original channel to go down which is the most common thing that happens in the situation and so my recommendation is transfer the skill on the first Channel first to someone else make sure that they can handle that without decreasing performance ideally it goes up then and only then you can then make the investment into the second Channel where you're the old guy and the channel is the new thing now if you want to bring somebody in to help you with this I think that's a great idea like if you're a larger business and you're like
(28:52) I can't actually just like figure out cold outbound that's fine but you basically have a thought partner and you guys are working through it together because you'll have more context on the business overall and maybe they have more context on the methodology that you're going to use for the second Channel but that merger those things coming together where you learn a lot about the method they learn a lot about the context of the business both people get better this is how I've been able to successfully use all of these different methods of getting customers in
(29:16) different companies now that we've covered single Channel risk the next mistake that business owners make under 10 million is key customer risk and we're almost there I mean you can see this tiny little Gap here I guess we could fall down here to our deaths but we're going to assume that we've got some pretty good UPS here and we can we can make this little jump so here's a visual to kind of make this make sense for you if any customer or Associated customers left tomorrow would your Revenue drop by 20% or more now the reason 20% is kind of the number I choose is that most businesses run at 10
(29:46) 20 30 40% margins and so if you had even a 40% margin which would be a great margin you lose half your profit this would be material to the business itself and its value so I'll give you a real business story so I had a business owner come out to acquisition.
(30:05) comom who was an agency owner and he had 10 customers and nine of his customers were small like Tech SEO like agency customers and then one customer was Google itself and he was a massive percentage of his Revenue so for him for this example this was actually 70% of his Revenue so if you actually look at the meat of this fish and you added all these little pieces of meat in between together this is definitely the fish that has all the money if I'm this owner I'm like oh my God if I if I lose this whale it's going to kill my business I'm going to I I won't be able to I have to let go of
(30:36) half my staff certainly lose all my profit and so this is a huge risk to the business so there are four proven ways to solve this problem so when this business owner came out I said we're going to go through all four and you're going to pick the one that you think you have the highest likelihood of achieving and so if this is you this is how you solve it so the first way you can do it is that you simply go get more I got to draw these fish cuz I have no idea I have to think about how to draw these uh
(31:01) these little fishies here all of a sudden you get a bunch more minnows and then all of a sudden by percentage man these are ugly fish by percentage you know what this will isn't 70% of my business anymore so you just keep adding minnows to your boat and then all of a sudden you're like you know what my minnows way outweigh my whale and so I don't have key customer risk anymore the second way is that you lock this whale in to a long-term contract so just think about this whale as signing his life away but you get Google or whatever this customer is to sign a threeyear a 5year
(31:32) a seven-year commitment and you can add some bonuses in in there and say you're going to have some dedicated reps or you're going to have some sort of discount that might be associated with that kind of commitment but when they do that then it makes it more stable because it's unlikely that they're going to leave and if you want to be smart about this just a little Pro tip add a little breakup Fe because some people are still going to back out on their agreement and you don't want to get into a legal battle so you want to just give
(31:55) them some way in the future but just knowing that there's this nut that they're going to have to pay will prolong how long they'll stay with you and so I would probably charge somewhere in the neighborhood of 10 to 20% of the contract now all the stuff's negotiable as a breakup fee so if someone has a 5-year deal then I might say you got to pay a year uh if you're going to break up beforehand another way of thinking about it is saying whatever discount I give you you're going to have to pay to make up that discount for the entirety
(32:23) of the contract in order to leave the contract another one is that they have to give you six or 12 months of heads up so there's a lot of ways that you can write terms around this with a whale to decrease the likelihood that they leave and disrupt the business now that's path number two the third path is and this is my preferred path is you just get more damn whales and then all of a sudden you realize you know what dude I'm in the whale business right why was I hunting minnows look at the meat on these guys right and so all of a sudden you don't
(32:54) try to outnumber with minnows you make all of a sudden you just go get five six more whales and this isn't 10% or 20% of your business so path four is a nasty one and for many of you if this is your situation it may actually be the right path and I'll tell you a story to illustrate it so there was a recruiting firm that I was talking to and they had grown a decent amount and they had this Mondo contract that was on the horizon and so they staffed for very specific types of engineering roles that were
(33:21) difficult to find so they definitely had a niche that they had found and they had some big whale come to them and say hey we want you to staff US with 20 new employees a month which was a big contract for this firm so this firm was probably doing $6 $700,000 a month and so this would be like an additional $200,000 a month that they were going to be able to contract through this new whale when they were asking how should we negotiate this deal what pricing should we put in there I thought about it for a long time and I was like you know what guys I think the actual best move is to not do this deal because they
(33:52) were going to have to basically change the fundamentals of their business their pricing their delivery the whale demanded so many so many custom things that were only going to be a use case for them and were not going to service the rest of their customers and they had no way of reliably acquiring the whale so I'll explain the difference so if the whale comes in through a tried andr Channel then this might make a ton of sense but if you just get a random referral or you just meet somebody you work from your network building your entire business around an unsustainable
(34:22) or unpredictable way of getting this type of customer is probably not smart now if that recruiting firm had said hey we just got our first whale but we have a new way of getting whales then I say oh this is the first whale of many this makes sense but if this is just a random lottery ticket that falls into your lap you have to make the decision of what business do I really want to be in and what customer do I really want to serve I think that this entrepreneur just saw dollar signs in his eyes but didn't calculate the cost of what it would mean to his business and the disruption of
(34:53) the main economic engine that he had spent years putting together and so path 4 is you just realized that this whale might be someone else's customer and you let it swim on by and the fourth one and this one is a crazy one that I've got a story for you is single vendor risk so this is where one vendor so think about any person that's a business that you pay to help you do business is responsible for a key function of the business and so there's a ton of examples of this if you have all of your customers from SEO for example and you have an SEO who does it for you if you have all your you know leads from PPC or
(35:32) meta ads and somebody else has all of that taken care of but they're an outside company that is key vendor risk unfortunately I've had this happen a lot all right so with Prestige Labs I had one manufacturer who made our products we found out that he ended up stealing about $400,000 in cash that I had sent so and he kept asking for early and earlier payment on stuff um to lock in Greater discounts and in general if I have cash and I can guarant a 10 or 20% return on that money then it's almost like I could put it in the stock market but I know for sure I'm going to get 20%
(36:05) discount for sure then it's like getting a 20% return on the money guaranteed so I'll take those deals when they come but kept asking for it earlier and earlier and earlier and when we just said hey you know what it had been enough times we're like why don't you just send us what you owe us in terms of product all of a sudden he couldn't because what he had used is he was using our cash to run his business rather than use it as an account for the products and raw materials that he needed to purchase for our account obviously that was a big no no and we were able to thankfully like
(36:36) bridge to another provider and not really Create A disruption but for probably a period of 6 months we were running out of product on a regular basis and had like 3 Monon lead times where we had to basically make this transition and we lost a serious amount of Revenue and that was a big hit both to the revenue but also just reputation because Prestige lab sold through Affiliates it still does sell through affili and during that period Affiliates were like dude we can't sell half the products we normally do cuz you don't have them in stock and so that was very tough and I learned that lesson Prestige Labs which was a sub company that I
(37:06) owned at about 20 million bucks a year and I ended up selling that in that 42 million $46 million sale uh to American Pacific group in 2021 Allen uh was a third company that I started and sold in 2021 which was a company that helped brick-and mortar businesses work their leads through automated messaging and I didn't understand how software worked at the time and and so I just said cool I know this problem I'm going to go hire an Outsource Dev team to go build me this software stack and they did and lo
(37:36) and behold here's the crazy thing no one on my team was any bit technological or a developer and so 100% of the development was happening in this outside shop what do you think the outside shop owner did when all of a sudden this thing that he builts doing 500,000 800,000 a million 1.2 1.5 $ 1.7 million in sales all of a sudden magically what was once $100,000 a month in development became 200 300 $500,000 a month of development because he could see how much money we were making which is why I'm such an advocate if if you are going to start a software company you want that person to be inh house at
(38:13) least it be key man man risk that you can control right but instead I had a key vendor who literally designed and built the entire product that I was selling and so this guy had me buy the balls there was nothing I could do and so I had to start building an in-house team in parallel without trying to like let let him know that I'm doing this cuz obviously he could see the writing on the wall and then he was difficult to work with and transferring the knowledge over and it was a nightmare that was my
(38:39) second big experience with this the third you're like you should learn this lesson you know what sometimes it takes me a while uh another one was and I've had multiple with this but payment processor so in my first book $100 million offers I talk about how I lost my payment processor and it was this terrible experience for me because it was the only problem I'd ever encountered in my life that I couldn't save with sales because no one would process the money tldr I was running a national business out of a brick and mortar store that I had in Southern California so I'm processing payments
(39:11) out of Canada I'm processing payments out of Mexico I'm processing payments out of the United States all over the country and they're like wait how is this happening out of a little brick-and mortar store in California I didn't know how this worked I was 25 years old and so I broke the rules and was unaware of it and so they they held my processing after that happened and you only need it to happen once for every single business that I've had afterwards I always have redundancies in processing meaning I
(39:35) have multiple processors that are approved spun up and can handle the entirety of my monthly volume at a moment's notice this is also important from a negotiating perspective because I only had one payment processor I had no ability to negotiate anything in terms of my fees as well and so having multiple there that are approved gave me leverage with the relationship I got better service and if for whatever reason some something goes down I can switch it over in a heartbeat and not even miss miss miss anything now I had a second occurrence with this later on in
(40:06) my career where we did have redundancies and the here was the issue I had a recurring Revenue business and the payment processor acted a little bit Shady which is why I decided to shift away from that specific processor and they said oh if you want to transfer away from us that's going to cost $150,000 and I was like what and they're like yeah it's just a lot of work to transfer all those things over I was like I'm pretty sure it's a button that you click export the thing is is what was I going to do I had multiple Millions a month in recurring Revenue across thousands of customers there was
(40:37) nothing I could do it was basically extortion I paid the bill and then I got my I got all my customer information and I transferred it to a more ethical provider and so I bring these stories up because I hope that you don't have to live through each of these let's get to the tactics for how to actually solve against key vendor risk and I think this one can be so nasty because it's one of the only times where like the person on the other side of the table has leverage and if you don't have a good person on the other side like they may use it and they may try to put you out of business
(41:07) or put you just as close to getting out of business as they I mean they basically can just blackmail you for your own business and the amount they can black you blackmail you for is proportional to how much money you got or at least how much money they think you got so number one rule always have backups for just about everything that's important so you want to think about this in terms of acquisition conversion product and then the layer on top of this obviously is processing banking anything that you do that facilitates
(41:33) transactions with customers and so the big solution and we're going to put this in big green letters so solution number one is redundancy right now I want to be clear about redundancy sometimes redundancy looks like waste but is actually Insurance the day you need it think about it this way if I pay for fire insurance and my house never catches on fire if I knew for a fact that my house would never catch on fire then 100% of that money is completely wasted I literally just flushed the money down the toilet cuz I didn't get anything for it if my house does catch
(42:05) on fire the day it catches on fire every one of those payments will 100% worth it I see redundancy the same way which is that it is insurance against existential threats to the business and these are the things that I'm telling you when I now that I have these things in place it's like one I have leverage in negotiations which is probably the more reasonable thing that you get in terms of short term benefits of having redundancy the second is that you sleep great at night knowing that your business can't get taken down at least from the things that you know about like listen you can't control the unknown
(42:36) unknowns but at least control the knowns if the chickens do come home to roost and you do have that bad day and the bill is due then you will be grateful that you had this redundancy in place the second way of doing this is having mutually ensured destruction so what does that even mean it basically means that if the bigger you get the bigger you are as a percentage of their business the more they need to keep your business and not let you go because basically you shift from them being uh key vendor risk to you becoming key customer risk for them and so it's the
(43:09) shift in power basically the bigger you get the more important you are to them and so there's this saying in the finance world where it's like if you owe a bank a million dollars they own you if you owe a bank a billion dollars you own them right now obviously depends on the size of the bank and things like that but the saying kind of kind of carries right and so you want to understand understand what percentage of the business their business you are and that way if they you they get too so this is where the size of the person that you're working with can be kind of a double-edged sword the small guys are
(43:39) probably the guys that are most likely to do the Shady stuff on the other hand if you become a huge percentage of their business you have some leverage back towards them and so redundancy number one mutually insured destruction number two and here's a big one Covenant and terms all right so I'll just say which are just fancy ways of saying what do we agree to kind of like key customers because key customer and key vendor are kind of opposite sides of the same coin all the terms that we asked from our customers before in the last
(44:04) section for mistakes we also can ask now as the customer of the vendor so we say hey if you want to stop doing business with us you have to give us a 6 or 12 month lead time to letting us know that that's going to occur so that we can find another vendor so this number one is lead time number two is you can have a breakup fee Associated now you can imagine on the other side as a vendor you're like this guy wants to put a breakup fee on me my God this guy's going to be sticky but at this point when you have key components of the
(44:29) business that are outsourced which I I fundamentally don't do this anymore because I have been screwed so many times which is why I think that Marketing sales delivery should be inhouse to a business because it's just too important but like Payment Processing it's unlikely you're going to start a payment processing but just to be able to process your own payments right there are some things that are going to be outsourced you have to have trust one is give the heads up two is the breakup fee third is that you have fees or fines associated with service level agreements meaning you're going to
(44:58) respond to us on this timeline you're going to ship to us products or raw materials on this schedule you're going to get us Le or run this amount of ads on this Cadence and when we think about it that way that allows to say if you don't do those things then you hedge the amount of money that you would have lost as a result of them not doing the work with the fine associat it's basically a hedge now if you have a vendor they're going to try and decrease what that amount of money is but them also having transparency into understanding how important their role is is again a
(45:28) double-edged sword one is they'll understand leverage on the other hand if you get the term inside the deal in terms of the cash required from them to make sure that they're doing their job you cover your downside finally and this is a bit of like a advanced move if you become significantly bigger than they are or you're a huge percentage of their business and they're still important to you that's where things like Aqua hires and Acquisitions can be very strategic so you say hey under what circumstances would you like to do what you do inside of our company is there a way that we
(45:58) could work together more permanently and then you permanently align the incentives if they're doing a good job now if they're doing a terrible job then you obviously want to do that but this is how I think through we're reducing risk with key vendors who are core to how we make money and if they were to disappear so too would our business and so once this happens you get your Superman cape and then all of a sudden this becomes a fist a Fist of Fury if you will and then you can this this is a dotted line because you can fly and you realize that you didn't even need the
(46:31) bridge to begin with because you're such a good business owner and then you go take the money and save the world or do whatever Superman would do with $ 46.2 million which would probably be you know try to double down and make a lot more so that he could actually make a difference in the world rather than just his own life I've talked to over a thousand business owners in person this year I compiled the six most common mistakes that prevent small businesses from becoming big businesses and I made a whole video about it so if you're stuck this is for you

(00:00) mozi nation what it do the number one question that i continue to get on instagram and on this channel is what are the habits that created some of the success we have and so in this video i want to walk you through the four highest roi habits uh that have viewed outsized returns if you don't know who i am or have him into this channel my name's alex ramose i own acquisition.
(00:18) com we do about 85 million a year it's a portfolio company reason i make this channel is because a lot of people are broke and i don't want you to be one of them and of the videos that i've made this one is actually from the past i had a private community that i um used to just put videos in for fun over the last five years uh over 300 of them and this video was one of the top one person videos and so i wanted to share it with you guys publicly enjoy good morning everyone hope you guys are having a fantastic amazing tremendous
(00:43) thursday i wanted to make a quick uh video for you i actually woke up with this on my mind and i thought i would share it and so i'm calling this my four highest roi habits and i know i probably should say three because three is probably a better number but four was what i was really thinking about these are the things that were learned behaviors that i think if i look back on behaviors that have been able that have propelled us forward faster these are the four things that have done that the first one is waking up at
(01:12) 4 00 a.m um and it kind of goes hand in hand with the second habits i'll kind of put these together which is consistent bedtimes and that includes weekends so basically consistent time going to bed and consistent time waking up and i know that sounds minor but a lot of times and for a long period of my life i would wake up early five days a week and then on weekends i would sleep in and i'd go to bed late because i was like i'm living on the weekends and during the week i'm working and i did that for a long period of time the thing is is like
(01:38) your body doesn't work that way i think there's the consistency in the most basic way is literally going to bed at the same time weekend and weekday and waking up at the same time week and and weekday i know this sounds really minor but like especially that 4 a.m up time like us as entrepreneurs like we're i think we're a little bit more reactive than most people are from an emotional standpoint uh like i think we're also a little bit more scattered by nature i don't like to speak that over myself but i think that that's like our intrinsic
(02:05) programming and then we can work away from that that's why control i talk so much about controlling your space controlling your attention is that like we're so much more prone to reactivity um which is also why we want to solve problems faster because we're more uncomfortable than any of everyone else's which is why we naturally move towards problem solving right and so waking up at 4am allows me to get all of my self-work done in the morning and still have two three four five sometimes dedicated hours to moving the
(02:34) big dominoes forward the big projects that are going to make massive impact in the business and are working on the business not in it basically once i hit you know 9 a.m 9 30 a.m i would love to tell you that like oh i have i have four hours of ceo time in the middle of the day that everyone knows that i can't be reached the problem is that like you know if you have a lawyer call come in because we have some you know thing or whatever like i'm gonna take the call if we have a personnel issue where someone's like going nuts you know what
(03:05) i mean like i'm gonna take the call and so like it's it sure would sound nice to say like yeah i mean we're so disciplined at jim lunch that alex never gets you know brought in anything and to be fair the team is awesome and like i really don't get brought into a lot of stuff but the thing is it's like my attention still gets pulled during the day um once everyone else is kind of up but from like four o'clock to nine o'clock is like my time and that's where i really move like all of these big projects forward and that's why like
(03:33) we're like how you get so much done so fast it's like i just think most people don't get very much done during their days at all um because they're working in their business not on it and so we just move we just are able to do a lot of things on the business which then accelerates the entire growth of the business because these are like like the the bricks that you lay on the business are the ones that accelerate growth the things you do in the business is kind of like one is investment one is uh one is spending cash you know what i
(03:57) mean like an expense of time is how you're running your business an investment of time is what's going to move the entire business forward and so it's like are you are you putting investment time in and so for me four am to like nine is like that time period the two first success like i'm gonna say success habits because that sounds lame but like basically the habits that have gotten me that have made me the most funny waking up at 4 00 a.
(04:17) m and that is enabled by uh going to bed consistently at the same time on weekdays and weekends it's just like you can't wake up at nine two days a week and then wake up five hours earlier and expect to be like a productive individual it's just not going to happen so like i would implore you to just like i mean and we were like what about like concerts and like things that are like it's going out with people like there's a reason entrepreneurs live the way they do like really high-level entrepreneurs live a certain way and it is a sacrifice
(04:51) i mean if you see it that way it is a choice and so like i choose that life and that's the life that i choose you don't have to choose that just understand like you're going to like that's your trade-off like and for me going out to dinner at 7 30 on friday is not important to me um i'd rather go like all of my friends who are here in austin know that like if they're gonna go out with alex and layla we're going to dinner at 5 45 so that we like get there receded we get certain like we're eating by 6 15 and we can leave by seven drive
(05:24) home by 7 30 and then we can wind down right like they know that going into it it's just like if you don't want to play that then like that's cool and it means that like our relationship isn't valuable enough for you to eat dinner earlier and that's fine you know what i mean most people are game to do that and they're like you know it's so nice being able to get back at eight and like not ruin your routine i'm like yeah it's awesome like that's why we do it so uh first two waking up early and then consistent bedtimes uh on the weekends
(05:48) especially the next one is this is a little bit different this is something that layla has told me has been like one of the things that she observed early on in our relationship before she like knew me as her husband but like just the guy that she thought was doing things and this man it sounds kind of weird saying it but like this was her observation that she thought i should bring up in this was that like genuinely trying to give to other people in your network without expectation i've always been voted like into like
(06:17) president and leadership positions and like every organized like when i was in high school i was president newspaper and president of the um literary magazine uh when i went to college i was president of you know vp of the powerlifting team and president of the uh of the fraternity i was in like it's like you know i mean it continues on and the thing is like most people think about leadership is that like i have to be the big boss man it doesn't work that way for those who've ever studied it it's like the people who get voted into
(06:41) power the people that that uh like it's funny people always think like the president of the fraternity is the one that's like the biggest rager but the person that they want to vote into president is the one who's going to take the punch ball away to make sure that like when the party's getting going to make sure that like we don't get arrested and like you know things happen the way they're supposed to and it's and it comes from a place of servant like certain it's literally just giving without expectation um and that comes to
(07:06) clients and a lot of times like i would say some of the highest roi um givings that i've done have been to people in my network where they're like hey man do you know anything about this and then i will go the extra mile to um connect them with not one person but like four people do some initial screening myself and say hey man like this is what i saw this is what it looks like here's two people that i think might be able to help you and then this is my experience with it and they're like holy [ __ ] like thank you that's
(07:36) like awesome and then what happens is like you actually form a much better relationship because they're like wow this person like really cared right and then also in the future if i say like hey man do you know anything about this then they return the favor right and so um layla jokes about she's like you have so many favors that you like have uncalled upon like so many ious just like i feel like whenever we need something like you like you have three people you can call who immediately jump to help you and the only reason that
(08:05) happens is because i jump to help them with nothing like ex like expecting nothing back but just because i know that like long term they may have something or know someone who and it's not because of that it's just like and that's why it's like sort of a nature nurturing you know whatever but i can tell you like if you can help people you will get more back and your reputation will also follow from that so those are probably the three biggest uh roi habits uh the fourth one is what leila said that i should i should
(08:35) mention uh well she's like you should say something about sales i joked back with was like i think that's more of a skill set and not not not a habit not a behavior if there were to be a habit that would be associated with that it's jumping into a skill that you are not good at with the expectation that my first 20 hours i expect zero return on and so like if you can look at new skills that you are not good at or do not like we always have this discomfort with acquiring new skills uh like let's say i don't know how to run facebook ads
(09:04) i don't know how to make a landing page i don't know how to manage a team whatever it is right like you're going to suck for a while i think if you can remove the emotional blockage that stops you from taking action because most of us don't like start that new thing because we're afraid of sucking like just being real like we're emotionally afraid of sucking at it and so if you think to yourself i'm gonna get zero roi for my first 20 hours ironically the first 20 hours is where you get like 70 of your gains um in any
(09:34) new skill and then like everything after like hour number 20 is like massive diminishing returns that happens after that right and so like if you just jump into it with zero expectations for the first 20 hours you'd be amazed at like like how many people here if they actually tried like those of you who are on here we're like man i really need to learn how to market if you google how to run a facebook ad and you spend 20 hours watching videos on how to do it you will be better than 99 of people who try and market
(10:03) because no one does anything like seriously like no one does anything and like most people suck at most things including the things they think they're good at right and those ones they ultimately usually aren't that good at either it's because they're pride because they associate the fact that they're good at it uh and then they stop learning because they think they are good because of their ego and so um that's actually what the fourth one was gonna be i was like i know she said sales so i think that the fourth the fourth habit is
(10:31) absolute um responsibility for all situations it's absolute ownership of your life um if anything happens at any time in my relationship with layla with my relationship with an employee with my relationship with the marketplace whatever it is you have to school yourself and literally beat the victim out of yourself like you have to like you have to drag it and beat the crap out of it until it has no strength in your life saying like i'm going to blame my circumstances i'm going to blame my past i'm going to blame my upbringing
(11:01) i'm going to blame my spouse i'm going to blame my employees whatever it is it does not move you forward if you point the finger anywhere but yourself because then it literally gives the power away to the to where you're pointing your finger you're saying i want the power to be away from me like i want the power to be away from me and then i'm talking to my clients too like if you ever blame jim lunch and like i will take complete and extreme ownership over all of your situations because that is my job but if you want
(11:27) to grow as an entrepreneur you should take extreme ownership and and put nothing on our business and i'm talking to you like person to person right like i will always try and over deliver always but the point is is like if we're talking about like my four highest roi habits first one is waking up super early so that i can have time to dedicate to big dominoes the second one is so that i can have consistency in my life and weekdays and weekends are the same to me so waking up and going to bed at the same time so that i have
(11:50) consistency in the most basic way the third i totally forgot what it was but it was i think it was good and then the fourth is uh absolute oh yeah uh giving first without any any uh feelings of reciprocity and then the fourth is absolute ownership and i think that of all the habits that i've had to learn in my life because each one of those was learned like i was not an early riser um i did for a very long time like having different weekend schedules than weekday schedules from like a sleeping standpoint etc to be
(12:23) fair of all of these i think the one that i that that came most nationally to me was the third one which is giving first um and i think that come honestly from a place of insecurity it's like i wanted everyone to like me and so like if i get into a new group a new networking group like i spend a lot of time typically asking people what they're struggling with and like what skills i have that match up with their deficits and then doing everything i can to over deliver to them and like like treat them as though they
(12:49) paid me um to help them and then they're like dude this guy's amazing um and and then i feel like my anxiety goes down inside of a hammer group so that might just be a me thing but it has been something that has um i've been able to drive a lot of value from a monetary standpoint later on in my life by being able to call on people who i had done favors to pass and then the fourth is literally never giving anyone power over your situation by saying it's anyone's fault but your own and um i will leave with i've said
(13:20) this before but one of my favorite quotes is that we are all self-made only millionaires and billionaires uh own it and so uh like everyone's like he's a self-made millionaire he's a self-made billionaire it's like that person's a self-made homeless person that person's a self-made average person like but they don't own that and there's a reason for it no one says it because the type of person who's going to say that they're self-made is going to have the habits and the outlooks that is going to achieve the things that they want
(13:48) and so um i will leave you with that as my four highest roi habits um if you have a manager or trainer or a partner or whatever i would highly highly recommend especially the first two they're the easiest things in the world to do get your bio clock like regular like you show up as a leader better you have more energy you have more focus people like you get so much stuff done it's like because i'm not [ __ ] exhausted all the time but like excuse me like i'm just not tired you know what i mean and so i can like work
(14:18) and get things done that are productive and effective uses of time because i'm just not exhausted and so like imagine if you like felt good all the time like you can do that it just comes from consistently going to bed at the same time dr cashy i will say one more thing dr cashy um jokes that so he's a my phd buddy who made all prestige labs and is a nutrition genius phd by 21 in biochemistry blah blah anyways he's like people just people just pay me to tell them to do things that they should already know how to do he's
(14:50) like i tell them to not eat like an [ __ ] and i tell them to act like an adult and go to bed on time they're like man like how do i how do i have more energy i've got all like i've i've taken all these stimulants and they're not working he's like why don't you try sleeping and then people sleep and then they get like they're like oh my god this changed my life it's like yeah like amazing it's like so i tell them to like eat consistently every day the same thing just eat consistently i don't even tell them what to eat and then all of a
(15:21) sudden they start getting healthy because they're just consistent with something right it doesn't matter what you're consistent with half the time being consistent is in and of itself something that most humans can't do so um i hope uh this provided value to you i said this on my instagram post today i kind of like it um may your desire be greater than your obstacles so lots of love everyone hope you guys have an amazing day and you crush your goals uh try out some of those uh habits try out some of those sevens i think that they
(15:47) are very high roi habits and i think that if you do them um your life will improve so have an amazing day catch you soon

"I'm Facing A Billion Dollar Decision" [Ep 012] - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tu6YDG0AZ5k

Transcript:
(00:00) and so right now I have2 billion do paths what's the worst case scenario if you do it anything that damages your reputation is irreversible cuz you only get one reputation and you literally can't bankrupt yourself out [ __ ] it one of the hardest decisions in entrepreneurship is deciding which path to follow especially when you have two or multiple good paths I'm at a point in my career where I do have a very large decision that I need to commit to for multiple years and I've been spending basically every waking hour trying to
(00:29) gather more data to make the right decision one of my favorite things to do when I do have big decisions is to change my environment and I think it happens multiple times my favorite place to think is actually on planes I often have very few distractions when I'm on planes and I quite literally get perspective like I'm flying up and I'm looking down at the earth I feel like I always make really good decisions when I'm in the air and uh it's actually something that I like really look forward to you know what I've been
(00:51) waiting for since I've been married going to Chili's bonda chilies I had like a seizure honestly I would go because I don't mind I don't care about the style of the restaurant but I do not like their food I think they have amazing chips great salsa and the fajitas are strong I hate that you go hard on this in front of people because then behind the closed doors you're like yeah it's not that good if there's any time like in the fine establishments that I go to that we Bunch you now like five times like we'll go and she'll be
(01:14) like it sucks right it sucks say it say it it's not as good as the finest dining in the world just say it I'll be like yes it's not as good she's like see see and then that's it for the rest of my life your chil [ __ ] and you get like a stomach ache from it and then you're like who are you talking about here yeah who are we talking about I think you're telling me your story so we just landed in San Diego and we are going to reals event which is a big publicly traded brokerage for real estate agents our really close friend
(01:43) Chiron svat is the president of the company he invited us out we're probably going to have dinner with him we're going to speak there tomorrow I will be making a presentation to help real estate agents sell more houses but it will not be about real estate it'll uh either soccer be great or somewhere in between Le's like I'm just how do I how do I stop doing all these routines I'm like I can't even start I like tried to smoke cigarettes to get addicted to them and I was like I just it was too hard it was just too hard to stick with it it's
(02:07) like every morning it's like whatever I [Music] forgot the hardest part about growth is that the better you get the bigger you get the bigger the opportunities are and the better they are I think the easiest slip Miss test is to determine how big of the opportunity is worth your attention so right now 10x is kind of my my lpness text like we're at 100 it's got to be a billion or more for it to be something that I want to dedicate time to and so right now I have what I would consider to be2 billion doll paths
(02:37) they're very different relatively irreversible one has potentially more upside but more risk the other one is more certain but has lower upside there's lots of things that can make a decision you're reversible there if it's a certain percentage of your net worth or capital I don't like making those kinds of bets this is a quote from Shan svat buddy of mine he said never want to bet the empire for a pot of gold you bet what you have and need for something you don't have and don't need it's never a good bet anything that damages your
(03:00) reputation is irreversible cuz you only get one reputation and you literally can't bankrupt yourself out of a bad reputation you can't make take reputational risk where there's only downside now if I were to say like I want to support this cause I might piss off some people but it'll move me towards a different group of people so then in that case that's that's a trade-off more than it's a risk and so that's it's different than what I'm talking about here and then you just have time you know time that you can't
(03:23) get back now every every like moment you spend always has the opportunity cost of what you could have done with that time to get a higher return I think the number presentation I have on YouTube is about that concept is the only base thing we have is time and we make trades for stuff and so the people who are better at trading it for more stuff get more stuff there is this story that Tony Robbins told that I really like that just kind of Illustrated this image is that like rich people make bets where they can't lose on either way like so
(03:49) there's this guy who knows that nickels nowaday are made with nickel or whatever the the material they make nickel with is more valuable than the cost of a nickel this billionaire he knows has taken the nickel he's putting it in storage as an investment because the day that they change or remove that nickel from currency cuz it makes no sense he'll melt it and get 40% on his money but there are investments that are high return low risk you want to find those bets how's it going I don't want to you're good man what's up I I'm a
(04:15) treasury founder we just find banks in the US that literally pay the highest rates on cash well give me your card I don't have a card I I got L here take a picture of me and message me and then the guy who managed my linkon will get it there you go oh we got to get a good lighting there it is do it right now so I can tell him I'll do it right now yeah if we can get more C more return on our cash we're in a Hot Zone a Hot Zone of recognition what's all like entrepreneurial people looks like it this gentleman no half measures that's
(04:39) right he knows I'll tell you that story man we're running gym launch making a lot of money I got asked to speak at this like personal trainer conference and I was like yeah sure I'll I'll talk like I wasn't being asked to speak I wasn't making content like this so like it wasn't like a normal I was like sure I'll come talk and I was like so what do you want to do he's like well I figur you just like give a lot of value and then you can you know present your thing or whatever and I was like okay cool cool I I made this really long
(05:01) presentation that was just like very very good and then at the end I had the full presentation webinar of how to how to sell like that I used to sell it before and I was like You guys probably don't need to see all this stuff right like okay you get it like personal training you know it's important you got to know how to sell got to understand the systems uh at the end I was like yeah and here's the price and I dropped it and I was like you I just I just went as fast as I could through it and I didn't even I said it like I'm saying it
(05:24) right now I didn't like actually say it and so then I revealed the price and so I did what would have been a 90-minute presentation pitch in like 15 minutes after giving 3 hours plus of value so I was like this should make sense I give a shitload of value and then I'll just soft toss it right and I got so much resistance from the crowd it was the biggest flop of a pration I've ever G my entire life I don't even think I think I made two sales I it was nothing right now I had done a half measure and so it's either sell or don't sell don't be
(05:50) in between you either give value or you sell [ __ ] don't try and mix them if we want to make commitments in anything or you're trying to go all in on a decision one of the best ways to do that is to eliminate the possibility of going back on it a lot of people spend most of their lives being half in half out which to me is just not in at all it just gives them an excuse to feel like they're making progress when they really aren't there's a lot of books that talk about going pro going all in burning the boats and I think they all kind of go
(06:15) along the same point which is that sometimes you have to make a bet and be willing to be wrong knowing that if you make no bet you're guaranteed to be wrong but yeah for tomorrow everybody there knows more about selling houses than I do and my proof point of that is that they have all sold more houses than I have so what am I going to teach them about selling houses right I think it would be silly for me to try and compete on that cuz there's other speakers who've both done it and been there more than me so I feel like that' be a
(06:36) terrible position to take what I am going to do is say if I were to start here's how I would win but if Selling Houses means winning it'll apply here's my girlfriend Riley how's it going Michael Michael nice to meet you sorry my hands are cold appreciate it dude you're killing the game man very nice to meet you night nice meeting you too Riley right see you guys when I was in high school I read this book called how to make friends and influence people and I think I think the second chapter or something is call people by their name
(07:02) it's their favorite word in the whole language and I was like oh that's interesting your favorite word in the entire language is your own name so you love hearing that word more than any other word why should say that a lot of times if somebody likes that word think about this from a leverage perspective if you haven't seen somebody in a year and then you show up at a conference and you're like Steve and he doesn't remember your name he loses all aage you're the good guy and so you have so much more leverage in the conversation
(07:24) for remember thank you for calling reservation center got to see if I can get in there with a tank top and Water Sandals thank you for calling Steak House Amy speaking how can we help you Amy how are you today hello am I'm doing okay how are you I'm good quick question for you I have reservation at 7:30 what's the dress code we don't turn anyone away unless you're wearing the following board shorts swimsuits and tank tops for well if you've never turned anyone away before then I might just have to risk it cuz I can't go back
(07:57) to my hotel in time no okay I'm going to say Amy said it was okay yeah no problem I'll get that sent over though and let them know he should be okay thank you so much Amy you're a lifesaver you're like that with the ice cream so we're on our way to an ice cream shop and it's it's closing like at the time we're about to get there leelo she was like we should call to make sure that like we can get in and I was like hey how's it going my wife needs ice cream I'm going to be in the dog house I was like what are the
(08:27) chances one in a million that you guys can stay up 5 minutes later so I can get some ice cream I was like I'll be in and out I'll be the fastest ice cream man you've ever seen and they were like okay but you just can't tell anyone I like it I will take you to the Grave except for this content that I'm making right now and she let us in and we got the Sundays I've done a lot of phone sales and I've done a lot of inperson sales and there's a lot of mini skills that you learn in sales that are useful in every other environment where you need
(08:53) to get people to do something that you want them to do the ideal way of doing is getting them to want to do the thing that you want them to do rather than and having them feel like they are doing you a favor the way that you ask the tone that you ask the laughs that you make the jokes that you make all of those micro things I do those things so that the person on the other end feels like if they see me in person it will be a positive experience and they want to have that reward and so they are willing to push or bend the rules a little bit
(09:20) so that I can do whatever it is that I'm trying to do or get in a restaurant or dessert or whatever it is people do nice things when they're in nice moods so it's like get them in a good mood first then ask for the nice [Music] thing said you made half the presentation last night yeah I kind of have this like process that sort of works I'll like outline what I'm going to say like far in advance and then the day before I'll change half of it oh we get the we get the VIP entrance okay and then we noticed at your presentation
(10:02) about 300 plus slides yeah I finished it like 20 minutes ago yeah it looks good oh looks good yeah and if it doesn't I'll survive okay usually I get more of my adrenaline now and by the time I get on stage it's like I'm done with it kind of thing it's always directly proportional to the prep yeah this will be the first time I've talked about any of the stuff that I'm talking about in a keyo so I like I love this tall boy D this is great get a little bit of sugar a little bit of caffeine a little bit of delicious and a little bit of uh [ __ ] it
(10:35) how many people 350 I had 100 slides he has 220 I have 300 oh my God 300 slides I'm looking forward to it oh thank you have you ever done a real estate audience no I don't think so I'm not I don't talk to real estate agents it's going to be useless for them they'll be like what a waste of an hour [ __ ] talk up from my friend Alex [Applause] horos a lot of you guys already know how to win because you know how to lose so flip it you guys know how to win better than I could ever tell you you measure your success by whether you completed
(11:17) the actions that would make it unreasonable that you will not fail and then you succeed by default and everyone here has things that they've written down from many of the talks of things that you want to do or want to think about or whatever I would encourage you to make that list of things that you will do and then when you go back to the same condition your same home your same house your same Market your same whatever you change your behavior and then that will show that you learned and you took one step to becoming the person
(11:41) that you ultimately want to be this stuff is all top of mine in terms of making actions that would make it unreasonable that I fail with a billion dollar decision is because that's actually a decision I'm making right now I'm at a point in my career where I have enough what I would consider singles doubles triples that I have decided to take a bigger swing I'll either win or I'll learn same as you so from the bottom of our heart Alex you impacted our life thank you man we appreciate you thank you guys thank you
(12:11) thank you thank you all I want to do when I up 01 of you at all you can be dude dude you can be 100x you stop it thank you Alex you're good Chris very nice to meet you appreciate you Katie appreciate you photo with you and Katie yeah sure it's still tra bro I followed you since you had about 50,000 subscribers I still back here to see you I'm going to earn that hat I bought one I'll go wear it someday thank God I love seeing mosy nation of the wild I love the hustle I love everyone coming up and and and sharing their
(12:47) their stories like that always makes my day I would say though do it in a place where you won't you know get put in handcuffs for sneaking in come up when you see me in public if you can I'm happy to say hi take pictures whatever don't go into areas where you're not supposed to go in order to try and hang out because it usually just doesn't end well the crowd is loving you very nice to meet you thank you so much appreciate it so that was that was great I did my keynote earlier in the day I think people liked it they may not have I
(13:14) think they sat through regardless and I think we're probably going to have the afternoon probably a couple hours probably walk around and then we'll head back to Las Vegas can see that see I almost content [Music] yep back in the day when I had one-on ones there was a one guy who I was like so like what have you done for personal Improvement like what do you you know have you he's like yeah you know it was so crazy like I realized if I if I don't watch Netflix as much while I'm working I get like so much more done I was like
(13:56) there's so many things wrong with that statement you were telling me probably just like just level one of idsc level two of idsc is that like you mentioned that you're doing that you were watching nflix in general while you were working point three is that you didn't actually say you were going to stop you just said that you cut back on how much Netflix you were watching while you were working and I just like there's so many stupidities interwoven into so few words I was flabbergasted so you're more productive when you don't watch Netflix
(14:27) movies all not as much yeah yeah okay as much as many shows in a row while you're being paid at your job yeah it's been [Music] great that's pretty that is pretty oh damn so if you're at the crossroads between one decision that you're trying to choose between two different paths if it's the first go round I would encourage you to take the lower risk path that has a higher chance of success if it's a business there are stories of just unbelievable entrepreneurs but what you don't he is the tens of thousands of
(15:09) entrepreneurs who make that massive bet and then lose everything and lose five eight years of their lives if you are going to make the big swing and kudos to you it's an absolutely personal decision burn the boats go all in fully commit eliminate Alternatives no half measures because what I can guarantee you is that if you are going after the big swing the way to guarantee that it does not work is to go half in so if you're going to win make it unreasonable that anything that was in your control was not controlled for and then only lose for
(15:39) things that were not under your control what do you think top five for me I go Matrix all time I'd be willing to put Dark Knight is number two it's just like he's such a good villain it's just like he was just the perfect villain the intro scene is just like one of the alltime best scenes ever I really like old but I do like Gladiator Russell Pro do you have one that's not like action heavy probably my favorite comedy [ __ ] no it's too hard 40 Old Virgin Wedding Crashers super bad and surprise uh bridesmaides I cried during bridesmaides
(16:10) it's like I couldn't breathe I was dying yeah I mean I went cuz a buddy of mine at the job that I was at was like let's go see it and I was like fine so I like had a couple drinks and like went to the movie theater and I like was hyperventilating cuz I couldn't [ __ ] stop laughing

10x Revenue with 1 New Sales Process (You Can Steal It) - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1UhvBSQFy6A

Transcript:
(00:00) I crossed $100 million in net worth by age 32 I sold my first big company for 46.2 million and the reason we're able to do that is because we know how to grow companies and so now I buy companies at a lower price I grow them and then we sell them and so I want to talk to you about one of the companies we just bought uh we bought them a year and a half ago I think or a year ago uh they had 14 locations so it was a chain of brick and mortar and since then we've gone from 14 to 32 locations and the reason we're able to do that is because we focused on the sales process and
(00:32) through a process that I want to walk you through something that I call the diagnostic sale we're able to 10x the recurring revenue of the business across all the locations so before we get into the nitty-gritty of the story let me just walk you through the steps in the diagnostic process first is we like to have some sort of pre-sale questionnaire which the purpose of that is to get more information that arms the salesperson so they know who they're talking to what their pains are but from the sales perspective for them they also increase their awareness of the problem second is
(00:57) we get their information in their credit card which is key and I'll explain why it lat uh third is we want to understand what the current situation is where are you at today then we have your desired state so where would you like to be at and then what's the obstacle why aren't you there and then finally once we have these big three we present the desired State and our vehicle to overcome the obstacle and we tie our price to the way that we're going to get them there and then finally we give them an incentive
(01:21) to prepay so here's the five steps that we follow to actually get this done so number one is that we secret shopped the business so we actually looked into it we went there by the the way you should secret shop your own business highly recommend doing it you'll be horrified by what you hear your sales guys say you're like I thought we had a script what are you even doing number two is from there this is basically information gathering we figure out what the constraint is okay where do we think there's big opportunities in the business now you should think about yourself as your own business consultant if you could buy
(01:48) your business today and look at your business what would be the no duh thing that you would do now for this particular business we thought that they had an offer constraint which really came down to packaging we had offer SL packaging because fundamentally we're not going to change the core of the business we're not going to all of a sudden start selling soap when you sell HVAC like that's not going to happen right so the core of the business can remain unchanged it's how we're going to package the services we deliver or that the services we sell to a customer how are we going to get them to perceive
(02:18) what we're selling we gathered the data we figured out the constraint was that they should get way more re bookings which I thought was an offer and packaging issue which is we need to sell the solution sell the goal and so number four is okay if we assume that we're going to make this new transition into this new new offer new packaging we have to anticipate so you we call it killing zombies uh which is one way of putting it you anticipate the obstacles or objections that people are going to throw at you ahead of time write this in
(02:43) neon marker above your sales team which is it's way harder to get someone to buy after you presented the price because now they're like he's trying to sell me so we have to counter that before we become salesp people in their mind we are a trusted expert ideally if we're positioned well and you should be that way if you know what you're talking about and I like to use the frame of childlike curiosity I always tilt my head I probably even did it subconsciously just now you tilt your head when you ask the question because it's non-threatening you're like huh
(03:11) that's weird what changed between then and now just so I understand then they can tell you rather than be like you said that your husband says he supports you you can't say that now you have to buy doesn't work that way if you win the argument in a sale you lose the sale the only way that you win the sale is being willing to lose being right and so the fifth step and this is the ongoing step is that you implement the diagnostic sales process so it's implementation so now that I just outlined the five steps let me deep dive into the implementation into the actual business and how we did this with this particular business when
(03:42) we bought them I spent four hours with our director of sales and we outlined the new sales process we wanted to implement and as soon as we implemented that sales process we 4X LTV progresser meaning how much people paid us it went from 200 to 800 so really big jump and we the crazy thing about this is that we didn't change what we delivered we only changed how we presented it and so this is the key of how we create value how we scale companies how we grow companies and many companies keep these things as
(04:14) Secrets uh as their special sauce and I just fundamentally believe that the more we put out the more we get back and say that's why I operate this way all right so I will hold nothing back and this is something I call the diagnostic sales process now to be very clear the diagnostic sales process is one of two two different sales or maybe three different sales processes big picture that you can have in a business one is a transactional sale all the way on this extreme so on one side you've got transactional sales and on this side you've got Enterprise sales which is like uh
(04:49) relational sales like if you think about like you're selling some big Fortune 500 company you have to get stakeholders involved get budget approval there's all that stuff and on transactional side you've got like High Velocity sales we're talking 20 30 minute sales a guy who stands in of the car wash sells Car Wash somebody sells gym memberships transactional and then you've kind of got like this Middle where you might sell something that's a little bit higher ticket but it's a little bit more custom all right now what we did was I
(05:13) took their sale from here a purely transactional sale and moved it towards custom all right now in a transactional sale you typically fit the customer to the product and so let's say that I sell Pence all right so I sell Pence if somebody comes in I'm going to basically spend all my effort listening to what they say they want and then telling them how this pen fits their needs or I have to basically say your needs are wrong let me educate you more and this actually solves all your problems right and so those are pretty much the only two approaches you can take in a transactional sale now the advantages of having this type of sale is that it's
(05:50) really fast uh they tend to be lower ticket in general uh and from an operational perspective in the business you don't need to personalize anything and so you get the sales team and the Sal sales process to basically Orient everyone like a funnel down to one solution and then you just make a ton of these Solutions and you get lots of efficiencies because you only have to produce one thing this the custom sale is a harder sale sorry easier sale to do but harder on the operational side and so the magic happens when you can actually Bridge the product component of
(06:23) transactional which you say okay we only sell these types of widgets this is the only thing we deliver but I can do it in a way that feels custom feels personalized all right so I'm going to give you two examples and I'll explain this one in a second this chart that I have here which if you could take your recurring revenue from that to that just by changing how you sell if you'd want to do that hang tight we're going to break that in the process so if I had because I did this in the gym in the gym world too which is part of why our gyms make more money so a
(06:53) traditional sale would look something like this someone comes in so this is traditional and you say we have a membership that's you know whatever $99 per month all right that's your membership and you say our membership has this this this and this and you want that right because it's going to help you accomplish all your dreams okay sometimes you get people sometimes you don't what I do we do something called a diagnostic and so the first thing is that when the person walks in the door we get them to fill out a pre-sale
(07:28) questionnaire and so that's like an application in a digital process but an inperson process it follows the same logic which by the way internet businesses follow local businesses local businesses can also model internet businesses when you find out something works in one place which I think has been one of the big advantages of I've had in business is I try and put it in a completely different place and it often works too if you understand the concept and so we fill out a pre-sale questionnaire now the pre-sale
(07:49) questionnaire simply walks them through all the reasons they walked in today and it ask them the same question in multiple different ways so it's like hey like what brought you in today what's the current problem you're doing dealing with how long You' been dealing with it if you had to quantify how much this has cost you financially what would it be uh if it continued for five years how much worse would the situation be and so the whole point is we're trying to agitate tame we're trying to bring attention to this problem and Elevate its importance
(08:16) so that's what the pre-sale questionnaire does now the second thing is we get info and this is very key so when someone comes in after that we say hey I want to I want to set up your account profile and so when you do that you collect their information and this is the key part you get their credit card now you're like wait a second I'm getting a credit card but I haven't sold anything exactly and you do that so that when you do sell something later you don't have to ask for it now you get the pre-sale they're like wow I really do need this thing you say hey let me complete your customer profile just standard procedure no big deal all right
(08:47) then you get their info now if they're like well I don't want to give you my credit card you're just like it's just how the system works it's how we complete profiles and then they'll give it to you all right so from there this is the this is where the special the special magic that's unique to each individual business happens so in the weight loss business I want to understand where their goal at so you say what's current and then four what's desired where are you now where would you like to be and then this one you ask them say what's the
(09:24) obstacle what's in between these two things is the obstacle right current I've got an obstacle getting the way of I desired that's all we're asking in the process now in weight loss and in most businesses the thing the person thinks is in the way is often not the real thing in the way and that's because they've never had this conversation before they clearly haven't solved the solution and that's why they're coming to you and so you want to just get their words more so so that you can explain it back to them using the language they gave you all right and so in the weight
(09:54) loss world for example instead of selling a membership I would say okay well it sounds like you need these three things Fitness Nutrition accountability Fitness wise you need to work out X days a week nutrition wise you need to eat this food at this time and we can help you meal prep the stuff so you got when you go to restaurants you can still stick on it and you need accountability because if you don't if you do if if I give you the best fitness plan and the best nutrition plan but you don't show up doesn't matter right accountability
(10:18) is what makes the whole thing work great finished nutrition accountability easy three-step framework fantastic now this is where it becomes diagnostic now most customers and this is why this is where the magic happens is that even if you still deliver the same thing so fundamentally when I switch the sales process the gyms remain the same they still have workouts they still have nutrition help they still have accountability nothing changed but how we present it changes and so rather than saying hey I'm going to sell a four-week thing or a six week thing I say hey
(10:47) you're currently 200 lb Okay now what's your high school weight she says I want to I want to get to 140 you say okay cool you want to get to 140 this is your desired okay so we have a 60 pound difference now what we found is that we don't want people to lose more than pound and a half to two pounds a week all right so let's just be conservative and call it one and a half so then I take out my calculator and I say what's 1 and a half time 60 which would be other way around it' be 60 divid by one and a half which is 45 okay so 45 weeks is how
(11:24) long it's going to take us to take you from 200 to 140 so you lose a pound and a half a week it's going to take 4 5 weeks and so six present price in relation to goal so you say awesome so we currently charge 99 bucks a week we can get you there in 45 weeks which means it's $4,500 and that means and for us I added a a guarantee on the back end which which said hey if you show up to the workouts for next 45 weeks and you log your food and you don't lose the weight I'll keep working with you for free until you do
(12:00) so that means this is the translation this is the key part in the script so that means when you pay this $4,500 it means that you can count that weight for good you can put it out of your mind you pay me this money we're going to get there one way or another As Long as You Follow the steps you're G to follow the steps right great and so here you're trying to sell 99 bucks a month or or whatever this would be 99 bucks a week if if I was doing equivalent pricing all right so this would be like a semi-private program but by positioning it this way
(12:27) I'm not selling a membership anymore I'm selling exactly what they want and putting a price tag on it and saying you want to get to 140 it's going to take this long and I'll guarantee that you that you'll get there provided you follow these steps and then they say wow that's awesome you say well if you want I can save you a little bit of money you want to save a little bit of money and they're like yeah I want to save a little bit of money well if you prepay you can save 10% today so I can save you 450 bucks you
(12:58) want to do that that's what most people do great you want to you want to use the card you have in file done so that's that's the process now I took this process and applied it to a completely different service business that we own that's a chain that this is a little bit more Medical but the concept still applied which is and this is the key part is you have to figure out for whatever it is that you sell what the current is versus what the desired is so if I were uh a painter all right and I was painting houses sounds crazy right say hey so you currently have this thing you
(13:38) want a completely painted house and so the like now for them this is like more us do it for you rather than uh self-service like I'm going to have to like they you're not painting your house and them helping you so they're actually going to paint the house so then we just try and think how can we how can we how can we sell to goal and break it into a price that we tie to that and so it' be like okay so we're going to need four coats of paint and it's going to take this period of time and then at that point your your whole house is going to be weatherproofed and so
(14:07) that means that when you pay this price that's what you're going to get by this date and if we don't get it done by that date I'm going to give you this and that way we can relieve their risk that it's not going to happen and we tie the purchase to the outcome so this particular business when I bought it or bought into it um it was a business that they had really good lead gen and they have a good product but they didn't have good packaging and I saw the opportunity because I knew that if I installed my sales process into their business I could make it make a lot more money and
(14:42) so if you have the opportunity to like Forex a business without opening new locations you do that and so that's more or less what we did so I actually wrote down the new sales process took me four hours so I wrote down the new sales process and then I presented to the management team and they were like wow this is the most valuable thing we've ever had happen to our business and I said great so let me know when you do it across all the locations and let's keep buying and opening new ones and so 18 months later we have 32 locations and
(15:06) the recurring Revenue in that time period has gone up and the average revenue per customer went from $200 to $800 from this one process and that was because before this they were selling oneoff transactions they were saying hey we'll do this service for you so think of it like botox or we're going to do filler or we're going to do something this one time and so rather than just say sure give us a call when you want it again which is pretty much what the process was before this I say hey you want to look a certain way you're not here because you want filler you're here because you want to look a certain way so if I show this chart to you of faces
(15:46) and filler densities where where do you see yourself on here currently now you let them self identify you can't be like look Pi you're ugly you can't say that so you got to say where are you on this chart and then they say this now in the weight loss sale I got them to step on the scale the scale called you fat not me all right so maybe just point to the third party not me so so so you get them to pick how ugly they are all right and then you say how pretty do you want to be now everyone's going to say I want to be super pretty but here's the beautiful thing when they pick how pretty they want to be they're the one who set the
(16:16) goal and that means that the price came from them and you know where I picked this up was yogurt stores so one of the things I thought was genius about like Yogurt Land and things like that was if if you go to a store and then they fill up your stuff behind the counter and then they say hey it's 8 bucks you're like man what the hell this place is so expensive but if they give you the cup and you fill it up and you put it on the scale you're like man I'm a fat ass same pricing but because I had control over
(16:43) what I picked I'm the one who's responsible for the decision and so by saying where are you on this chart and again this is where the magic happens I say current desired that's where the thinking behind how I'm going to structure a sale is where like that's where the that's where the experience that's where the expertise that's where it comes in this is the process and hopefully you guys can take this for your business and think like okay what's current what do they really want they're not buying lip filler they're not buying a painted house they're buying an image in their mind of what they want that
(17:12) house to signify or what it means to them and this lady is not buying filler she's trying to buy a certain look she wants people to think about her a certain way she want when people walk when she walks in the room she wants guys to turn their heads though because she's probably getting a little older they're not turning their heads as much and she still misses that and she' pay anything to get that so say you're ugly now how pretty do you want to be we say cool so for us to get you from here to here it's going to take us 45 weeks it's
(17:35) going to take us Botox filler and you know plastic surgery whatever we're going have to hit you with a pretty shovel and bring you back to life all right we're going to have to do this and it's going to take this many weeks for us to reverse this level of Aging or at least take these Crow feed out or whatever it is and so we tie where you're at to where you want to go and then our solution is only the vehicle that delivers this outcome and so that is the moment that you present the price because they picked where they were where they want to go and then you as the expert explain the path to getting
(18:04) there so they picked the before and after and you just use your expertise of this is what we found best to get people to hear Who start where you're at and so we found out that this opportunity existed within this particular business because I had my sales director secret shop them so mind you this is Brick and mor chain we have a lot of locations so we could sneak our way in it's harder if you have like a you know four sales guys who do all the sales they'll just tell the owner right so we wanted a secret shop before we actually completed the investment and so uh when he went in he
(18:31) was I I asked him so I went through this checklist I was like okay so did they give you some sort of pre-sale question he was like no I was like okay great I like did you did they ask you for your credit card or did they ask you for your information or anything before you got the service and he was like No And I was like fantastic what else what else did they do it's like did they have you set you know pick uh where you're at and where what your goal is he said yeah they did have me uh pick where I was at but not where I wanted to go so they
(18:56) just had him pick okay how ugly are you and he was like okay now again not completely flawed I want to be really clear here like this is a at 14 locations they're not they're not idiots they had the pain we agitated the pain they said listen this is how ugly you are on this scale that we invented and you're here you're a seven ugly great so he checked this but he didn't get to say where he wanted to be so then from there he just went right into the service and then when he came out he just gave them
(19:22) the card to pay for the service and that was it and he just walked out the door and I was like wait so they didn't they didn't actually like ask you to buy a package or get into some membership or anything and he was like well they tried to upsell me this one product at one point but this was the price point and the price point was like 20 bucks or something and I knew what the average customer is worth which was like 200 at the time I was like this like by the way if you're going to do upsells you want the price point to usually be usually be five times more than the current price
(19:52) because if you get 20% of people so customers are fractal so we're going to go into a little side quest here but it'll be worth it for you since we're talking about sales so you've heard of 8020 right so you've got 100 people right the top 20% you've got the 80 underneath right these are the people 8020 have five times the spending power of these people and so because of that if you get 20% of people to buy something that's five times as expensive so let's say my current thing is $1,000 if I'm going to have an upsell I want my upsell to be $5,000 because if 20% take it then it's
(20:29) 20% time 5,000 which means I add $11,000 to my average ticket so I go from $2,000 or sorry $1,000 per customer to $2,000 per customer and so when I heard that their upsell was 10% it'd be like having it' be like my upsell is 100 bucks okay fine maybe 20% take that so I I go from a th000 to 1,20 who cares like what's like why bother right and fundamentally again smart business owners and they were upselling product which means there's no real delivery in a brick and Mort service business so they could just hand
(21:06) the product make the money and I think they were using it more for commissions for their staff to increase the average pay which a different objective entirely and totally fine but I was only looking at this from how do I take customers who are worth $200 and make them my goal is to get them worth a th000 currently it's $800 I'm GNA keep getting there until we get to a th but I think that we can get it to a th and so we secret shop them number one which by the way if you have a team of people who are currently selling your
(21:36) stuff secret shop them and then be horrified by what you listen to on the phone or what you see in person because you have this beautiful idea of what you think your sales process is and it's a nightmare it's an absolute nightmare if they remember half of it you'll be stoked and so if you run an environment especially in a in a lower wage environment so if you're brick and mortar you have a chain of of locations and you have to take low skill labor and teach them a sales process you've like the the expertise in sales comes down to
(22:04) how easy and simple you can make the process and so that comes down to like can I automate parts of the p uh the point of sale so that they can't move forward without doing this checkbox right and by doing this chalk boox they have to ask the question so it forces script adherence now training sales not into this video but you want to basically repeat the process over and over and over again until they're sick of it until they say like yes Mom would you like to have do you have your credit you want to use the credit card on on file like until they're saying it like they can they can breathe it they can
(22:34) think they can say without thinking about it that's when you've maybe just started to have a te a team that's that's well trained now that we finished these seven uh pieces of the diagnostic I want to add one more bonus because you're like wait a second so where's the where's the recurring Revenue great observation Andrew okay so so number eight is transition to recurring all right I remember this I'll give you two separate stories that'll drive this home so A friend of mine has uh a a recurring membership that he sells and he sells it
(23:03) at uh I think he sell at 300 bucks a month and he couldn't get people stick past three months and so he tried all these different gimmicks and things and he just couldn't crack three months of LTV now that could have been a pricing issue whatever so this is what he did he stopped selling it at $300 a month month to month and started selling as a $110,000 program with 36 month of Interest refinancing and so when people bought they were buying a $10,000 price point but they got an amazing aming payment plan and so he didn't change anything about what he sold but that took his
(23:34) average customer from 3 months to 8 months so we're talking about a $900 so 3 * 300 to 8 * 300 2400 that kind of change in a business life-changing in terms of how much money you can make the second one was I had a different friend who had a continuity program uh he was an uh agency and what he did was he realized he had turn in his business and so he said you know people are way less likely to turn out of a payment plan same as is the other one then they are out of a monthly recurring Revenue stream and so what you call it to the
(24:03) customer can affect the likelihood that they pay but as far as the business is concerned you just want payments that are regular and all you do to take a program and take it from Rec from a payment plan to recurring in terms of how it actually looks and feels is you just put an automatic recurring at the end of the program and so when someone buys this big thing and you make a payment plan and then it recurs into the exact same price as the payment plan you just move the pieces around but the likely they stick is way higher and so
(24:32) that's exactly what we did as the last step in the diagnostic sales process and I wanted to highlight this point for you because I've done it in every business and so we give someone the option to prepay you can give if you want a little bit more aggressive you get 20% off if they prepaid today if you want to have one step down below that which is what I like to do you give them 10% off if they do half down and they make the rest as payments and if they still can't do that then I take the whole thing and I spread it over let's say 45 weeks and so I'd say okay it's 99 bucks a week 99 a week
(25:03) and there you go now they go from 99 a week to 80 bucks a week if they prepay the whole thing and they go from 99 bucks a week to 90 a week if they prepay half and here's the key part is that when we present the price you present it at the highest rate so you present it at the payment plan let me walk I'll walk you through this because I think it's important well I'm going to put it here and so I don't have to flip screens for you all right so you have your full boat I'll say full interest price so for us in our example is 4500
(25:36) bucks all right 45 weeks times 99 roughly all right so this is our full boat price we have our prepayment discount in full which is minus 20% all right so for us it's going to be minus what is that 900 yeah 900 from there so that's 5600 sorry other way uh 3600 3600 if they do half down you say I I'll let you save uh 450 bucks so 10% so 4050 Z all right so this is 10% minus 10% that's- 20% now the reason this is so important is think about the alternative think about and this is what most people do so listen to me Andrew most people do this they present the
(26:21) price as $3600 and then they say oh well we have payment plans that we have interest on and so we do we do have 10% interest if you can put half down and we have 20% interest if you put uh nothing down and you just go onto a straight payment plan well which one would you rather buy if on one hand you have a $4,500 price tank which anchors you high and you say or you can get a benefit for prepaying today rather than you think about 3600 you're considering it and then they say oh it's even more even though you're just considering this tag guess what you
(26:53) have to pay way more now be because you can't afford it you have to pay more Banks do it all the time and guess what everyone hates Banks so if banks want to fix their process Mr Bank maybe this will work who knows anyway point is is that this is how you present the price because you get the benefit of a price anchor and you get to be the good guy for getting them to pay upfront rather than the bad guy for them not being able to so we're going to we're going to go through step eight in uh in the more transition uh process for the sale and
(27:22) so I want to just walk you through step downs and so this is super important to understand from a sales perspective so we'll call this sales step downs and uh this is by the way a preview for my next book coming out $100 million yeah anyways so so Sal step Downs is one of the things that we have so obviously the first thing we're going to present is a prepayment all right which is pay in full today prepaid y by the way you've probably noticed from any of my content I don't say paidon fools and that's because that's a that's a Salesman term not a customer benefit if
(27:54) you prepay you get a benefit whereas Pon full is like I got all the cash to front good for me and so I have trained myself because I used to say pton fools piff skis P you know whatevers pifs like all of that stuff I used to do as a sales team sales leader and then I also heard my team saying that to customers be like hey if you want to pay in full today like it's just like kind of gross and so I prefer to say like hey we have a prepayment discount and so training that just little Pro tip for you so number one is prepay number two is we do
(28:24) discount uh with partial so this is this is the half down oops half down here you can also do in-house well this is whatever sorry this is credit card or third party so if you have like most most businesses that sell legitimate Services have third-party financing solutions that already exist and so I promise you there is a banker somewhere who started a business to service this Emerging Market of whatever it is that you do who says I'll bet you I can help Finance transactions now the prices they charge for that financing will differ based on
(29:01) how risky your business is and so like there's financing for casinos like if you want to get if you want to get a loan to go gamble more like there's financing for that but they will charge you a lot of money right and so like that being the extreme on the other hand if you want to finance a house there's obviously a huge mortgage industry and so from every step in between there are Partners who will step in as third party and take on that risk for you for a price and so I prefer can I get the prepayment because it's easiest and fastest if not usually have a third party that I set up so that my customers
(29:31) can get financing if we don't move past either of these two things then I try to go with a partial with some level of discount not as much as here but a little bit and if they still say no then I go for continuity which is why don't we just make a payment plan on the thing and in this particular business because what they were doing before was simply rebooking people for another session of service we just had this be the automatic like everyone gets rebooked and that would became that became an internal saying like I like having mantras uh within sales teams which is
(30:05) like everyone buys something like everyone buy something there's no reason someone should not buy something and so sure we'll get them a prepay maybe a partial okay fine we'll do a payment plan that's whatever call it you know 250 uh times four great that's our $ th000 that's our th000 plan that we're getting people to buy and you pay 250 today and then three more times and you can do it every other month if it's a more uh intermittent service whatever just match the payments to when they get delivery and then finally if they're like well I can't do any of those things
(30:34) it's like cool let's just let's just book the next time you want to come in that's it and so this is the final of the process in terms of in terms of the step Downs that we might offer someone we just walk through this whole process and you're like wow maybe that's a lot of work I have to use my brain power but welcome to business but let me tell you why it's worth it so these are the actual stats and I put the numbers without the names to keep it nice open loop for you so number one is that they had 9% of Revenue uh that was recurring
(31:00) within this product line all right so they had 9% that was curring after we implemented this process 60% they took this 9% to 60% of this product line within the company so awesome number two they had basically no membership at all because they just weren't it wasn't even an option not really and we were to push that to 30 that's a 30 30% into memberships this included payment plans this is just memberships and then we went from getting one additional extra visit on average per person meaning two to getting four to six visits per customer by introducing
(31:45) this sales process and from a money perspective we went from $220,000 when we uh bought the business so mind you this business made a lot more money than this single product line or this service line but this is where I want wanted to invest my time because I thought there was a huge opportunity here because I saw from the secret shoer from the constraints I thought this was a big area of attack and so they're only 20,000 a month which business the size is not a lot and then however many however we dots this later over 250,000 per month in
(32:17) added and it continues to grow and this compounds and that's the that's the beauty of this type of sales process and repackaging of what someone already sells and so we went from 9 to 60 0 to 30% on memberships from one visit to four to six visits and from 20 to 250,000 so we more than 10x the recurring revenue of this business by following a diagnostic process rather than just selling some traditional one-off thing I have two books on Amazon $100 million offers $100 million leads you can go check them out uh if you have are completely poor uh my podcast has them for free too you can check those

The REAL Reason You’re Not Making as Much Money As You Want - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNiXk_3C_Io

Transcript:
(00:00) you're not making as much money as you want because you're working on the wrong stuff you're chasing opportunities rather than solving problems so a problem is something that threatens the future livelihood of your business so it decreases the likelihood that your business will continue to exist so for example if you get customer complaints from your product that is a problem if your processor you know relationship becomes a red flag that is a problem your sales team starts dropping conversions that is a problem these are
(00:27) things that threaten whether or not you're going to be live tomorrow now the second bucket are missed opportunities these are things that you are not doing but you should be doing in your business that could expand or grow your business here is the fundamental problem in my life I have almost equally colored them the same as just things to do I need to fix the sales team I also need to get this email follow-up campaign redone because it sucks right or it's not there to begin with we need to get this retargeting across all platforms why
(01:00) aren't we doing that and you probably have this list of what I consider should do right I know I should be doing all these things but I'm not and so this is where this gets really painful for the entrepreneur myself included which is we only have limited resources but our list of should do is unlimited the amount of opportunities taken to their natural extreme is that you have a business that selles everything to everyone think about it at every Point there's there's oh we could have a product here there that's a opportunity for Revenue
(01:31) expansion oh we should add in this other channel that's a possibility or opportunity for Revenue expansion and so what ends up happening is that over time Everything feels like something that you should do and then over time your list just gets longer and longer and longer and unless you delineate which thing is a problem and which thing is a missed opportunity you will get way overwhelmed so this is why I think this is so crucial missed opportunity are typically more fun they're exciting they're new things they're shiny and
(02:06) that's why us entrepreneurs love pursuing them the reason that I talk about focus and the woman in the red dress so often is it's because it's the thing that I struggle with to this day most often and so half of these sermons probably more than half are actually just me yelling at me to be clear now these are really fun and exciting and they tend to be around the things that you love and so if you're a product person you're probably going to have a lot of product should dos if you're a marketer you're probably have a lot of
(02:34) marketing related should do if you're customer success related same thing so if you're Finance same thing whatever your thing is tends to be the thing that you like doing the most of and that's where you tend to see the most missed opportunities because that's where you spend the most time you can always see the next step The Next Step the next step and you keep wanting to grab those other things and bring them into your business because you see how much money that we're quote leaving on the table problems on the other hand suck and
(03:00) they're not fun and it's usually you going into something that you set up once and having to fix you thought it was going to work but it's not being executed properly or there's some key problem that that you didn't expect it's basically you did something a new piece of information came to light and now you have to do something about it the reason beyond what I just said of why you shouldn't focus on the missed opportunities because there's obviously so many of them and it taken to the National extreme it's literally
(03:24) everything is also because when you prioritize Miss opportunities you grow your business but guess what else happens you grow your problems and so if you have not solved your problem before growing the business that problem just gets bigger some of you guys may have noticed that I've been making a little bit less content lately and so I've been super busy on this big missed opportunity I put it that way and I've been pouring tons and tons and tons of hours into this big new project like massive thing for 2025 and Lea basically came to me and
(04:00) she was like I'm dying over here like I need your help I need you back right like your head's not in the game like you're like we're we're doing business every day and you're over here trying to build the future and the thing is is this is not a problem to be solved it's a dichotomy to be managed if you're the Visionary entrepreneur in the business it's normal for you to live 3 months 6 months a year plus out that's normal but you can't take your eye off the ball from today and so for me this was a pendulum that I was swinging too far in
(04:27) this direction and so she was like dude you need to make some content you haven't like you're not you're not like you're not spending any time on it and so um to give you context I think over the last two weeks we've had have we even had a a scheduled recording session yeah so we've had about one we've had one recording session last week and this is now one today and the the ones that I was going to I wasn't as prepared as I should have been uh for those sessions I was like all right all right what are we what are
(04:56) we talking about today and you know the team kind of basically uh gave me gave me the talking point point and so for you guys it may not be content right it may be you need to make ads it may be you need to be looking at the outbound team it may be our customer success is failing whatever that thing is it was the thing that's hard right and so for me like I like despite the fact that everyone thinks that I'm a content creator this is not my main job all right and so my life is not as you know as much as I try right as much as I try
(05:24) to make more cont everybody like it's not it's not the main thing still and so um but I let it get away from me and so the thing is is like I've given I've learned to over time give myself a little bit of Grace in saying this I will never solve this it is unsolvable but it's simply about percentages of the pie that I'm going to allocate to Now versus the future and I get a little bit too over indexed on the future that's in my nature and so I have to overemphasize the present because this if this doesn't work then that will
(05:56) never happen anyways and I think Leila has always been so grounded in today and I've been so grounded in the future that's been our yin and yang but we both try and mean the I have to pull her towards future be like hey let's like this is where we're going this is we have to build it this way to get to here and she's like yeah but that's a massive pain for me and I will tell you something that I have and now it's taking me far too long to learn is that it's easier to solve small problems than big problems and so when we were
(06:24) thinking about putting the sequence of what things we're going to prioritize by the way the TLD are of this is this is strategy strategy is prioritizing limited resources against unlimited opportunities these are things that you could do with these resources versus the resources you have and so if you have a fixed pool of resources the first things and this is like I'm relooking at my my list right now are the things that probably suck they are the problems and that is where you can spend or should spend in my
(06:55) opinion your time because when you solve your problems guess what else also happens you grow you would like my team to go over that list of things that you have to grow your business the things that are the missed opportunities and also the problems and give you a step-by-step plan to solve those because we probably have solved them for businesses just like yours because we have a lot of different companies probably bigger than yours in the portfolio and so if you'd like that uh we are holding uh workshops here in
(07:22) Vegas this my actual portfolio team we hold them one or two times a month uh and so if that's at all interesting you can go to acquisition. comom and you can click the scale button and uh if your business qualifies we'd love to see you out here opportunities can grow your company problem solved also grow your company but when you solve problems as you grow you get growth through getting better when you grow through capturing missed opportunities you grow through doing more and to be fair I have no problem with growing through doing more
(07:54) but I do have a problem when more also creates more problems and so if the goal of the entrepreneur is to allocate resources across the entire company to achieve the best returns then we should be allocating more of our time towards solving problems that are coming up on a daily basis when you have a business that no longer has problems you will grow by default and so my allocation of resources has gone in this direction now I want to zoom out and make this super Tactical for you you probably look at data hopefully if you follow my stuff to
(08:30) any degree on a regular basis now if you're earlier on you have to go gather that data from tons of places as you get more advanced that data becomes pushed to you via dashboards or direct reports people present those things on meetings it's the first slide and then you talk about the data so I want to give you a 2011 level hack here that will change how you run your business number one the data that you choose to display must be there for a reason one of the biggest problems that I see across our portfolio
(08:58) companies and even within our holding compan company is that my direct reports and my employees often over report because they know I love data and so they like look at all of this data that we have but if you present me a piece of data and a change in that data does not result in a change in Behavior it is a waste of time and so right now if you look at the data and you're like okay we're trending in this direction if you if you ask the hypothetical question if we Max this out would it change what we're doing if the answer is no then you
(09:32) should stop looking at that piece of data it's noise not signal and so when you're making the decisions for your business the data that you look at you should clearly know and your team should know what Behavior this data influences if our average view duration drops then it could be from a number of reasons but if it does drop are we going to do something about it and what are we going to do this also will Target your discussions or Orient your discussions with your team and so if they come to you and say hey we want
(10:06) to run a meeting about this the end result of every meeting should be a change in Behavior it should be what are we going to do now if someone says Hey I want to report these trends that we're seeing cool and I'll give you a really recent one that happened I had a vendor for a platform a while ago and the vendor was telling me hey we should go for shorter shorter versions of this type of content and I was like okay why and he said well because when we shorten it a higher percentage of people watch it or consume
(10:41) it and I said why do I care what does the view duration or listen duration have to do with any of the metrics that we have in this business can you prove to me that us getting a higher percentage of people viewing a shorter piece of content in some way drives our business now if he then said yes pieces of content that have higher average view durations or average listen durations then create more shares then I would say got it done we're doing it but if you just report oh we should do this because it improves this metric how does that
(11:16) metric tie to getting us more customers or making customers worth more if you can't tie why this thing or this metric that we somehow track tracks to this I do not care and the reason I think this is so important is that we have such limited attention in business every single day that if someone's going to buy or bid for our attention they better damn well have a good reason for it and also your team is limited as well they are human beings too and so they have many people they've got slack messages they've got emails they've got meetings
(11:50) and then they have the work that they're actually supposed to do and so if you have a quarterly for example and you have your whole team there if you are aren't clear about what change in Behavior the data is going to create you are wasting your time and theirs if after that day or after that meeting you go back to business you might as well have just taken the day off wrapping this back to problems and missed opportunities you will probably have significantly more data around your problems than you will around missed
(12:24) opportunities missed opportunities are going to be purely hypothetical we think if we had this percentage of people to convert and they pay this price this is the revenue uplift that's that that we have potential to capture all of this is hypothetical fine on the problem side we have to look at what thing we're going to change to fix this problem and so this is how we do it we have four steps all right so if you're writing this at home then this is this is the writer Downer part number one is the condition or the goal that we are trying to the
(12:55) problem we're trying to solve all right this is how this is current this is desired cool next thing is what is the action what are we going to do and this is to be clear a hypothesis our turn rate is at 5% okay we hypothesize that if we do a one-onone reach out to every customer as they enter our you know buy our product we will decrease turn that's the hypothesis it's an action tied with what we expect and the reason for taking this cost on because it will cost you you money to do this cost resources the third bucket and this is
(13:34) the fun one did we do it or not so this is the before and after so we have the problem here's how we hypothesize it we have what data that we want to affect so turn rate was the percentage we want it to go down we hypothesized it's going to go down by this much cool that's the before the after is did we do it or not very simple because you can have this whole hypothesis get to the end of the quarter get to the end of the week and then say we didn't really do it okay well then we didn't test the hypothesis now here's the fun one let's
(14:06) say you do it did what we expect to have happened happen because we are guessing that if we do this thing churn will go down but we could do the thing and children could remain the same and so it cost us time and it cost us money but the problem remained unsolved and this is the nature of business and this is why your second business grew way faster than your first business because you already knew the solutions to the problems that you're going to create along the way and then you run smack into problems that you don't know how to
(14:35) solve and this is why I'm I want to hit on this so hard you're not growing because there are problems that you need to solve that you're not solving because they're not fun and you don't know what to do so instead you're doing more of the thing that you know to do around opportunities but you still have not solve the problem and you've done this enough times that you've now grown the problems to the point where it's stifling your business and so you have to stop and so you have to look at that big to-do list that you have and you have to
(15:06) think which of these are problems that I need to solve that will make us better and as a result of being better grow our business and which of these are opportunities that are missed that we think that we could do but aren't doing yet I would encourage you to take that entire list of missed opportunities Theos and just move them somewhere else and what I have is something called Alex is Big money-making ideal list everybody in the company knows about this I have more ideas than we have capacity to implement and I have learned through
(15:39) many years of working with Lila that I actually only get maybe one out of 10 or 20 that I actually get to do because you don't have unlimited shots on goal that is the problem so Jeff Bezos has the saying that it's the beginning of this book I'll actually read it to you because I think it's so it's so significant outsized returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom and conventional wisdom is usually right given a 10% chance of 100 times payoff you should take that bet every time but you're still going to be wrong nine
(16:09) times out of 10 we all know that if you swing for the fences you're going to strike out a lot but you're also going to hit some home runs the difference between baseball and business however is that baseball has a truncated outcome distribution when you swing no matter how well you connect with the ball the most runs you can get is four in business every once in a while when you step up to the plate you can score a th000 runs this longtail distribution of returns is why it's important to be bold Big Winners pay for so many experiments
(16:35) now here's the one flaw and I Bezos is much smarter than me much richer than me but there's one flaw with the analogy if you go to a casino and you have a a a 100x payoff and you've got a one out of 10 BET then you should make that bet every time under one assumption that you can bet as many times as you please let's say you go to the casino and it's a $10 minimum bet and the bets 100x payoff but you only have 20 bucks you're only going to get two swings which means the likelihood that you fail entirely is four out of five
(17:11) you have a 20% chance of actually winning an 80% chance of losing period And so this is in my opinion a more realistic take of what it's like to be a business owner we do not have unlimited swings we do not have unlimited resources and so we have to be incredibly measured with which swings we choose to take and so the highest likelihood swings are the problems that need to be solved in your business today these are the sure money these are the as soon as you solve it you cash it in the things that are certainly not
(17:44) certain is the missed opportunities that are purely hypothetical and so if you solve all the problems that you have at a current level once you get to that and there are times where you get there where everything's kind of humming along that is when you look up your big missed opportunities list your big money-making idea list and you say now which of these will I take and here's the interesting thing if you do this you will find that many of the ideas that you were jazzed about two months ago now you think are
(18:14) stupid because you found out more from solving the problems that actually give you more information that this is actually not a missed opportunity and so it increases the likelihood that the swings you do take the big swings do result in the big payoff and so like this is like the big the ultimate sleep on it like if you have an amazing idea don't tell them right then because you're going to oversell everybody you're going to oversell yourself if you sleep on it the next day you're a little less psyched if you come
(18:40) back to it two months later you'll be amazed at how many of these things you just won't even want to do anymore and think about how stupid it would be if two months later after looking at all your ideas 90% of them you don't want to do anymore it means that every one of those things that you shov down your team's throat because you were excited about it was a mistake it was you failing as an entrepreneur because you got too distracted you got too excited about shiny object you got too into the stuff that you like rather than
(19:07) confronting the stuff that you hate that will absolutely grow your company this is something that I'm personally working on and I'm heated about it because this has been such an epiphany For Me In terms because I love any Frameworks that allow me to better prioritize that allow me to be a better strategic thinker for my business and so this operationalizes better what you guys can can expect from me is um I will be prioritizing making more content for you guys um I hope you guys have liked the deeper content stuff like the real
(19:37) business stuff I think right now I'll tell you honestly we settled on a 6 to1 ratio so basically five out of every six videos are going to be deep business stuff like if you guys haven't seen the last three videos that I put up on YouTube especially the one before last there's a banger case study on what we did to make 3 million bucks more profit in one of our folio companies to increase customer satisfaction course decrease refunds and chargebacks increase Ascension rates by over 40% just by fixing our onboarding
(20:09) process in this particular business and so every company needs some sort of onboarding process whether your physical products business you're a software company you're a you're a a service business you need to have that stuff but guess what that was a problem and it was a problem that we solved and it immediately made us more money and we should have put more attention on that even sooner because the reputation that we would have would be simply better right so like the early you create that amazing customer experience the more
(20:37) customers who go through it the more people have positive things to say about you and so I say all this to say one main thing confront your problems today forget about your opportunities for tomorrow put them on the big list once you've solved all the problems go revisit the list and then pick the one that has the highest likelihood of yielding the biggest return for you and then go all in on it if this content was valuable for you check out either of these two videos

(00:00) there's three ways you can get leads right one is you can manually assemble the leads list the second way is that you can buy leads from Brokers the third way is that you can scrape leads using software for me I usually will start [Music] with Zev what's up man how's it going good I have two questions um sort of both different topics but the first one is more lead related struggling to figure out which method is the best method to focus on so I don't feel like I'm wasting my time you know doing something
(00:31) um to try to get leads who are you going after the three main avatars would be like Tech startups B2B b2c SAS and then really any company that has like a custom uh software so there's three ways you can get leads right one is you can manually assemble the leads lists the second way is that you can buy leads from Brokers the third way is that you can scrape leads using software I usually will start with uh scraping if I can um because it tends to be the cheapest and so I'll use like if you just Google tool 4 whatever ever like
(01:02) what you're referring to yeah yeah and then I'll take the top four or five of them and I'll run my search for avatars into each of them and then I'll take a sample of like let's say 100 or 500 leads of each work all of them see which ones I get the highest response rate and then I'll double down on whatever platform got me the highest throughput you're saying which platform gets you the highest response rate that we were referring to which lead Source yeah I mean in terms of reaching out to the actual leads itself I reach out on
(01:26) everything that sort of ties into next thing so one thing I've been thinking about is you know how you talk about to lead with sort of with value offer something essentially for free so that's like a big thing where I'm just like not really sure how to even figure out what we could offer being that like am I like stepping is this like no you're good this is like I go through this literal step-by-step process in the book of everything that you're saying so it's like how to figure out what you're going to give the person for free how to structure it how to make like here's the script to get replies all that stuff um
(01:57) so the good news is the book will solve your problem but the best framework that I can use for coming up with things that people will reply to is give them Something Free that they would normally pay for so rather than be like I made this amazing thing but if it's the same free valuable thing that everyone else gives then how you know how good is it you have to compete by being significantly better but if you just do something that normally other people charge for even on a micro level and they can ascribe real value to that people will respond to you and then then you're operating on a you're you're in a
(02:25) way better frame and then you can have a much better conversation the other thing was more like on a personal side so we could just sort of step back when you were sort of going through that you know volatility of you had like success then big failures and come back up in terms of how you like structured your life if you did at all so that you P put yourself in the best position to where like you're cutting certain people out maybe you're bringing certain people or that might be even resources for skill development or whatever in how do you go about doing that so that you're not um
(02:57) doing things that don't really help you move forward and grow long-term big picture yeah so it's a it's a really good question because the number one way to change your behavior is to change your environment so if you change the conditions you'll behave differently right like if there's a red light you act differently than a green light and so that's a micro example of how we act like in Baltimore when I live there I act differently than when I move because I had I've had a clean slate like I didn't have to talk to old friends that would treat me a certain way that then I
(03:26) would respond to in the way that I didn't want to right and so first thing from a people perspective like I think a lot can be gained from literally just moving 30 minutes away like even if you like I can't move out of you know I'm not going to move from Baltimore to California okay that's fine just move to the other side of town just get just get out of the micro environment the second thing that'll then lead to is the people that you will frequent will change right and I think that you'll have to get
(03:51) accustom or be okay with the fact that you will lose a lot of friends and that's not a bad thing because the thing is is like if if all you have in common continues to shrink and shrink and shrink and the only thing you have left to talk about is the past remember the good old times remember that time we got so drunk at rippies you know what I mean like whatever then like they're not trying to help you create the future that you were ultimately looking for and it just like I will say that as I've gotten you know further along in that
(04:16) path my time to cutting people has just shrank because if I figure if I'm going to cut this person eventually I might as well cut them now and start enjoying the benefits of of not having them in my life and having all this back and it's like all those time if I have somebody who just keeps inviting me to and then making me feel guilty if I go out and they're like why aren't you drinking or like why aren't you like oh he's on another diet you know whatever it's just like you're not help like just asking
(04:38) the question like how do you think what you're saying is going to help me and if there's like well I'm just giving you a hard time it's like yeah understood how is that going to help me it's not okay so like either change your behavior or I will change it for you meaning I will just not have you in my life the third piece is that I remember there's this video I had just uh opened my six location and I was looking to open 7 through 10 and I had already mapped out where I was going to be opening them for my for my gyms and I remember I did this
(05:06) Facebook live and I was like beat up you know what I mean like I was tired I was taking I was doing 12 hours a day is a sale so I was taking sales sales from 8 to 8 every day and then I would still do the rest of my work before and after that and somehow trying to work out during that period I remember saying what are you willing to give up so I made this live it was like these are all the things I'm giving up now so like these are things that I used to do that I'm not going to be doing anymore so I was like I'm not folling the Ravens anymore so I was bore Ravens I was like
(05:31) I'm not I'm not watching football I'm not looking at Fantasy I'm not going to build a team I'm just on Sundays I need to work like I can't give the three hour I can't do it so I gave up football I gave up Netflix I was like that night time where like normally I like de you know decompressed I was like I don't have time for that right now like I got a process payments I got processed contracts I got filed with leads and do reminders for the next day and so it was changing where I was places wise being
(05:57) okay with the fact that I was going to have a period of a little bit more solitude because as soon as you cut things you create room you create a vacuum but new people will come in who are like in this world and I would recommend just connecting with people online because there's so many there's such bigger communities of people who are trying to do the same thing online versus wherever you're at locally right and then the third is it's just like what are my behaviors what are the things I'm going to give up in order like CU you got to make room like you
(06:21) only have 24 hours right so it's like what are the things that aren't getting me where I want to go and the thing is if you just say I'm not going to do those positive behaviors will fill the gap think for me it comes to more maybe a family side of things like those people I have a different way of dealing with them their family but like I don't know how to necessarily navigate that so two things first off I have very extreme views on this so like just take that with the great of Sal that that you will right if we Zoom all the way out like I didn't choose to be born that was forced
(06:51) on me and so like I don't feel like I owe anyone for that right now that being said I believe in Fair exchange or abundant exchange meaning like I'm going to make everybody in my life's life better for being there but I want them to also make my life better right and so I think the first layer of this is approaching it with absolute cander which is like what you would tell me being like man my dad you know he just treats me like I'm a kid he always brings up these things like when I was 14 years old and he keeps saying oh you
(07:17) know zev's got a short temper you know like my dad says that he's like you such a short temper right he used always tell me that and so you have to reset like you have to reset B like these are the rules of engagement like if you want me and in your life this is what is required from me which is like you cannot speak to me this way like if you know your your big Uncle grabs you by the neck and he's like look a little Nuggie you know whatever something like I'm not saying he's doing that but I'm saying as an extreme example like what would you do there you you're like No
(07:48) And it creates like it creates a moment where they're like oh now they'll then probably try and shake it up like dude I was just kidding it's like it wasn't funny I'd be like it's just you and me and I'm not laughing and it's like whoo that's a new tone right and so like you have to reset boundaries have to reset the Rules of Engagement and then the thing is is that you have to enforce those which means that at a certain point you have to decide that I'm going to decrease my communication Cadence I'm going to decrease my proximity to you I'm not going to be as I'm not going to
(08:17) be as accessible when you text me might take me a couple days to respond right when you say hey you got a minute I might not have a minute right like you have to earn that and like the fact that you are family gives you morally way but not infinite and so one of the unfortunate things about family is that we treat family worse than anyone else because we think that we can't lose them and so I reject that notion entirely I just I just don't I I believe in treating everyone the same family and stranger and then if I can benefit them
(08:48) awesome and if they can benefit me awesome and then we both keep Like Loving our relationship because we don't feel like we're owed anything and so that's that's bir directional though because that's the thing is if you're going to play this game in my opinion this is the way I play it which is that you're like listen I don't owe you stuff but it means I'm also not going to say you owe me anything and like we're starting there that's how I approach those things thanks for taking my questions appreciate it you bet s appreciate you good luck
(09:16) man hey Alex how is it going Selena what's going on how do you strike the balance between offering free value to pay offers like when is the perfect time to make that switch so you give until they ask simple as that you give and you keep giving and you keep giving and you keep giving until eventually people are like dude what else do you have can I get this from you like dude you've helped me so much like could is there and what happens is you'll start hearing what different people want from you and
(09:46) then you'll start noticing the common thread and then you can ask permission from your audience of the people that you are providing this value to and be like hey if I did something like this would you guys be interested and then take a take a poll very easy right and if they say lots of them say yes then it's like now you have permission from the audience to then say cool well I'm going to go spend 3 months building this for you and I'm going to get it to you guys just because you give things away
(10:10) for free does not mean that everything that you do is free we give free stuff in order to get more people interested and earn more trust so that on a longer time Rising we can convert more people into customers a purchase decision it's a prediction of future value right like I'm going to buy this thing cuz I believe that after I buy it I'm going to get in excess of whatever I paid for right and the best way to increase some increase someone's conviction that they're going to get value from you in the future is to provide it value to them in the present
(10:42) yeah and so that's the that's the whole game and so I'll give you I'll give you a different example so if I were to go up to 100 people and say hey uh buy my thing right I might get one person to buy it because I might have caught them on a good day and they're really struggling whatever right if I go to the same 100 people and say hey can I solve one of your problems for free more than one person will say yes maybe 20 people will say yes and then from those 20 people when you crush it for them and then say hey by the way I
(11:08) solved this first problem you now have another problem that's a better problem but it's still a problem and I can solve that for you too in exchange for money a way higher percentage of that 20 will now take you up on the offer and then you get half of those 20 to buy your thing and you go from one sale talking to 100 people to 10 sales so you can 10x your conversion rate by just adding a level of trust prior to the ask how do you come up with that idea and think about okay I'm going to give this for free and you have the idea you have the
(11:39) idea honestly like okay I'm going to I'm going to dive a little a level underneath is that you're not accustomed to the level of work that's required like real talk you're just not used to it and that's okay my level of output and my understanding of how much work capacity I have has continued to increase over time I have put 200 hours into the presentation that I'm going to be giving on Saturday yeah most most people don't put 200 hours into their product it's just it's just orders of magnitude in terms of difference and so like if people saw how much time I put
(12:08) into the things they wouldn't be surprised by the value yeah they'd be like well that makes sense he spent 200 hours on actually I'm a little embarrassed for the guy he spent he spent basically five weeks of work hours to make one you know 90-minute presentation and so I think that if you were to think about like for you to actually spend legitimately like working hours spend 200 hours on making something really good and that doesn't mean making it longer it means making it better and then give that away for free yeah and then what happens is if it
(12:38) really is good people will then share it with other people and then you get double effect you get more people to take you up on the free offer and then their friends send you other people there's so much more work that goes into it I spent six hours a day for two years on this next book I I work from 6:00 to noon every day and then I take my meetings I did that every day for 2 years and now I'm releasing the book right and I feel very confident that it's a good it's a very good product right and so again I think my level of work in terms of hours is probably greater than what you're doing and I have a lot of stuff going on right but you just have to be
(13:15) able to block the time and say the first four hours of my day every day for this month are making this thing and I'm going to make you exceptional and the thing is document you making it show people how much work you're putting into it and then when you do have it they're like like wow she really did this she didn't just whip up a PDF that took her a day I used to think that a day of like oh this took me a whole day a whole day in my mind was a long time and the nice thing is that the the really valuable
(13:42) fruit are right in front of everyone it just has a very tall ladder so you just have to climb a lot longer than other people will to go pick the fruit but it's right in front of you you just have to spend way more time making the thing exceptional which also means that all the other distractions that you're probably distracted on right now the little side projects this is me just guessing right now right you have to cut that because what you realize is the amount of work that's required to make something exceptional prudes you from doing multiple things yes like you can't
(14:11) do multiple things well you can do one thing exceptionally well and that means that you have to say no to everything else yeah how do you find that exceptional thing then it's not that you find it you make it the more you do the better you get and the more you pull the thread on any of the things that you're interested in the deeper you'll go on it because you will get better at it by very the very fact of how much volume you're putting into it so whatever it is that you help people with the one that
(14:35) makes you the most money right now ignore everything else ignore the other opportunities and say like how do I how do I make this even easier like think about the value equation how do I make it faster for them how do I make it less effort for them how do I increase their perception of the likelihood that they're going to succeed which means that you know what I've been offering one product but I really have three avatars and so I need to just make this tiny tweak here so that this person and this person and this person will be be
(14:59) successful now if I was going to lean in even more I would say just pick one of the three and then exclude the other ones just Master a puddle just be queen of a puddle and then you can be queen of a pond and then queen of a lake and then queen of a bay and then queen of an ocean right like but you got to start with the puddle cuz you're like half in half out between different ones figuring out what's my thing that I'm really really good at and like spend a lot of time on and perfecting that don't even think the thing that you're really good
(15:26) at cuz you might not be that good at anything right now and I'm not saying that as a I'm not that's not a WRA I'm just saying like that's not a dig I'm saying do the one that you forget about time while you're doing it and then you will become excellent because you'll be able to actually keep working like you have to solve for what is the thing that I can work the most like this amount of work is required to get where you want to go right to be exceptional and so then what you solve for is how can I find something that I don't mind doing this
(15:55) much work of but this much work is required no matter what and if you do this much work whether you're learning to be the best plumber or the best architect or the best whatever weight loss coach that like if you can do that and forget about time you'll win when I started on YouTube I told the guy that was editing my thing I said listen I'll do I'll do three videos a week for 10 years I was like and then if we'll measure whether it worked or not he's like I've literally never had anyone say that so
(16:19) like right now is just like you have you need a perspective shift thank you so much for the opportunity and thank you so much for the answer Joe what's up man how are you doing Alex nice to meet you nice to meet you too awesome uh my name's Joe I'm in the gym space I'm in the brick and Water Gym space the space you move I know some stuff about it I know some stuff about it and uh I'm one of those guys who uh read gym launch a couple years too late I'm a little older so I made all the same all the mistakes you talking uh talked about when I felt like when I read the book I felt like I was reading
(16:55) Deja Vu I was like oh my God all these things happen to me so my question to you is um me and my business partner Dan are launching a series of semi-private personal training Studios we're still in that space and we're launching one shortly and so using the hundred million leads book that's coming out and some of the stuff from JY launch and hundred million do offers what would you do to launch a gym our plan every six months for the next few years uh you know until we get a number that we're happy with and we keep getting fun my my preference
(17:29) my preferred model is one of two right now you're already doing one of them so I won't even get into the other one but I love the semi-private model um I love that like $300 $400 a month price point um two to three times a week um I like going after avatars that have a little bit more money specifically uh because for them you know they're not going to not pay during the holidays you know what I mean like for them they're not going to be like you know Breaking the Bank over 300 bucks um and the nice thing and I think this is this is I I got this from Rick rck uh Rick Mayo of alloy um that
(18:02) model allows you to get to about 5 600,000 a year with you know 1,200 s feet, 1400 ft like super small footprint um and a single manager who's got maybe 10 20% profit share maybe like 40 50k base and two helpers right so it's a very simple lean model uh one on six one on eight depending on how you want to do it um and you all you have to do is get to 120ish uh at the location and it's usually 50% margin I mean I I have over time simplified and simplified the model so that there's just so little operational complexity so that you can scale and because of are you familiar with dumb Bar's number yeah so the
(18:43) reason I like this model is that like most micro gims cap at 120 to 150 and it's because the systems required to purposely manufacture human connection become significantly more complex as you cross that barrier right and so rather than create this very very complex machine to make it run at 600 you know service based members I'd rather just have a model that runs very profitably at 120 to 150 members and so um lead gen perspective number one is that I would do a three-month uh pre-launch number two is that I would disproportionately spend on the launch so I would I would put like 30 grand um into the pre-sales
(19:26) and I would open at full capacity the best Jim franch rches know how to pre-sell so that they are in the Black in the first month and like every time I opened a new location like it was the first location was the one that I didn't learn I learned the lesson on my first one because I thought I was trying to get it open as fast as possible so I could make money but with everyone after that I tried to do pre-sales as long as possible so I could make all this money and not have to pay any expenses and so that way you can also Focus too cuz you can just sell for 3 months do nothing
(19:54) but work leads and and close contracts and then after that you I'm sure you're what's your turn right now for semis uh right now only about 5% okay I mean I I would shoot for three you know what I mean but five's okay um you know if you've got let's let's just say five right and you're you got 120 members it's six members a month you got to replace like it's just like it it's so easy to replace that um and just expect like if if you have and what's your price point monthly uh about 400 okay so 400 so that's an 8K LTV right in terms of Revenue you're not profit but like 8K LTV like you should be able to spend 500
(20:33) bucks to a Car customer and not even sweat on it and so like if you pay up to 100 bucks a lead local so that you can close 20% of those into contracts I'm not saying those are good numbers I'm saying those are exaggeratedly bad numbers you still be fine right because even if you had to close Six customers the month it's three grand a month in ads just to maintain it's nothing now in Jim want you talk about you know doing your six week transformation do you still recommend that as the primary giveway because that's best has been the
(21:02) rapper can change you know what I mean like I always call it's just wrapping paper on the present but like we're still doing nutrition we're still doing workouts so like whether I do you know 6 week 42 days 21 days 28 days you know belly fat blast meta metabog reset like you know slim by Halloween you know Lean by Halloween you know what it is slim for Santa you know big booty boot CIP free sixe challenge 42-day detox like a done them all like at the end of the day like all of those are rappers that you rotate locally just so that
(21:32) your ads don't fatigue but you want to always push it into the same sales process so that the Ops don't change so it's like the ad will change and then you get on the phone you're like hey what made you sign up for insert name of promotion they're going to be like well I'm kind of overweight and you're like great what have you done so far right and you start going through it so my second question is you know with a business partner who you know we have kind of like a different personalties we work really great together 17 years of a
(21:55) great partnership how do we how do you manage what would you recommend my my preferred mode is take risk scale fast like we we have momentum we're maxed out in both our other gyms we have a great local rep reputation and recognition and I'm like let's do you know let's do 10 of these in the next like three years and he's like loose his mind over it like he's more of a pro it guy in your experience you know what's better you know speed yeah or or or prove it you're both right a good partnership has a yes man and a and
(22:32) a no man right and so like in my Dynamic with Lila it's like I'm yes she's no right and that's basically how everything gets managed if it were up to me we joke like we would have a 100 businesses if we're up to her we'd have none he says no because he's knows how much work it is right like if you're the promoter and the you know CEO whatever you want to call it then there's usually more like strategic works or leadership stuff but in terms of like daytoday they usually bear the brunt of the work and so it costs more to them it's more
(23:01) painful and so I'll I'll give you my advice from what I would do having now worked with an implementer for a long time is I say what would you need to see for us to be for you to feel comfortable with us doing that and then she'll say here's the checklist if you do these things and you make sure these are the things that are that are done we can do the next one and then that way we have an agreement and it's like and to be clear if we do the same checklist at location three you feel good again like
(23:26) yeah I'm good again if we have these things and so and then you're and then you're aligned and then it's like cool let's just keep the party going that's perfect yeah that's great that's great advice thank you so much I'm really excited book and and and grateful for everything you've given out to the community of strength for sure appreciate it man thanks Joe Nicole what's up I don't know if you remember me we met at Eric Su yeah Mastermind so since then I started a podcast um doing pretty well I made most
(23:59) my money as a Creator doing brand deals so for example I was big in in the crypto space the second I started my podcast I had like a six-figure deal which coming to an end I don't think it's going to be renewed everyone that I everyone that I talk to is like Nicole you've grown on all these social Pages um not just my personal but like you know other brands that where I'm like curating other people's content and everyone's like it's a no brainer do a newsletter um i t i to sill Bloom for example you know who sells ads in his and that's his his model um but
(24:35) you know then I also heard you say recently that like subscribers and followers don't really mean anything like they're a vanity metric and you're like the game is now click retain reward what exactly does that look like because I like it's like currently I have nothing to sell you you're good you're good so it's it's it's two separate applications so from the grow perspective like growing the audience getting more people to see your stuff like that in that world subscribers I mean Tik Tok has changed the game in
(25:08) terms of how all the algorithms work right like right now if you have 10 million subscribers on YouTube if your next video sucks it's not going to get views period yeah it works same thing with Instagram you see people with 10 million per you know 10 million accounts make a post and it's got 300 likes on it right um it's because on the flip side though it's good for new creators because you can come on with zero followers make a banging video and get 10 million views right and I I actually think it's good thing for everyone because it equalizes the playing field it makes content King like the quality of what you put out which I'm always
(25:38) down to compete on that and so um so that's from the growth perspective from uh building out a newsletter like one is top of funnel the newsletter subscribers I mean that like those are customers you know what I mean and so I I'm in no way against having you know a new a newsletter of any sort that provides value especially to a nich audience cuz um a buddy of mine um has a ton of data on on subscriber stuff and like the ones that do the best in terms of LTV and whatnot are typically uh hyper Niche and high value so usually a little bit
(26:10) higher price point um but very specific to like the because they are so Niche they can provide an EXT like a lot of value to a person versus being like super wide it's very hard to provide tremendous value to everyone right it's kind of like Elon Musk thing of like you can either provide a little bit of value to a lot of people or a lot of value to a few people and so I think if you feel like you're better at a specific Niche I I think I think it makes sense for you to go top of funnel is just get really good at making content and then that
(26:38) just converts into your subscriber network uh so your newsletter and then you sell ads to the newsletter if you want to from an endorsement perspective you can also have your own products if you want to um but you just become a media business at that point which is fine I mean I'm I'm a big fan of media businesses okay that's really helpful the other question that I had your Dynamic is so different than what we we've seen in like traditional relationships yet it still works and you guys kill it so what what's that Dynamic like and how is it different and why do
(27:09) you feel like you guys Thrive we set out to solve a different problem with our relationship and so I think that the premise that most people come into the relationship with is different than how Lea and I approach the relationship and I think that's where I think fundament like you know like when you're solving a business problem I'm sure you probably asked this it's like what problem are we solving right it's like the first question you ask is like what problem are we solving and so most people don't
(27:32) even a ask that but B if they do ask that um they're usually trying to solve a different thing they're like I want to have lots of romance and this big Hollywood love which from everything that I know is something that is shortlived and then disappears and then you were left with someone that you were looking at and you're like well what do we have in common right and so Lea and I had both rode that that roller coaster multiple times before and we like and we both were at a point where we're like you know what and mind you I
(28:02) was very you know dejected at the time when I met her I was like listen I'm not trying to do anything I'm trying to build this this is what I'm doing and the first 30 dates we had were 30 days in a row where after our first date where we went to frozen yogurt the next date was not a date I was like I'm going to be working from 9:00 until I go to sleep so if you want to work with me you can and so that was what we did every single day is that I was like like I'm going to be working if you've got work we can work together and so it ended up
(28:32) just being somebody that I enjoyed a lot spending a lot of time with and the romance stuff honestly I feel like didn't really like kick in until like 2 and 1/2 years into our marriage and I think that our relationship was based on that like respect was first and then we learned the love part it's very hard to learn respect being hot or being physically attracted to somebody I feel like is the it's the ticket of Entry it's not like I see a lot of successful guys go find the the Instagram model I meet said Instagram model and I'm like how do you live like this like I would I would kill myself if I had to talk to
(29:06) this person every day right and they're like oh the secret is I don't talk to him I'm like that sounds horrible right and so again it's like they were solving a different problem and so for me my goal is always has always been number one like where I want to go right and having somebody who wants to go that way with you because I was engaged prior to Leila right wonderful girl um but we ultimately ended up deciding to cut it off because we simply had different goals for our lives she was like I want to do this and I was like I
(29:36) don't want to do that and it was like what are you going to do and we're like maybe you're a great person and I'm a great person we're just not necessarily like meant to be and that's okay because I think on some level like we say these things like non-negotiables but then we negotiate and so it's like either it's a non-negotiable or it is negotiable and for me it's like where I want to go is not negotiable so it's like I have these goals which is where I want to go my values which is how I want to get there
(30:00) and then lifestyle which what are my interests right and if I can find somebody who wants to go the same place the same way and have and likes doing the daytoday the same way as me then I'm good like the fact that Lela was into fitness was like great I go to the gym too you go to the gym like it's not going to be weird you're not going to be like oh I don't want to you know like she's in the same mindset of that right if I'm like hey I want to go invest in this Workshop or something she's not going to be like I can't believe we're
(30:23) spending $110,000 on this it's like that that person who would say that is not my partner and I think um in terms of me being the guy telling you what like the number one thing that attracted me about ilila was that Lea never tried to change me if you want to do big things then whoever is going to come along with you has to be equally big as a person and I think a lot of people settle for a $45,000 employee I mean and you can even it's if someone in the reverse if I were you and someone's like man I'm looking for a
(30:56) wife and I'd be like what are you looking for out of a wife like talk like not politically correct like what are you actually looking for and so then if they're like man I would love if someone cooked and clean and and fed me and and washed my clothes and iron and blah blah blah blah blah you're like okay question if I paid someone $45,000 a year to do that professionally then what would our relationship be cuz that that's an expense you know what I mean like we can just write the check and like all those things are solved so like now whaty Andy what's up man what is up Miss
(31:28) Mr Alex Hermos okay so question I have for you I've heard you talk a lot about investing in the S&P me instead of the S&P index like the Mi 500 right what would you say with those skill Acquisitions like which skills and in what order would you suggest maybe a person to go through because that kind of ties into your skill stacking is there a methodical way that you think yeah this naturally ascends to the next one I would think about it from the order of how you would actually make money so it's like well I have to have
(31:55) something to sell right so you have to have some sort of Base skill that you could sell if you're going to get into services or have some sort of based product right once you know how to do that so like if you're getting into e-commerce you have to build a store talk to manufacturers make the thing that you're going to sell step one on the services side it'd be like what's the key skill that I'm going to acquire to show people how to do it and you can acquire that skill by like working a job buying a certification going through a course going to a workshop like I learned I learned how to run Facebook
(32:22) ads at a workshop you know what I mean it cost me three grand um at the end of the workshop I know how to run Facebook ads and so and that $3,000 has made me many more than $3,000 over the rest of my career so point being first thing you start with the thing right the second thing you're going to do is that you have to focus on promotion so it's going to be advertising and if you think about this is the order I did the books right offers is what answers the question what do I sell and leads answers the question who do I sell it to right so like once
(32:49) you have the thing then you got to go sell the thing and let people know about it and you have to advertise and so that is that is that would be the second big skill stack the third one would would be conversion which is like kind of persuasion so sales and there's different ways you can do it so like you could learn how to build you know shopping pages in e-commerce that convert you could take phone sales you can learn how to to pitch and make vsls all of those things and then finally if you want to like learn the next piece would be leadership and operations because then you're going to have to hire people to help you out with the the
(33:16) caliber of people you work with and the different levels that they're at has there been anything that you would say maybe is the common one or two missing principles that most business owners are not doing or if it's maybe questions that they're not quite asking that you like sometimes if you're only to do like the one or two things not that they're not all important what are they yeah so I I just did a tweet the other day but like the difference between you know a thousand and a million uh is skills
(33:40) right the difference between a million and 100 million is character difference between 100 million and a billion in my opinion we'll see if it works is time uh and so once you have the base skills then it's really becomes about who the person is and so as you scale up the speed of scaling often correlates with the speed of talent recruitment because if you are a shitty person or a shitty boss or a bad leader or can't have cast division or can't explain why this is going to benefit a lot of people not
(34:08) just inside the business but also outside the business then you're not going to get the best people and if you don't have the best people you have to work overtime and then you never really able to pull yourself out of the business and so you can measure the qual you know the size and the scalability of the company by the talent that they can attract like there's a reason that Google and meta and Goldman Sachs and all of these ones pull from from all the Harvard you know all the IV League schools and all that stuff and you know we make fun of those people but they
(34:33) also make all of the money and so it's because they go they have a brand and they have a huge pipeline of uh training that they train people on and people also know that when they go to that brand Goldman Sach McKenzie whatever that they're going to be able to go and do whatever they want afterwards and so like what happens is you realize that there's a two-sided funnel right so on one side you have to learn how to attract customers but on the other side you have to learn how to attract talent because if you just only know how to track customers then everything always breaks and you can never get over the hump and you can never scale brilliant
(35:05) brilliant man well man thank you for reaching back and helping all of us go forward and taking the shortcut uh how would you approach creating strategies to generate leads and cultivate enduring customer relationships in this rapidly evolving Enterprise B2B landscape right when I say Enterprise let me clarify I'm speaking to Fortune 500 uh Global 2000 type organizations I'll tell you two very different things um on one hand I've got a buddy who sells only to Fortune 100 um and he was telling me that one of their most profitable strategies was hiring people from The
(35:44) Fortune 100 in the Departments that they're trying to get on board and then they hire them and they already have all the sway all the influence all the no all the knoow and then they can bring that account with them and then the major majority of their revenue actually just comes from cross- selling all the different uh markets that those people are in right so it's like okay I had to start with you know Google Southwest whatever right and then I have then I'm moving on to Google Mexico Google latam or whatever right um and so those are the two biggest areas of expansion from
(36:16) that perspective um in terms of the Legion like I don't think the legion really changes very much I think more or less it's just how quickly can I involve as many stakeholders as possible and make sure that my pitch is oriented to them looking good and them having no risk in terms of their job it's like here's my path to you getting promoted in a raise and here's there's no downside like it's all about them you know what I mean but I think I think part of it is like and I'm assuming you're a leader in the company um I
(36:46) think a lot of it is really getting the commission breath out of the sales guys um and oh this is like I'm getting into tactics but um is you know I love the term bam f right book a meeting from a meeting which is that we never have anyone falling through the cracks like we always know what we're doing to move the ball forward and I think some guys get tired or they I don't want to say lazy but like they get tired and they're like yeah I'm waiting for a response from that it's like well when are when are
(37:13) you meeting with them it's like well I'm waiting for the response it's like if you're not if you're not able to push the ball forward from one meeting to the next like that in my opinion is a loss like that's a that's like a missale even though maybe you could save it but you can dramatically decrease inrease the pipeline because even setting the frame with the Enterprise sale of listen normal Enterprise sales take 12 months 18 months 6 months depending on the thing that you're selling if you explain
(37:39) to the prospect you're like listen it actually doesn't take 12 months it takes 48 hours hours of work not time so if we have 48 1hour meetings to get this done we can just take that and we can stretch it over 2 years or we can do it in three 3 months it's really up to you and I think even just setting that breaks a little bit of the like this feels fast kind of language that a lot of like more corporate people will use and then making sure that the bean counters who are approving budget like hey I'm just
(38:11) being real um yeah that that that their asses are covered and that they can look good yeah for sure no it's all good feedback my friend so uh just quick follow-up question then I'll let you go regarding lead gen specific you know the companies we can compete against you're very familiar with MacKenzie exent right it seems like a lot of Le gen is based on content specifically gated content um and you know part of your value equation that I really like is you know value on the front end which is kind of difficult
(38:40) at the Enterprise level um any thoughts there moving forward is that do you see that you know kind of staying the same maintaining that I think that's 100% yeah I mean I think it's the same reason McKenzie for example puts out all those white papers and Goldman Sachs put all their industry analysis out right and you opt in you get it and then they'll follow up with you and I think I mean I mean in my opinion this may be an oversimplification but I'm a simple guy like I'll I'll get the name from anywhere in the org that that downloads
(39:06) the thing that's valuable for them and then that's where the scripting comes in of the Judo of like hey you got this thing what are you getting this thing for well we're working on this initiative whatever it's like well like what's you know you get into s like you get into sales like what's the objective what are you guys trying to do cool who else is involved and then you start then you start moving your away through the YG so I want to pull the thread from wherever I can or sorry get the thread and then just start pulling my way no
(39:29) that's that's great stuff man I really appreciate it uh looking forward to the new release on Saturday man thanks brother I appreciate your time

(00:00) if you want to use organic marketing to get more leads for your business or you're starting from scratch whether it's a new department or brand new for your business I talked to a room full business owners for eight hours and this is one of the best moments that we pulled out of just talking about organic strategy to help them make more money there these two worlds where there's like the world that makes money and just needs traffic and the world that has so much traffic and has no money and so when you learn how to marry those two
(00:23) you just make absolutely obscene amounts of money um I mean like Logan Paul merging with Prime like he had the audience in the traffic and then he had a way to make money Mr Beast with the chocolate like he had he had distribution he just needed a product Alex rosi needed a product for the distribution base school right tons of traffic where do we send it right now if you have paid ads starting organic will immediately make the paid ads more profitable because what will happen is people will look at the ads then they
(00:52) will look at your organic and then they will take the next step even if they took the next step and booked a call they will actually show and if they show they'll have a higher percentage of closing like don't worry about the views and all of that stuff that happens in the early days just keep making it and just think about in the beginning as lead nurture in the early days it'll be nurture as you get bigger and bigger it'll become acquisition but just from a value perspective if you can just make that shift it'll make your life a lot
(01:15) easier from a scaling organic perspective I I tend to always start with an agency uh for every new medium or platform that I want to go on now if you don't want to do that that's fine I just prefer to buy lessons and Shrink my timelines and so I started with a guy that I think I was paying like five grand a month in no way was he special basically did nothing um but it kept me accountable to making three videos a week and so I would do that and he would post them I still don't really know how to post a video on YouTube um so I say
(01:47) that because uh if you just focus on making the content exceptional like it will grow like it absolutely will grow and just my recommendation is do not promote in the content to the greatest ever so think about it like this is that you want to have this big valuable thing all this content that you're teaching the ctas in my opinion in content are not very effective like they kill reach it feels weird no one likes it whatever people will naturally just take the next step if you put it in the descriptions you put it in your link your link in BIO
(02:21) like you do those two things you will get traffic to your stuff by just saying this is what I do rather than hey by the way like I just I don't think that's the right way to do it the beautiful merger of these who here knows how to run ads just like get a show of hands okay so like half of you guys okay where the magic happens is where you build all the Goodwill for free and then you use ads to do the ctas and so has anyone here read the leads book okay so there's the whole content section about the give ask
(02:54) ratio the unfortunately based on the book and the limitations of the book I can't get into like more advanced stuff where it gets really juicy is that all of your content is only give and then the ads are the ask so then you don't have to balance a give to ask ratio you just only give in content and then the ads serve to be the CTA and for whatever reason it protects the brand it's a totally different vibe if I was if I was like right hooking every video be like hey go to here go to here go to here people would
(03:25) be like whoop and then that that would be it like no one would watch my stuff anymore but if I keep providing value they get value I deposit Goodwill and then later we can hit them with an advertisement to go do something and they exist completely separately and so we just want to think about the Mind space of like the 3 to1 ratio still exists if you think about someone's news feed so they have like content one from you content two from you content three from you and then they have an ad from you and so here's the money one and all
(03:52) this other stuff is free and so think about it from a larger perspective and that's this is this is where like this is where the obscene money is what do you guys have questions about here all right so I'm going to just ran at you for a second and try and cross as many of these out as I can so from a like topics volume like these kind of all go together so so Evelyn for you if you're looking at I make this really Niche content I need to go wide in my experience like keep making the content that's going to serve your avatar if you
(04:23) want to have I would say like if you want to sprinkle in I just consider it further top of funnel and so like we have made some of these like I made one video on some meal stuff I did um and I would say that for us we kind of swing a little bit like a pendulum where I I only like making business content the team will urge me to not make business specific content so that we can appeal to a wider audience from time to time and usually like the more I do this I'm like ah I and then I swing back over here and I'm willing to know that the
(04:52) volume drops and I'll just tell you let me just share this experience with you so we did um we did a workshop here that's why it's set up like this and I asked the room I said hey uh of the content that I make which you guys are consuming like the case study stuff where we like build out a sales team and like like how we do onboarding and like all that stuff and here is consuming like lessons to my younger self the whole room was this side and so even though these got onethird the views of these ones sometimes this can
(05:21) introduce people like the right people will then just think about as top of funnel like this gets more people in they'll see other stuff you have and then they'll go down the longer more Niche videos that's specific to them now the other people who just come for that well they'll wait till you have your next one of that and then YouTube or whatever will display it to them um so that's from a topic perspective I would say if you do like four like 3 to one four to one in terms of your Longs like one I go a little bit wider and the rest
(05:47) I still stay on topic you'll probably get the best of both worlds what I would tell you though is that I think your stuff's really good and I I think you just need to get you need to learn more presentation skills and that's okay that's not like this is me trying to help um and so I think that you could probably take the same content you're currently making and just simply structure it better and you'd probably get 10 times the views a side note for you guys is you'll notice the bigger the Creator usually the less frequent they
(06:17) actually make videos and it's because they realize just power laws exist which is that if you spend 10 times more time on one video it doesn't get 10 times the views sometimes it get a 100 times the views and so qu especially platforms nowadays are so heavily ring on quality you create the quantity to figure out the quality and so in the beginning more people make lots of content and then you start figuring out the stuff that works figuring out the stuff that works and then you'll notice that they're like oh man well we did
(06:47) spend more time on that video okay well if we're going to keep making videos like that I don't think we can make this money but it's okay because you make it up on the fact that the total quality of that one it gets shared more people watch it longer and um I think Mr B said this but it was like if you make 10 videos or you spend 10 times and you make that one video 20% better in terms of ABD or click-through rate you don't get 10 times the views you get a 100 times the views so you get a disproportionate return for quality and
(07:15) so I think it's fine from a from the niche content perspective but I would go really deep on the topic and try and keep it keep it as um congruent with the packaging of the video which is where a lot of people lose off and you need to obsess about your first 30 seconds but like this last uh weekend I watched my top 35 YouTube videos I watched the first three minutes of all of them and I wanted to figure out like what was it that I did in these videos that I didn't do in other videos that had similar average view duration but I didn't like
(07:45) I I I didn't I didn't carry as many people through and um I'll just share this with you the three PS that I found at least for us which is promise proof path and so you want to cover that and this is where this is for you in terms of the big difference between Ed Educators and entertainers they don't think that way and maybe I'll find out in two years I'm wrong here but this is what I think right now which is that like there's a huge there was a huge Obsession of like match the exact words of the headline with the first however
(08:17) many seconds of the video confirm the thumbnail in the in the background and that's really B Because if you say hey we're going to crush a Lamborghini and you they go and it's a talking head there's no Lamborghini they're like screw this and they're out right but if you're educating then I think the Lamborghini in our situation is proof is how what is the big Vegas lights of why should I listen to you sure I want to learn more about guarantees okay but why should I listen to you and if you can answer that as quickly as possible like the the videos
(08:49) that like when I looked at my top ones it was just like hey I sold my company for $ 46.2 million a big part of that was that we had a guarantee that beat all of our competitors and so we did four things that we used that that made our guarantee stronger done and if it if that's what I said the video is about they're like okay there's a promise of what he's going to help me do there's a path and I have proof of why I should listen to this guy and so you want to have that like what's in it for me and why should
(09:15) I believe you and then the the path in my opinion is just to show that there is structure and you can set expectations and then meet the expectations I think that's more about watch time uh the first two are about why should I stay and then the that's the what's going to happen I will probably write a book on branding at some point I think I have significantly increased my understanding what like what a brand is and so I think first starting with the term of defining it which is it's an association between two things like that's what a brand is
(09:42) it's between things that people know it's people that they don't know and so branding is also a word for teaching like if I say if I I wear a hat in every video then people start to associate the hat with me right and if I provide value eventually you can take the hat off and people still associate the value with the hat fundamentally that's what branding is and so if you're trying to make content about a certain topic they will associate you with that topic and so if you want to be known for a certain thing like that like the background
(10:14) everything that goes into it people make associations that's how we learn right and so there are three elements to Brand the first is the strength of the influence when people see me or see a logo or see something does it change their behavior and and so if we were to go to the atmology of the word basically where it first began branding was like if I branded a cow right you brand a cow it's got It's got a mark on it the reason for that was because it would change people's behavior if I saw a cow that didn't have a brand a cow that did
(10:41) have a brand I would maybe catch this cow I would leave it alone i' do whatever but the one that has Rick's logo on it I might give it back to Rick or i' kill Rick if I or kill the cow I hate Rick or i' steal the cow either way the brand I would treat this cow differently than the cow that had no brand and so Brands change Behavior at scale that's why they're so valuable and so the question is from an influence is what percentage of people does it change their behavior if it changes a lot of people's behavior Donald Trump changes a
(11:09) lot of people's behavior now the next question is is that behavior going towards or is it going away for some people it's very strongly towards and other people it's very strongly away but he changes people's behavior so he has strong he has a strong brand from an influence perspective the directionality is going to depend on the person and then the next piece the third piece is just the reach which is how many people in general have this association with you and so if you're thinking I want to build a brand then you think about the
(11:35) hypothetical Max of what a brand would be which is you'd want as many people as humanly possible moving towards you and all changing their behavior at once when they see your thing that would be the hypothetical Max of a brand right like Taylor Swift has a brand that's very close to this everyone knows who she is she has a very strong brand in terms of changing people's behavior and they tend to move in the direction that she wants them to go so I also kind relatively reject the concept of all all publicity is good publicity I
(12:05) would just say all publicity is publicity it will increase the reach of your brand it won't increase necessarily these two but it will increase the reach more people will know about you and so it's just being specific about what a brand actually is and so if you understand that a brand is built through associations then you're also very careful about who you choose to be uh who you choose to appear next to right and so there's a reason that um I don't speak on stages anymore that I don't own mostly because the audience will
(12:34) associate me with the other speakers and I often don't want to be associated with the other speakers um podcasts even to a certain degree have the same thing they spend an hour with me and this other person and I've become more and more strict about this to the point where I really don't appear like I'm not really trying to appear with anyone anymore you are always going to be the purest version of your brand like you are your brand and so you leaning into to more of you is the stuff that's going to accomplish these things and if some
(13:03) people are turned away from you that's fine but what we can do to change that is we try and reach as many people as we can and we try and provide value to those people so that they change their behavior and ideally go towards us I just wanted to draw that out for you guys CU I thought hopefully that was helpful Niche versus white algorithm uh big picture here don't worry about it like always just align your objective with the platform like hacks are stupid because if you grow off of a hack like hashtags work or whatever as soon as
(13:35) they close the loop because all platforms do you'll just go down to zero it's not a long-term strategy so just why do it in the short term if it's not going to work long term the long-term strategy of every platform is to keep people on the platform and so they want you to make content that lots of people click on and that lots of people watch all the way through and ideally watch something else from you so everything that they do in the algorithm is just to always optimize for those three things and that's not going to change now the
(13:59) math that they do to code it might change but the objective will always be the same and so if you aligned your objective with the algorithm's objective you will never have an issue and that goes for shorts it goes for Longs like that's why the Hook is so important because they want to they will see that a lot more people are making past the first 3 seconds so we will show to more people and if a lot of people watching all the way through they'll show to even more people and that's all it is because we're aligning our
(14:22) objective with theirs that's it okay shorts versus Longs um in the beginning think about a long as just many shorts put together just from like if we have that path that I was talking about like think about your path as the seven shorts that you're going to string together you just don't have necessarily 60 seconds that you have to get it you can get to 90 seconds whatever but you still structure them the same way and that will be beneficial for you but in terms of Longs there's only three formats you've got lists
(14:54) steps and stories and you can intermix all three of them so you can have a list of things and have steps within the list and then tell stories about each step but all three can be intermix because that's fundamentally like what content is is it's lists steps and stories volume max so from a volume perspective we put out if you want to like blow blow your mind uh we put out 350 pieces a week so put 50 pieces out a day um across all platforms I would start with something that you can commit to and then basically you just keep ramping up and
(15:29) the big the big Flex on this is understanding where you get double triple qule quintuple dips um on content and so a lot of people don't know this but the highest leverage thing that I do with my time is I make tweets those tweets are actually the like the life source of everything so my tweets which I think you have to have a couple ways that you want to capture like you everyone captures content differently but for me if I get an idea I can tweet it in two seconds it's not it's not it's not hard for me to do that and so by doing that I
(16:00) Capture Moments throughout the day and then when we do record with the team they'll pull up my tweets and be like what was this about and then I have content on that and then when they're like what do we Capt in this Instagram they take my tweet and so I get and then the tweets themselves become reals and I can also say the Tweet out loud and make it a video and so all of these things all stem from one place and when I had gym launch before I was public this actually was an old habit of mine cuz I actually had this big email thread to
(16:26) myself which was like lessons and failures throughout the year and every year I kept one email thread that whenever I'd learned something I would just send it to that that thread so I'd keep it and I just replac that with Twitter and I just now word them slightly better um but I think you need to have a repository for where your ideas are going to go as they come up throughout the week if you don't know topics that you can go on look at your calendar look at every single meeting you had that week and what you spent your time on and
(16:55) that will give you more than enough content to talk oh yeah I had this meeting and had this uh one of my clients had this issue with her order bump and it wasn't working and so this is what we did right great content but like if unless you look retroactively you might not think about it when you're on the spot and so one is that I always I document in real time through tweets or emails do whatever you want you can have notes on your phone two is I look at my calendar of like what what did I do this last week that
(17:19) was interesting or like that I learned or something that came up from a meeting perspective the third category is far past so like what are the what are the big lessons that have that changed or shifted my beliefs that are valuable to somebody else and so you've got far past you've got recent pass which is your calendar you've got real time which you do your Tweet dumps on and then um the kind of like fourth category you can look at is what I call manufactured which is like I lived on $100 for a month which is much closer to
(17:44) entertainment I don't really do much of that but it is another bucket of like topics of content I started a school Community from scratch and this is what I did like that would be manufactured right and so that's how I think about it from a topical perspective that keeps it both interesting and endless um that like we never have a lack of content like we always have stuff how do you get those Frameworks out of yourself because I think that's one thing that sets you really hard is that you framework everything do you
(18:11) have a method turn now yeah um I actually have an answer to this now I've gotten that question a zillion times but I do have an answer now so like the framework for making Frameworks is that if even if I'll just use the micro story I had about promise path plan right if I have to do something repeatedly and I have to do it over and over again I want to create some sort of templates I don't have to remake the same decisions or have to resolve the same problems and so I tend to then drink in a ton of data so I watched 35 of my YouTube videos the
(18:37) intros and then I was like okay what are what are all the things that happened in each one of them so I wrote them all down and then I was like okay well this one had five things this one had seven things this one had two things okay well what did they all have in common well they all had these three things and so then you narrow it down to what are the few fact basically delete everything and if we only had these are the three things that they all had and so this was the same thing when we had um gym launch
(19:00) I didn't know how to retain customers I was really good at selling them but the gym members like I had industry average turn and what we did to solve that problem was that I uh got my customer base I said who here has less than 3% monthly churn for six or eight months and so there 20 gyms that had that out of however many thousand and so I got them on a call and I said okay tell me every single thing you do to retain customers and each one of them had 20 plus things that they were doing but when I interviewed all of them all of
(19:28) all 20 of them were only doing five things in common and those became the five Horsemen retention which is became the framework for how we retain customers in a gym and so you drink in a ton of data you get everything and then you Circle where are the commonalities and then if I want to make it sexy I try and have them be the same letter promise path plan easy to remember or make it an acronym something like that but that's fun like that's the real process and then the the the naming thing is the is super easy so that's that's how we make
(19:56) Frame Works go ahead what's your take on controversy for content and brand so I'll say this and this should hopefully put a lot of you guys at ease I actually don't think you can be canceled I just don't think it's true you can only be canceled if a platform if all means of communication that you can communicate with an audience are removed from you like you are unable to communicate and you stop making content R Kelly has been canceled because he also stopped making content now he did I'm trying to think of like the most
(20:25) hypothetical extreme of terrible scenario right I would bet I mean you look at con right he can say anti-semitic stiff whatever he continues to make content and people still continue to follow him like you become uncan as long as you don't accept that you can be canceled and I think fundamentally that's it now from a controversy perspective on that the sheet that I had over earlier about reach controversy helps you get reach the other two maybe maybe not and so thinking about like what like it's basically the same as
(20:56) getting on a trending topic like to me controversy and Trends are the more or less the same thing um like more people on average will be interested or at least click it drives CTR but what do I want them to like I would not want to associate with a lot of different controversies so I don't talk about them I personally don't talk about that stuff it's just I don't I don't care enough but yeah some people do I don't you have a good feel on organic in terms of making content where the topics come from algorithm stuff shorts versus longs
(21:29) find one person to hire 10 people who's really smart overpay them volume comes from commit to what you can and then slowly ramp up the volume is really so that you learn the quality more than anything else and then product Market fit the customers that you have are going to come from the the the niche content even if it doesn't get many views Sor one question sure agency or Star did hires people I I did both um so I mean I first started with the agency and then I was like okay now we're we're really serious basically when I sold gym launch I was
(21:59) like okay now I can really do this when I had gym launch and I was just starting some of the YouTube videos and uh podcast I had a podcast agency that just posted it and I had a YouTube agency that posted it and then when we were like okay we're really doing this I brought Caleb in he then started managing the agencies and then he hired people in house to replace them and basically I literally outlined the step in the book on agencies but there's going to be a period where they work and your team works so you pay twice and
(22:29) until your team beats their team and I tell them I'm like I'm going to beat you that's all I'm trying to do here and as soon as our team beats their team they go away how do you actually find like a good agency or a good the creative director talk to 10 listen to all of them you'll quickly see who has their together and who doesn't you can also bid them against each other if you really want to but I rarely do that I usually just quickly see who's good and who isn't and I try to go offer referrals of people cuz good
(23:00) like I'll say this the best agencies don't need to run ads like they have more customers than they can handle food nom nom

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video i'm going to walk you through the best way in my opinion to pick the niche that you're going to focus on to start your business so i asked my instagram you know what are some of the questions that you have and uh this one came up a lot which is like how do i pick my customer how do i pick the niche like what's the process etc and so obviously my book this guy it's 99 cents on amazon for those of you guys who don't know are like ah it's not 99 cents the kindle is 99 cents because it's digital the hard copy amazon
(00:24) changes the prices but you can get a hardback or you can get the digital one for 99 since because that's the lowest they would let me sell it for all right anywho so picking the niche i think this is something that's like wildly misunderstood and i'll tell you where most people get wrong is that they pick a niche and they have no idea about the niche all right and so y combinator which is a venture it's like an incubator type thing in silicon valley they have their things that they look for when they're investing
(00:48) businesses and they're accepting them into yc and one of the ones that was really interesting to me is that they look for past experience within the space and because i think a big part of that is that a lot of times new businesses are not actually really new they're slight iterations on things that are old and candidly within my own business experience i don't even do anything new i just try and do stuff better which people somehow poo poo on it's like you go into dry cleaning and do it better than everybody else and
(01:13) still win like you could go into lawn care and do it better than everyone else and still win and i think that's wildly underrated you don't need anything new and so like i think that is a widely underestimated component of having strategy and business is just like how do how am i get the use the value equation in the book like i'm going to provide more value to my customers than anyone else can but like the actual industry itself that you're serving doesn't need to be new or different right so that being said like service
(01:34) with a smile wildly underrated but the the piece that i want to hit on here is that like i'll tell you this story because i think it really drives this point home so in allen our software company that we recently sold a majority stake in one of the agency owners you know for nine months was just like never making progress right like was always hopping on was always having issues and it was like his clients weren't getting results he was like how do i get around that and i was like you don't you need to fix that and um it got to the point
(01:56) where i just said listen man like you don't know what you're doing which is why your clients are getting results period he said well i've got this one guy who does who makes all this money using our you know using the leads that we get him and i was like okay well why is he getting making money the other ones aren't he's like well i don't know and i was like right so that's not because of you that's because of him and so what i told him to do which was wild at the time i said i need you i think that you should close your agency i was
(02:20) like i don't think you know anything about real estate i said i think that if you know how to get real estate leads then you should go get your realtor's license go generate your own leads and go build a real estate business and learn it and then once you have succeeded in doing that then if you want to then go make the agency and show other people how to do it because you've actually done it and so there's a tweet by layla my wife she said like stop listening to people about like sorry stop listening people about how to play
(02:45) the game who've never been anywhere but the sidelines and the problem is too many of the people who are watching this right now y'all are on the sidelines and have always been on the sidelines and are trying to pick a niche to get into to sell how to do the niche well that's dumb you've never done it so a lot of times people are trying to skip to a higher leverage opportunity without having done the requisite work of understanding the niche which is why the y combinator people look for like if you want to make a software in the payment
(03:09) space we'd love to see that you have experience in the payment space because there's so much stuff that you don't know that you know when you actually spend three five you know years doing something in an industry you understand the lingo you understand the avatar you understand the problems and you can see opportunities if you have an entrepreneurial hat on there's always problems in every industry which means there's always opportunity and fundamentally business is just solving problems that exist with a and making
(03:31) sure the math makes sense like that's literally it it's like where is their problem how much do they think this is a problem and is there a way that i can solve it and charge for it that's it like that's really all that business is and really how well you solve the problem is going to dictate how much virality your business has because if you solve it really well people will tell people and your your business will grow right i think the problem that a lot of people have is they didn't know how to make an offer right is the
(03:52) fundamental thing that is the beginning of building a businesses you got to know what you're selling and so that was a problem for a lot of people and then people got that problem solved and then they told their friends and books sold 100 000 copies in six months with no promotion and so i'm only i'm sharing this because i couldn't write a book on offers without having made a ton of offers and i feel like there's too often people who are trying to focus on a niche who've never actually done the thing in the niche and this is really
(04:13) really rampant in the internet space because everyone's trying to take a shortcut to get there when they realize like what i'm telling you right now you're never going to get there because you're not good enough like you're never going to get there because you're not good enough you have to do the rocky cutscene you have to eat the [ __ ] for a period of time so that you can get the reps in so you can put your time under the bar end so that you can actually get good and before you are good you will suck and you have to accept a long
(04:33) period of sucking and you do enough volume that eventually you'll suck so little that you'll actually be good and then at that point then you'll actually have a real decision to make which is i'm actually really good at this thing now that i've learned do i want to teach it to other people or i just want to do more of the thing that i'm doing right because like a realtor can then just grow a team of 100 realtors and own the entire thing which is what i'd recommend this guy do right rather than have an agency um that doesn't right and so this
(04:55) is kind of where where i think the problem is is that like i had another question that was sent to me on instagram which is like hey how do i soft churn because a lot of my a lot of my clients aren't getting results and i'm like well duh he's like no he said he said how do i sell from 10 000 100 000 a month when i don't have a lot of testimonials i was like you're not good at the thing that you're supposed to be good at why you don't have testimonials is why you're not going 100 000 a month like he's making the goal 100 000 a month rather than
(05:19) being good i i i have no words i have no words i don't get it you know what i mean like everyone's in such a [ __ ] rush that you will never get there it is the slowest path to getting there is to fool yourself into thinking that you're good something that you're not you have to go and pull the thread and say which and the thing is it's like well do what you're passionate about whatever you're not gonna be passionate about stuff that you suck at what you have to do is like which of these opportunities seem like
(05:44) they have potentially have high leverage and i'm gonna learn from the bottom right it's like one of the best ways to learn stuff is starting at the bottom not because because it's the only option but because if you understand the entire pathway of of a client journey or of an industry journey then you will have more trench knowledge more depth of experience that you will be then able to apply people see my you know videos on personal finance people see videos of mine on sales people's videos online recruiting people see videos of mine of
(06:09) marketing and it's like how did you acquire all these skills it's cause like it's not like because i tried to jump to the spot that i'm at you can't skip like there's a sequence buildings are built with foundations and your career is a pyramid and the peak of that pyramid is based on the depth of the foundation that you build and so like i've said this before and i'll say it again but your work works on you more than you work on it and so even though you might not be getting paid in the period that you're at just because you're struggling
(06:32) doesn't mean you're failing and it means and the thing is as long as you're getting better you're making progress and the progress is the success is that you are getting better and like you will turn the corner like that's an inevitability if you put enough time in period i promise you that if you don't stop doing something for 10 years you'll be really good at it period and if you're really good at it you'll like doing it ah right and if you like doing it then at that point you won't wonder why your business isn't making money
(06:53) because you'll actually be good and then you won't have these questions but the questions that i get i would say a third of them come from a very short time horizon it's like why am i not a millionaire it's been it's been 90 days alex what the hell it's like well you didn't put the five years in so if you're trying to figure out what niche you're gonna pick the point is to just pick and then accept that you're not gonna be overwhelmingly successful for like five years every entrepreneur like that i know of puts five years in before
(07:16) before anything really happens and you're like [ __ ] five years i probably shouldn't tell new entrepreneurs that yes you're gonna be very successful very quickly you should quit your job and do it it takes a long time to learn because there's a lot of stuff you gotta know gotta know how to generate leads you got to know how to work leads you know got to know how to set appointments you got to learn how to close you got to learn how to set up bank accounts you got to learn how to transact you got to learn how to do billing you got to learn how
(07:37) to do payroll you got to like you got to learn how to actually fulfill a product you allowed to learn how to create a customer journey got to learn how to ascend people you got to learn how to decrease churn you got to like there's a lot of stuff you got to learn how to recruit you got to learn how to hire you got to like there's a lot of stuff that you got to learn and so to think that it's somehow going to take 90 days it's like why do you think that you can get a chemistry degree in four years and think you can somehow be able to become a
(07:57) masters in entrepreneurship in 90 days it doesn't it doesn't give respect to the game like you have to respect the game like a lot of people have been playing this for 40 years no one's getting their master's degree for 40 years well some phds aren't right and they're probably pretty good at whatever their thing is right and so it's like to think that you're going to beat guys who've been playing the same game for 40 years on your first try in 90 days doesn't respect the game and so like i was fortunate that i started young i
(08:19) started when i was 23. i mean the only thing i could have done before that dude without doing that is just start instead of going to college but you have to you have to put your time under the bar your legs aren't going to grow until you have like you can't do four squat workouts and expect your legs to grow you'll get better at squatting and that getting better at squatting is a requisite for having bigger legs but you still got to put the volume in there's a depth of understanding that happens with volume
(08:39) that people cannot appreciate you gotta do the boring work and you gotta love the boring work and if you can do that you won't lose because the only person who's injecting this artificial timeline on on you is you and so anyways it was like one of the number one questions that i was getting in my comments and stuff it's like how do you pick the niche how do you know where to start you don't know where to start you just start and then you start accumulating knowledge and then you will learn it's like reading books on sales before
(09:01) you've actually had a sales call i'm actually very against it i think you should start selling and then read books on sales because then the books will actually make sense to you right like trying to read 100 books on entrepreneurship before you've actually had a business is silly start a business how do you start a business you get a bank account get an llc and you figure out what you're going to sell like that's what that's what you do that's how you start a business so it's going to start with promotion and selling
(09:22) because you can't even have the rest of the stuff until you learn how to do that and if you don't know what you're selling it's because you probably won't get the thing yet so you got to go like get some industry experience right that's why banks by the way they don't loan to people who don't have industry experience so if you're like hey i want to get a you know loan to this was actually a story i heard from from my gym owner ended up working with us for a period of time was in gym launch was he wanted to start a gym and and get a loan
(09:43) from the bank and they he went to like 10 banks and they all said no and they said and he said the reason was because he didn't have experience so what he did was he went to uh bally's and worked at bally's for like three or four years and worked his way up to becoming the personal training manager and then at that point started his gym and he didn't even need the bank loan at that point because he had saved some money and he learned how the business worked and lo and behold he was like that was some of the best advice i ever had so sometimes
(10:06) you just got to get the industry experience people just want to skip to the last step when like there are prerequisites to getting there which is why prerequisites exist so this is uh hopefully the the real answer to how to pick your niche which is like you just need to do something that is at least not you know repelled from that you see people making money in and then stick with it for an inordinate amount of time without convincing yourself that you're smarter than you are which is a loose paraphrasing of a twitter quote that i
(10:31) can't remember who wrote it so anyways if you're new i don't know if i said in the beginning but my name is austin mosey own acquisition.com about 85 million a year and if this is your first video welcome to mozi nation and i'll see you next vid bye

Transcript:
(00:00) two out of three businesses fail and so that means within 10 years if we were to look back at these business owners two out of three are out of the game every business that I've started since 2016 still continues to make money to this day so here's how to make your business Unstoppable there's three steps it starts with stop selling small customers your business May Fail not because you are a failure but maybe because the customers you serve are failures let me tell you a story to explain this so there was a small M CRM back in the day
(00:31) that approached me about investing I asked them what their turn was so what percentage of customers were leaving between last month and this month and their answer surprised me it was a much higher percentage than I expected because I thought a CRM they're processing their payments through here they have all their memberships in there like this should be a very sticky product and I said so where is the churn coming from and they said oh well about a third of the gyms go out of business every year and I was like Wow wait a second so this has nothing to do with
(00:57) how good your product or service was these businesses in and of themselves just stopped being in business the formal language for that is called structural turn it means it's like it's based it's baked into the structure of the market that you serve now the question is is that your choice to pursue that market and the answer is yes a lot of business owners struggle in the business and they look at everything except for the most important thing which is they they messed up the pick Chick-fil-A's head of people gives a great example of this when they talk about actually Talent selection but I think the parallel holds they said most
(01:29) people lose in the NBA in the Championships and wonder what they did wrong in the game when in reality they lost in the draft as and they didn't have the right people on the team and so if you think about your business as an ecosystem the right people in the team has to be all the stakeholders including the customers and so if you're thinking about your own business there are many business models that simply aren't fit for smaller customers and so I'll give you a different example in the agency world where you do some sort of advertising for any type of business if you look at some of the biggest ad agencies in the world you'll notice a
(02:00) common theme they all serve the biggest customers in the world whereas if it were true that agencies would be best served serving small customers then some of the biggest agencies would serve some of the smallest customers but that's not reality in looking at this it means that just like the CRM business and that's arguably one of the stickiest businesses you could possibly imagine the agencies could not keep churn down with small business owners because small business owners in of themselves are volatile let me give you a visual so
(02:33) let's imagine this is kind of representing the the es and flows of the revenue of a small business now let's say they decide to work with you here they say you know what we're going to sign up with you and you get paid now maybe you start advertising the business and then the next month they make a little bit more money hooray everyone's happy now the next month the normal volatility occurs or maybe because you sent them more customers than they could handle they say hey maybe we need to ease off a little bit and all of a
(02:58) sudden they think to themselves wait a second I'm back in the same position I was before but now I've got still more customers than I had before that and now you know what I'm actually making less money the next month and so what happens here they they become one of these for you they cancel right this is the point of cancellation and so what happens is that there's many businesses like small agencies that do lead generation for small customers and continue to wonder what do I need to do in order to make my
(03:29) business sticky and they kill themselves trying to figure it out when the problem is inherent to who they serve is that they are volatile and as a result your business will be volatile too it reflects on to you now to give you an absolute hypothetical extreme here to give you an example Shopify is what most would consider world class or best-in-class for customer retention but they serve by and large prosumers meaning consumers who want to start a business and let me give you a stat that might blow you away
(04:01) 60% of their customer stay year but 40% leave and that's the best in the world and so in thinking about this you'll typically need to have a business that has almost a zero cost of servicing the smallest business owners if that's the game you want to play if you want to be Walmart then you have to orient your entire strategy on basically a zeroc cost basis for providing value which works in softare Ware companies or like Walmart where the entire model is structured such that it creates the smallest cost to them so their
(04:38) alternative is really not having it at all right now there was one agency that did really well with this Mutual acquaintance of mine what he did was that he basically provided marketing services but for about $299 per month now what he realized was this vola and this was a guy who used to charge a lot more than that what he realized is that with this volatility he had to price to their worst month and so it's like okay what's the lowest part of this this volatile range this wave of Revenue that these small businesses are going to encounter okay well then I'll just put
(05:13) my price here and that way I'm so cheap that they'll never cancel and the cost of them doing the services that he rendered which was actually far less than the guys who were charging call it $1,500 a month which is probably like the industry standard for a small business or local local business lead genen all of a sudden he's one fifth the price but he just provided still more value than the $300 and so it still felt like a good deal here because all you would do is you would optimize their Google stuff get them a few leads a few phone calls a month and for them they're like okay if I get a couple customers
(05:47) it's worth it this it's so expensive relative to what they made that if you weren't saving the day every single month the question they'll always ask is what have you done for me lately this is one of the big misconceptions that business owners have and I've made this myself we which is you see this right you see this Delta that you created you're like look you went from $1 sign to $2 signs all of this extra money was because of me right but the thing is is that if you make someone $10,000 right in the first month you work with them and let's say you charge them a th000 in your mind you say oh well this 9k is
(06:18) because of me which means I just bought another nine months of service with you right because I made you $9,000 I charge 1,000 bucks a month so I could basically just break even for the next N9 months but try actually having that conversation in reality it doesn't work that way what happens in reality is this they pay $11,000 they make 10 they make the extra nine and they say oh that $11,000 was worth it this month and guess what happens next month you start at zero actually you start at negative 1,000 because they've already paid you a th000 and they
(06:49) haven't made any money yet and so again it's always going to be relative to when they pay and what they get relative to that and so this is where this volatility ends up becoming a trap for most business owners and when you're starting a business or even when you're a few years into the business you'll often sell the people that you relate to and so you'll sell out of your own wallet to solve your own problems but the problem there is that those people will never become reliable it's like building your business on a foundation of sand it doesn't matter how beautiful
(07:20) of a castle you can imagine in your mind one bad storm on on a foundation of sand and it's going to topple over and so you end up just getting in this endless cycle of trying to iterate your products create different offers and all this stuff but the fundamental issue is you're serving somebody who's never going to who's never going to stay in pay because of them not you so for example if you have a supplement business it's unlikely that you're going to get very high stick if you're super expensive and your product Suite is only geared towards beginners and beginners
(07:49) turn out as in they go to the gym they stop going to the gym they go to the gym they stop going to the gym now if you had a business that was geared around the regular user or somebody who already let's say takes protein every day and you truly have a Superior product and then that entire base of people who takes protein shakes every day is willing to take yours instead of someone else's then you have a customer that is already a qualified customer who's going to continue to take the product over and over again but when you target beginners whether it's b2c or B2B obviously the
(08:14) price differences are significant between businesses and consumers but they are still beginners within that Continuum and so you will have the churn in relation to how much of a beginner they are and so my preferred way to think about this is if you think about this pyramid as representation of the marketplace based on their spending power right if you know at the base you're always going to have the most people that have the least amount of money to spend and so whether it's B2B or B Toc like b2c it's going to be base
(08:39) beginners for whatever it is that you sell if it's B2B it's going to be the smallest business owners so it could be you know consumers becoming prosumers or prosumers becoming vnbs which is a very small business and then vmbs becoming smbs which is small business owners and then and then you have low midm market midmarket and then you all you go all the way up to uh you know Fortune 100 companies right my preferred way to structure a business model is to actually start at the top and the reason for this is that because there's little
(09:02) operational drag because you have fewer customers you need to take care of they're able to spend significantly more they are going to be around a while and they know their numbers and they can stick with their commitment so if you have a contract for example and they say they'll pay you a million dollars a year the likely they pay you is significantly higher then a beginner saying he's going to pay you $10,000 over 10 months very unlikely I would make that bet so much so that corporate debt is an entire investable asset class based on the
(09:24) promises that business make to repay things the cool part about this from a branding perspective is that you learn how to service SE much higher end customers and with that reputation then there are customers who are going to be underneath who are then going to say you know what I would love to be able to work with somebody who works with the 400 I can't afford that you say you know what I can make it a little bit more affordable for you but you're going to get a little bit less service for that and you can work your way down now
(09:47) here's where it gets really clever is that as you work your way down you're consistently making more money and at this point when you go further and further down this this Rabbit Hole you're going to be able to spend the money it takes to create the automated solution or the software based or technological based Solution that's going to have a a near zero cost basis for you as a business owner so that you can profitably serve this itty bitty these itty bitty dollar signs here without the headache associated with beginners fundamentally if you sell to
(10:19) beginners you're going to have to either sell a really big ticket one time that's based on an emot emotional purchase and you're doing what I would consider a smash and grab business solar for example is kind of what I would consider a smash and and grab business people go in they sell the they sell solar and then it's on the roof and then that's kind of it and so it's really just massively just trying to sell every single person that exists and that's all there is to it or you have to create something that's the price to Value discrepancy is so absurd because what's crazy about this is that the price to
(10:47) value for poor people actually has to be higher than it is for the people at the top because here's the part here's the part that people Miss think about this there are people who cancel the $12 per month Netflix charge like what else could Netflix offer they give you like every movie you could imagine every new shows they do everything and still some people are like you know I'm not really sure if it's worth it for me right and so if you take that as hypothetical cream you can take the same thing for
(11:12) for Spotify how how about I give you every song that is possible in in the universe you have access to it whenever you want on your phone in your pocket eight bucks is a lot eight bucks is a lot for that right I don't know Mr Spotify right and so this the thing is is like I know many of you have these businesses and are wondering looking at yourself and like what more can I offer it's not about you you have the wrong model serving the wrong customer and so you have to have a cost basis as low as possible with a crazy high price to Value discrepancy so so you know values
(11:43) up here prices down here this huge Delta so that even on their bad months they're like you know what even though I lost my job structural turn I'm still willing to pay the 12 bucks for Netflix and so I talk about this at length in the $100 million offers book and and I have this really good visual that I want to show you this is how crazy it is the thing you sell doesn't even need to materially change in order to make it ready and available for the highest end customers all right so let's say that you sell
(12:12) time management all right and you sell to all these people well you're going to have to have a probably a $19 price point see very Mass Market 19 bucks maybe the next level is like okay well I want to do time management for sales professionals well for sales people maybe You' be able to charge $99 okay more because sales people were like all right well you know one sale might pay for this now what if you then go up to time management for outbound B2B sales so this isn't just people selling memberships or car washes or cleaning
(12:40) services this is now people selling let's say enterprise software where they're making $2,000 a sale in commissions or whatever so for them to pay $500 basically it's a quarter of one sale so they're willing to do that now let's go all the way up now we've got time management for outbound B2B Power Tools and Gardening sales reps so super specific and high ticket you get super niched down and you could sell it for $2,000 but fundamentally time management is time management and so the likelihood that the product that you're selling is really materially different between these these these different avatars is
(13:12) is is unlikely but we're choosing to purposefully narrow down who we sell to so that we can make more money and have less operational drag and have less structural churn as in people canceling for reasons outside of what we've delivered and as a result have a much more stable business that can compound year-over-year by the way I do have an entire extra chapter on this that I wrote between my offers book in my leads book called uh your first Avatar and it was kind of like a single that I produced between the books uh I think you get it for free at acquisition. comom Avatar I think that's what it is
(13:48) um and if not you probably Google it and you'll probably find it but it's free just pop in your email we'll tell you and we'll send it over to you so step two is to ask not tell your customers now what do I mean by ask so I'll tell you a quick story so Paul Graham said this and I remember hearing it and it just like got singed into my brain he said you can solve every business Problem by simply talking to your customers and I thought that was such an elegant answer and also true it's easy to make a py response it's hard to make it useful and valuable all the time and this is one of those rare instances
(14:22) where it's both and so I'll tell you a story so when I had Allen which was our software company which is the third company that I started after 2016 I originally made in my mind to serve gym owners once we spent a million plus dollars on developing this thing and actually rolled it out to gym owners we had this big obvious problem that came up which is they said oh this is so great this will work all my leads by the way can you help me get more leads and I was like oh no we completely missed the mark and so what ended up happening is that in my mind I could see that they
(14:54) had this problem that they weren't working their leads but what I didn't realize is that there was only a very specific amount of Custer customers that had that problem and so then I had to think oh gosh okay so I have two possible scenarios I can either only go after gym owners who already know how to generate leads consistently which we're talking like a tiny tiny tiny Marketplace and and here's the caveat that Marketplace still can't pay that much so bad Market to go after small and has not a lot of money and shrinking ye right not a good market so I thought to myself okay well what businesses always
(15:26) have lead G well the solution came to me when an agency owner actually reached out to me and said hey could I use this for my business to work the leads that I'm generating for my small business owner customers and I was like oh wait a second small business owners will turn in and out of the agency services but the agency will stay because they will bring new customers in use our software and even if they turn out with them the agency will stay with me and so the agencies had much more reliable Revenue
(15:55) than their base customers did because they could reliably sell you know 10 new customers a month to to offset the 10 customers they lose or whatever and so many of them were still stable businesses even though they had lots of churn which the fact that they couldn't necessarily have the skill set to grow their business wasn't necessarily a problem for me so to the same degree with the CRM there are some crms that are very successful even that serve small business owners but they have to match the pricing to the spending power of that small business and Shopify for
(16:24) example probably makes more than almost any e-commerce company on the platform we'd have to fact check it but is probably pretty close and so the platform itself actually makes more than the opportunity Secrets it enables so this is definitely one of those situations of selling the shovels rather than panning for gold and so once I realized that gym owners were not the customer and agencies were the customer I was able to start asking agencies for the correct feedback and that is when we were able to continue to iterate the product in a way that actually served
(16:53) the right customer so fundamentally when it comes to product or service based businesses there's I would say two schools of thought around product iteration one is kind of the rank and build model which is basically you ask your customers to just vote up vote and downvote the potential things that all of them have asked for and then the one that gets to the top that month you then say this is the one that we're going to build and then you do the build cycle and then you ask it again and this is not a bad way to do it it's a different way to do it and what ends up happening when you have a
(17:30) business like this is that you keep building more and more things and so this can result in kind of these Frankenstein type businesses but some customers are okay and want to have all the features and so this is kind of like a PC versus MAC kind of product strategy difference so the PCS is like you have all the customization all the different add-ons all the features that has all these different ways you can use it but can sometimes be more arduous in terms of uxx or user experience user design than a Mac now if you're like how does this apply for a service business it's literally the same it's just that the features that you're building are going
(18:07) to be around the services that you provide rather than the actual physical product or software that you're building but it works the same way the Mac style of this is trying to take every single thing that people want right up and down up and down and then trying to go from the ultimate experience at the end and then reverse engineer it into a elegant solution that purposely removes some things because it interferes with the other experiences and so when you do the kind of rank and build model there's lots of kind of conflicting contingencies like different customers
(18:40) want different things and some of the things that you build for One customer might actually impact negatively another customer and so when you do that all of a sudden you can lose now here the downside is you're not going to be able to serve all the needs of every customer because some of those specific if you're really specific about stuff then you might want to have one of these Solutions and so basically the customer base that buys Mac stuff is unsurprisingly different than the customer base that buys PC stuff and so
(19:05) for example at school our product strategy is much more based on this which is how do we create the most elegant simplest solution so that we can help people who are starting out build a business online and so if we have all of this customization and things like that you might serve somebody who's like I want a white label I want to whatever right now to be clear these businesses can obviously still get wildly big and successful apple is a $3.
(19:34) 8 trillion company Amazon which also kind of follows this model is a you know also trillion doll plus business and so there are different strategies that you need to decide which one you want to pursue but both of them work you just can't do both so there's two questions that I fundamentally like to ask when I'm trying to go through this product iteration cycle so the first one is if there was only one thing that was left after I deleted every other component of my service product what one thing would you want me to keep the second version of that question is the equal opposite if I kept everything except for one
(20:06) thing what thing would you not care at all about and then you delete that thing and you see who complains and to be clear you don't announce that you delete it you just delete it and then see what happens and then if you get complaints you ask yourself the question are these the types of customers that I want to keep because sometimes the people who complain are the ones that you don't want in which case win-win for more info on this I cover this at length in the referral section of $100 million leads
(20:31) and so in the referral section I talk about how do you get more people better results so this is fundamentally product iteration and so the idea here is how do we increase the perceived likelihood of achievement the process that I like to follow here so I have our action steps right so you survey customers to find the ones who get the best results step one step two is you interview them to find out what they did differently all right so this is a behavior thing so on one level you want to look at demographics do they look different the second is do they have a different user
(20:57) path do they come in a different way do they have a different promise number three and this is the one that we're referencing here is did they take actions that not everyone necessarily took we look at those actions that only those people had in common and then what we do is we take those actions and we force new customers to repeat those actions on purpose that the best customers did by accident and then we measure the Improvement of the average customer based on those new behaviors that we're incentivizing them towards or at least pushing them towards and then what we do if you want to get really
(21:24) fancy with it is you can match the conditions of your guarantee to the actions that get the best results to get more people to do them said differently if you realize that the best customers for example import all of their contacts into your CRM when you're starting the CRM you would then try and create the onboarding experience and a guarantee says hey we will guarantee that you'll have some improvement using our software service product as long as you export and import all of your contacts into our CRM within the first 30 days and so now we have shown our hand to say this is
(21:55) very valuable to us and it will be valuable to you this app process can fix any Department that's customer facing obviously it can't fix it but it can fix marketing so if all of a sudden your ads aren't doing well show your ads to customers and ask them what's missing or what's what's not working why would they not respond to this what ads did you find that resonated the most with you because I want more people like you product you're say okay what's wrong with this picture what show me what's difficult watch users actually interface with your
(22:26) product or services so that you can understand the friction points before during and after and so I like to use the three term contingency of before during after to think through any kind of change that I have for a customer what's going to happen immediately before they buy my product what's going to happen immediately before they use my product what's going to happen during the time that they use the product like what are the interactions they have and then what happens immediately after right and those are the places that we are have the closest and strongest leverage over the ultimate customer
(22:50) results and the value that we provide and same thing with sales like if people are getting on the sales calls and they're not buying then you ask customers what about my offer what about the way that we're presenting it is not compelling to you and just as valuable sometimes more if you can get them is interviewing the people who said no and say why not one of the best things you can do is just pay them like I'll pay $100 to hop on a phone call with me and just tell me what we could have done better and you know what's crazy is that a lot of times you just even doing that
(23:13) does give you a second shot at the sale which is by no means the uh objective you just want to get the information because that information is so much more valuable than the $100 and maybe the hour that you'd give so number one once we've picked the right customers who aren't going to have structural turn based the business model that we have two we have the the thing that that type of customer wants well we need to keep improving that product so we don't get outcompeted in the marketplace by new entrance or new businesses who are trying to take our slice of the pie the
(23:41) third thing that we have to do to make your business Unstoppable is don't pretend to be something you're not and you're like what does that even mean so let me tell you this quote that I love and then I'll get in the story this is by Shane Parish success comes down to doing the obvious thing for an extraordinary period of time without convincing yourself that you're smarter than you actually are and I love this quote for a number of reasons first off because it's so true here's my easiest visual for you actually I'm going see if
(24:04) I can get the right right colors for the markers so this is going to be a tough one let's see if I can do draw this I've never drawn this before so forgive me if this sucks oops that up looks like a dog with a cly Q so this is a pig not a dog and so and so here's the saying that I love about this oh it's cuz I put a dog nose on it I should have put I should have put little little little front snout okay well whatever you get the idea so if you put lipstick on a pig it's still a pig and so if you put a little bit you sprinkle a little bit of software into your service business it's
(24:57) still a service business right and so if like 90% of your Revenue comes from service and here's the here's the tricky part if 90% of the value comes from the service they will still determine that it's a service-based business and arguably the likelihood that you will get the economics that a software company has with the service business is low let me tell you a story to illustrate the point so there was a Solar Company that I was talking to that had 400 sales guys so a big Solar Company that did very well and the founders uh were young enterprising guys super ambitious they came to me and said
(25:29) hey we want to have a monstrous valuation for my for our company and I said I think you already do have a monstrous valuation for your company they said well we know that software companies get valued significantly higher than kind of the transactional sales nature of solar and I said you're right and so what and so they were like well we have this software that we have that we use to recruit salespeople and make them more productive and that's why we have such a big and productive sales team and so we were thinking about was
(25:56) taking that software and then licensing it to other solar companies and I told them that I thought that was a terrible idea now why would I say something like that well in theory if you had a software company that had the same Revenue metrics as your solar sales company then you would have a significantly more valuable company but number one is for you to get those same economics you're not selling $30,000 things the likelihood that you'd be able to get even close to the amount of Revenue per customer would be significantly lower number two is the amount of people that can buy solar
(26:26) roofs versus the amount of solar companies is way smaller third neither of these Founders were software people and so what they wanted to do was kind of like pretend to be software and just say like oh we'll just sell some people into this thing and then we're going to get a software multiple on the entirety of our Revenue that's not how it works you have to remember that the person who's writing a 100 200 500 billion dollar check is smart enough to have a 1002 200 or a billion dollars to spend they know the difference between a Solar Company and a software company software companies and companies that get
(26:57) extraordinarily High multiples don't get high multiples because of the name or the label that's associated with them they get those extraordinarily High multiples because of the nature of the revenue and the quality of the revenue that they have and the potential for gross profit in the future and so if you have a service based business that has the exact same economics as a software company you will get software like multiples and Enterprise Value you want to solve for the things that matter which is you want to solve for Revenue
(27:26) retention you want to solve for incremental margin you want to solve for logo retention over meaning number of businesses that are staying on on your platform or on your inside of your business you want to solve for being able to onboard low value people to be able to provide high value Services right so this is where like a tech enabled service can be more valuable than a traditional service because a tech enabled service might be able to take one person and have them serve 50 customers rather than one person and
(27:51) have them serve five but it's not because it's Tech enabled it's because you have now 10x the value that any individual employee can provide and lower the skill barrier for somebody to provide that value and so that translates into higher gross margins lower cost of acquiring talent and higher percentage of customers that stay every year which means that the business will compound year over year every year and so you can wash away all of the labels that people ascribe to business and simply boil it down to the metrics and the unit economics of the business
(28:24) to then ascertain fancy word figure out what the Enterprise value multiple of the businesses because it's only going to be a discount off of how big and How likely that bigness is to occur in the future for an investor a lot of small business owners entrepreneurs want to get the maximum amount of money for their business in the future and that makes sense you should do that but the way you do that is not by trying to pretend to be a different type of business it's not by taking your you know lawn care business and trying to say actually we're a s we're a software
(28:52) business is not trying to take your e-commerce business and saying actually we're a platform it doesn't work that way it all boils down to the actual math and so the easiest analogy is if you think about your business as a pig and this is the world's ugliest pig if you put lipstick on the pig it's still a pig and so if you put lipstick or you sprinkle some software on your lawn care business or your local service business it's still a local service business and one of the mistakes that I honestly see
(29:17) all the time is where people will take their service say I'll give you the service for free if you use the software but here's the problem the revenue will look just like service Revenue and so just because you Bill through a software system if you still have the same churn as a service business and the same margins as a service business then they will still value you like a service business you'll get valued based on a multiple of bottom line which is fine it's just not going to be a Top Line multiple or some big number on top of
(29:46) that because that's not the nature of the business you're in and that's okay so I think just leaning into who you are and what your business really is rather than wasting a tremendous amount of time trying to be something you're not not would serve a huge percentage of business owners they think because the grass is greener on the software side man they're getting 10x value multiples well do you know how hard it is to get 80% of people to stick on a software and do it in a way where you're making that kind of money but it's but it's at $50 a month instead of $5,000 a month well
(30:18) they kind in some ways it's like they kind of deserve it right like all of a sudden it's like it's really hard to get 5,000 customers to pay $1,000 a month for B2B software really tough but is it is it is it nearly as hard to do some sort of service at that level probably not and so when we think about it from that perspective the differences between valuations actually equalize I'll tell you one more story on this so I recently invested in a treatment center and we were talking about uh the business model and so basically there's two there's
(30:50) more permutations but this said simply there's two kind of models in the treatment world so model one is you stick with primarily insurance and you get people to you know the insurance companies send you people who need to you know come off addictions detox Etc and you get paid a fix kind of rate per day based on the insurance that the person comes in with the second type of company is more you know private insurance and cash pay where people are just paying out of pocket or they're paying with you know I would say premium insurances where they could pay somewhere in the neighborhood of like
(31:17) $3,000 a day so way more money per day than maybe the uh insurance-based uh detox business for example now which business do you think gets higher multiples the insurance-based one because the likel that the insurance pays is high and the likel that you're going to keep getting customers from those insurance or Medicare companies things like that is high and so it becomes a reliable business but the margins are lower and you have to deal with more volume now on the alternative side on the cash Bas side you might have call it half the Enterprise multiple value so instead of getting a 10x maybe get a five or 6X on the value of the
(31:49) business in terms of bottom line but if you can charge two or three times more return on effort might actually be the same or even better in the cash pay I make this point to say you don't want to try and build for some label that you think someone's going to ascribe to you you just want to build for the ultimate Enterprise Value which may just be doing better with the thing you have which is mo more times than not the right move which is why I'll resay this quote that I said at the beginning which is Success
(32:15) comes down to doing the obvious thing continuing to build your business for an extraordinary period of time much longer than you think without convincing yourself that you're smarter than you are without actually changing the label of your business trying to pretend to be a software company trying to pretend to be a platform trying to pretend tend to be Tech enabled just do what you do and do it well and do it for a long time and it always takes longer costs more and it's harder than you expected to be but it's the expectation that was the
(32:38) problem not your plan so now that we have the base we have the right customers for the model that we're in we have a way to iterate our products that we stay ahead of the market and we have the discipline to continue to double down on the model we have rather than try and ascribe some crazy label make some reinvestments into things that aren't going to actually serve us once we have that base then you can watch this next video how to make so much money it should feel legal

(00:00) if people have to treat you a certain way for you to be happy then it means that your happiness is in their hands I get asked about mindset a lot on podcasts they're like when you're building a business or you're building a career there are stressors that come into play how we manage the circumstances or the conditions that come to us dictates how our life turns out everybody has bad stuff happen you probably believed and nodded your head like yeah everyone has stuff happen and then we choose to make it bad or good
(00:25) imagine for a second two children that are playing one child tells the other child your nose is really big or you're fat interesting is that the child who hears it is unaffected and the child who says it is unaffected they're like you're fat and he's like huh parent comes in and overhears it and she's like oh my God takes the child that was called fat Comforts them gives them the expectation that they should be upset and then tells the other one that that was bad and in a moment there was something that is now
(00:55) traumatic that otherwise wouldn't have been and so when we're kids we walk into the world with no meaning all we do is we we observe and then whatever the adults around us tell us and say this means that we take his fact and it's not true it's their interpretation of the world and we inherit them and then we spend the rest of our life trying to undo and examine these beliefs that we have been told by people that we probably don't agree with when something bothers you pull it out and look at and say what happened and why is this bad
(01:23) and what would it look like if it were good and so the two tools that I use are time and volume the volume example is thinking okay I'm in traffic if this happened every day would I be upset if it happened every day I'd probably expect it which means that I would not be upset about it because it's just how things always are if you want to make it positive you say well what if every time I got in a car normally it would take an hour and today it took 30.
(01:47) I'd be pretty excited about it and so all we did is just change the volume on the circumstance to recalibrate the meaning that we're choosing to ascribe to it good or bad I like to think of circumstances a lot like weather which is like you've got sunny days and you've got rainy days and the problem in my opinion is that people any day that it rains they say is bad and any day that's Sunny they say is good when in reality it just is it's just the weather contrast is what create the quote good and bad when really there's just a
(02:16) middle line and half of it's above and half of it's below then what we can do is artificially move the line in our minds by saying whatever this circumstance is what would it look like if it were worse and what would it look like if it were worse all the time and if so then maybe today's a good thing the second frame that I like to use is time a hundred years out but 10 000 years out how much is this going to matter the reason something affects you is because you have deemed it meaningful you've said it matters it's my world
(02:42) view that nothing matters with a capital M like nothing matters in the universe it doesn't matter there's this statue of a head that's in the Sands of Egypt all right and it's bigger than this whole room it's just the head it's worn out and then scripted along the forehead it says here lies crazy name who owned everything that the eye could see the immortal so-and-so and the only thing that was left was a worn out statue head that no one knew who he was and it was five thousand years old if that guy who ruled the known world to
(03:11) him wealth probably mattered right but does it matter no probably not I've relieved a lot of the pressure in my life so that I could make better decisions by zooming way out and thinking ten thousand years from now will this matter and if the answer is no does it matter to me and then if I can make the decision of like good or bad based on my new context that I created then I can live a life a lot easier and so for me that helped me decrease anxiety it helped me decrease sadness around certain circumstances and I'll
(03:38) give you the last example of this so I had a cat named Bill Chill Bill rest in peace homie Love the cat he died this is some freak heart thing or something so he died in like two years when he died I was bumped I was like this sucks then I thought to myself what if cats only normally lived six months how stoked would I be that he lived four times the normal length of a normal cat I was like I'd probably be really stuck I'd be like dude he lived a long life I can't believe we had him this long and all of a sudden my perspective around the death
(04:02) completely changed I was like I was so grateful that I got to have him as long as I did when you play with time and you play with volume first off we have to be aware of the levers of meaning that exist and then once you're aware of them you can start moving them in your favor and then looking at your current conditions through different lenses and say what would this mean if it were amazing what would the conditions have to be in order for this to be an awesome thing and then all of a sudden you just exit the game of happy sad and get to be
(04:25) your own own game maker at least that's what I tried to do when I get upset look at it pull it apart thing like is this real is this true is anyone doing this perfectly no but simply being aware of the fact gives you a lot more control over your own perception of life and the conditions that are presented to you

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video i'm going to tell you a story about how i solved to churn for the entire gym industry and i think there are a lot of things you can take from this both in the actual outcome itself but also the process that was used to achieve it one of the things i'm going to i'm going to rewind the time clock here so for those who don't know me i had a chain of gyms in california um i was founded in 2013 i had six gyms by by 2016 that i grew uh just using cash flow from the the growth of the facilities and so i was very good at the marketing
(00:32) and selling process of getting people in the gyms and opening them at full capacity which was kind of my claim to fame over time i then uh pivoted to licensing uh that acquisition system to other gym owners across the u.s right so that was kind of the the path and then jim mulch kind of took off from there there was a two-year stint in between there where i did turnarounds and i'd fill other people's gyms up uh for a percentage of the revenue that i was bringing in right so that was kind of that's the the long story short now fast
(00:57) forward and uh now we've got thousands of gyms right uh this is still a few years ago but fast forward in the story it's got a few thousand gyms at this time one of the issues is that all these guys are bringing people in the door but they can't retain them for a long time so they can convert them into members because we had a process around that which again was sales but uh they couldn't keep them for a long time right and this was and this wasn't because of the acquisition system they just couldn't keep any of their customers for
(01:21) a long time and so what's interesting about this is that this is for any type of service based business that has any kind of recurring you know uh revenue model whatsoever and so here's what i did to solve a problem that i did not know the answer to all right so this is the this is the takeaway that you can you can take from this so what i did was i said hey guys has anyone in this huge community uh achieved three percent monthly churn or less for six straight months all right so three percent monthly turn if you do
(01:49) the math on it let's actually look together shall we so if we want to see how much what percentage of your customers are staying and if you have let's say three percent monthly churns that's 0.97 right and let's say that this is for 12 months all right so we're going to go x to the y for 12 months that means that i'm going to keep 69 of my customers i'm going to lose 31 of my customers year over year if i have 3 monthly churn that's still a decent amount of customers that we're losing right just being real with you now 3 is
(02:20) like the top 1 percent of gyms i'll be real with you like most gyms do not do that the industry average is about nine percent now if you want us to have something that freaks you out let's just do this one together so nine percent means we're retaining 91 per month now we're going to do our little twisty twistiness so that we can do our fancy math we go x to the y and we'll do 12 months again right right look at the difference there 32 of your clients are still there meaning you lose 68 of your of your recurring
(02:50) clients if your monthly churn is nine percent this is why people don't want to buy these types of businesses this is what makes your business unsellable and so i had this problem right i was like all these gyms are acquiring customers and their industry average is that they're going to lose uh three quarters you know of their customers by the end of the year right right this is a problem because i'm going to have to keep showing them all these new tips and tricks to get new people in because literally by the end
(03:16) of the year they're going to have already turned over three-quarters of the customers right this is a problem so this is what i did i put a poll in the group and i said hey if you've had less than three percent monthly churn for six straight months i'd like to invite you to a round table so 20 people out of the you know thousands or so they were in the community at the time 20 all right it's a very small percentage said hey i i meet this qualification so i said okay so if you think about this math wise right i've already got the top one
(03:40) percent um i guess this is the top two percent but top two percent of the entire entire gym world and so i had them all together on a call and i said i need you to tell me every single thing that you do to provide uh excellent value or a customer surplus uh to your members right and so i went person by person by person and i would sit there and i was like and then what do you do and then how does that work and then why do you do that and xyz right and i wrote down every single thing that every one of them had and so by the end of this i had
(04:09) like four pages of notes right so this is what i did next so that you know we ended the call and so i looked through all the notes and then i re-categorized them because a lot of them were repetitive some of them were you know different you know one-off weird things and so i said okay it's clear that all of them do lots of things and the first one being they actually track it and focus on the metric which 95 of people don't even do which is why most people are poor number one second thing that all of them did is
(04:35) that they had lots of different strategies to to combat churn because they know uh that and you guys want to know something crazy of course you do we're watching the the world's coolest youtuber all right so uh if you let's say let's say you have a service that's 100 a month okay 100 bucks a month and let's say that your churn is three percent right because that was the that was the goal of these people right so three percent churn all right and so what i did was i did a hundred divided by three percent that's thirty three hundred dollars of
(05:09) ltv right lifetime value right lifetime amount of revenue they're gonna be able to collect over this customer if they pay a hundred dollars a month you're gonna get 33 months out of this person because it's 100 divided by 0.03 watch this same 100 price point remember i said the industry average was nine divided by point zero nine eleven eleven all right eleven hundred bucks is what the ltv of those gyms are so the people who had conquered their churn made three times more revenue per customer than everyone else
(05:41) but here's what's even crazier about that if you make three times more revenue per customer think about how much more profit you're making a lot more all right and this is why this is such an important thing so a lot of them were doing lots of things i consolidated all of the things into buckets and then i said what are the things that every single one of them is doing and you can think about this like a voting system if if if all of them are doing one thing then that's probably an important thing if i've got 20 guys and there's something
(06:09) that only one of them is doing it's probably not important because the other 19 are accomplishing the objective without doing it and so the goal is how little how few of these things are the things that are actually driving the outcome okay and so what i ended up figuring out uh after doing this entire process is that there were five things that they were all doing to maintaining their members now you can either say oh okay alex well the next five things that he's going to share are probably only for gyms yeah because humans are totally
(06:39) different in your business but anyways so let's rock and roll first thing that they were all doing all of them is that if someone missed uh and uh they're they're not showing up at the gym by wednesday of that week so they missed monday miss tuesday they escalated them and they had all of them had different processes around this some of them did it by friday some of them did it by tuesday but the end point was if someone was not consuming the service they immediately escalated it and would repeatedly try and contact them to get
(07:11) them scheduled for time to come in which means they had accountability around consumption number one number two the vast majority of them had exit interviews meaning if someone wanted to leave they would have to come in and talk to somebody and there's two benefits to this one is you get to identify the things that are wrong with your business because these people will tell you why they are leaving this gives you the opportunity to fix things that are not good which is great which is incredibly valuable data right number
(07:36) one number two is a lot of times people just need to vent and the things that they're venting about it sounds like pain means it can be solved which means a lot of times over half those people get resold into a higher level package it's like no one ever contact me is like well you're not in the contact me plan you're in the you know do-it-yourself plan you should get into the into the coaching level where we actually hold you accountable oh i didn't know you guys had that yeah we just didn't know that you needed that ah that's our fault
(08:00) we should have asked you better questions on the front end right right cool and then all of a sudden this person goes from being a loss and a cancel to being an ascension so number one they make sure people are consuming number two they save exit interviews so they can collect data and to send existing customers number three they all did member events all right so they had some sort of community component that happened on a regular basis the the extent to which they had it uh was different the cadence was different but
(08:32) i'll tell you right now that if you do it on a quarterly basis uh that usually works you know for in terms of bringing the community together you're usually in good hands number four is that they had handwritten cards that they would send out on a regular basis to each of the people in their community and some of them would send it out with gift cards to bring friends which is a great way to generate referrals as well some of them would just have it as appreciation some of them would give them some sort of kudos or or whatever and here's the
(09:04) key point about how these cards had to be written they had to be personalized all right so it can't just be hey thanks for being a member love you lots send er doesn't work it has to be hey charlotte you've really been advancing on your pull-ups and if you're like well this only works for gyms i'm not even going to comment on that use your brain can you personalize something to any kind of improvement that someone has had in your business probably hopefully but it's like hey charlotte you've made a lot of progress
(09:33) in your pull-ups when you got here you had to use the big thick black band and now you're using the yellow band which is you know twice is twice as uh hard in terms of the resistance level for you keep you know keep it up you're doing a great job and you're already down 10 pounds so they're also reminding them of the victories that are happening right on a recurring basis and the fifth one i honestly cannot remember what the fifth one was but the point of this story is the process of solving the problem right that was the point all
(10:02) right the process of solving the problem and that you can use this for any type of complex problem that you have and so the way that this is done this is called a consultative method but you go and you talk to experts in the space so if you sit on top of a community all of the solutions to all of the problems that you have already exist in that community someone has solved it and so all you have to do is get all the smartest people in one room and then interview them tabulate the answers use a weighing system of which of these answers comes
(10:31) up most frequently and then consolidate to what are the fewest number of these things that everyone is doing to solve this complex problem and a lot of times when you use that type of process and that type of thinking you will be able to solve the more complicated issues that come up in business and a lot of times the payouts can be rich and very rewarding all right oh remember the fifth thing every two weeks they were able to contact them on a personal basis independent of uh the service based stuff so it's just checking in on them
(10:59) as humans every other week or so so it's like hey you know imagine your phone buzzes with a text every 14 days every 21 days or so and it says hey uh just checking in how's life how's you know how's things how you doing um just just making sure everything's great and uh you know just want to help you you know accomplish your goals whatever right and so uh you get that text from your service provider you're like wow it almost appears as though they care isn't that wild of course it is and that is why people pay you to pay attention
(11:33) that is what they are literally paying for all right people want your attention and so do not automate what you should systematize it's one of the things i have when it comes to service as soon as someone finds out that communications are automated they stop paying attention because you stop paying attention to the communication that's a little a little nugget little little tidbit for you as well is that do not automate what you should systematize okay you can have a system around something just do not automate it
(11:58) because as soon as human touch is gone people stop caring about it all together and it actually withdraws goodwill from the goodwill bank account of your customers rather than depositing it's better to say nothing at all than to automate things for the most part many times i have found when it comes to customer success and getting people to believe that you give a which is kind of the point of most services okay so um the best way as a total side note of getting people to think you give a is to actually give a so with that
(12:26) i will leave you mosey nation keeping awesome if you're new to mozy nation welcome we love you we appreciate you keep being uh awesome we make these videos because there's a lot of broke people and i don't should be one of them um if i didn't say this at the beginning because i always forget my name is alex mosey i own acquisition.

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on everyone i've got a special presentation for you guys today this has been on my mind for um probably about half a week now um and it's gonna be about money all right everybody's favorite topic um and it's probably not gonna be what you think it's gonna be but it's gonna be really good promise so um one of the things that's top of mind is that i get a lot of conversations from entrepreneurs who are like i just want to be in the top one percent i wanna and the thing is is the people who are in the top one percent
(00:27) live a different way and they also don't live now the way they did to get here all right and so i'll tell you a quick story and then i'm going to show you what i mean with this beautiful pyramid and if you're listening then i'll try and explain it visually or audio wise so when i was um very early on in my career um or earlier than now right uh i was showing up to a mastermind event that i had it was the first mastermind event um i think we had 28 people who were showing up and all these people were paying 40 000 a year and i remember
(00:59) pulling up to our event it was in albuquerque uh new mexico and um they were walking into the hotel as i was pulling up right i was like nervous and excited and all that stuff and um one of the one of the girls monica guitar um uh was like as we're getting out of the car she was like i thought you guys were supposed to be rich and she literally said that and i still remember to this day because it was like such a moment for me um i don't even know if she remembers it but uh we were pulling up in a prius that had a crack across the windshield
(01:30) and a dent in the side door all right and this car was probably a six thousand dollar car tops right and the thing is is at that moment i was a millionaire like i had a million dollars in cash right um sitting in my bank account after taxes and yet i was driving a 6 000 car and so one of the things that i consistently see um is people outliving their means and this is that's not a new message but for some reason it still doesn't resonate with people and so i'm going to level up this conversation a little bit because you're like but wait alex i
(02:00) thought you now have a bentley which i totally regret by the way but i do have a bentley and we have a very nice home the thing is is a bentley for me relative to my income is less than one week's income for me income and so one of the important things to understand is the relative cost of any of anything that you have and so i have always used this back of napkin math to justify expenses all right and so as a result of that i always have lived on less than five percent once i started making money less than five percent
(02:35) of what i made which pretty much meant that until i was making a million dollars a year or more i lived on thirty thousand dollars a year right which is if you've heard my other story about once layla and i made our first hundred thousand dollars i told her this is awesome that means that we have three years of living if we make no more money all right because we knew that on on on 1500 a month we could live right decently comfortably and i'll tell you this comfort's nice but there's not that much more enjoyment you get out of like
(03:04) driving evently versus a normal car now i'm sure there's car people who are like whatever but i'll tell you that the incremental gain that i have in my life is not worth the money this is probably the last expensive car i'll ever have it's also the first really expensive car that uh we ever got but what i wanted to do though um and kind of shift the conversation is not just talk about you know making uh or spending a lot less than you make because i saw somebody recently who was one of our clients um they graduated from the program and
(03:27) then they went on to start an online business they were gym owner um and i saw the expenses that they were incurring and i was like man like that worries me you know what i mean it just it it worries me because i i see a lack of judgment um because you don't know how things are going to change i mean i think if the last year for anyone can say that things can change quickly and i want to have tons of dry powder tons of reserves to pull on if i need them and so for me i get more anxiety by having expenses and so for me to
(03:57) actually lower my anxieties i lower how much i spend and so if that's something that you can associate for yourself as in the less money i spend the more relaxed i am um then i would encourage you do it because for me it's been one of my kind of secret sauces of success is just like just don't spend a ton of money especially relative to what you make and so what i want to do for the rest of this is kind of first talk about what it looks like to get in the top one percent and then how to get there all right so right here you've got a pyramid and if
(04:25) you're listening um then you can listen along but there's four layers to this pyramid all right and this is kind of the top one percent pyramid the bottom layer of this is people who have these are considered high net worth individuals all right that means you have one to five million dollars in assets all right now this may surprise you but uh the people at this level and i've got my notes here so i'm going along with this um in the united states it's 1 in 69.
(04:53) so 1 in 69 people is has between one and five million dollars so being over a million is not even top one percent anymore um i mean it sort of is but like it technically it's a little like if you actually had one million dollars you wouldn't be in the one percent um but i find that but that's in assets not income right that's in assets not income you don't need to make a million dollars a year to be in the top one percent right and what's crazy to me is that the top one percent income is 400 000 a year but the top one
(05:24) percent in assets is only a million or a million and a half bucks how nuts is that it means people spend all their money that's what that means so if you have a top one percent income you should be way above the top one percent in assets but it doesn't work that way because people always want to show off and people can't think long term and the only thing that i've been continually reading about because i've been really pouring a lot into really reading a lot about monger and um and uh buffett so warren buffett
(05:54) and charlie munger who are founders and one of berkshire hathaway is how they live and how they think in terms of long term and so i'm going to transition to talking about how to get there but i'm going to finish this little chart for you so this is the top 1.5 percent roughly of the u.
(06:12) s is one to five million in assets and that's one in 69 so if you i for me i like the one in personally it makes it more real for me so 1 in 69 people all right now in the us the next level is very high net worth so you go high net worth to very high net worth individual for this it's 0.3 percent all right of people that's crazy now here's what it is in math that's one in 338.
(06:40) so one in 338 people is worth between five and thirty million dollars that's what they have in investable assets five and thirty million dollars i'm i'm purposely putting this out there to hopefully counter the instagram culture of flexing in front of a lamborghini or bentley right whatever because most people are broke like most people are poor and i i think that i'm gonna i'm gonna i'm gonna lay out a a a plan for you that's very simple to get you above this to really just be in the top one percent and the thing is is like i said the top
(07:14) one percent income earners or earn over four hundred and twenty thousand four hundred forty thousand a year depending on where you're looking that's per year so for you to get over five million like you just need to live on a lot less than you make if you're in the top one percent income earners you should be in this five to thirty million dollars within not a ton of time right and then the the level above that is ultra high net worth individuals which is uh one in 13 83 and that's uh what is that that's point zero seven percent all right point
(07:52) zero seven percent all right and then finally i'll just finish this little chart out um billionaires is uh one in 468 000 all right and uh and the percentage there is point zero zero zero four zeros three zeros three zeros two percent all right now the reason that uh the jump between the the third stage and the fourth stage is so large is that the range is between 30 and a billion so everyone that's between got between 30 and a billion is in the next level and then billionaire is the fourth category so these are kind of like the
(08:28) the four layers above the one percent the very first layer kind of gets you into the top one percent more or less right and then um above that you have the varying categories the thing is is that in order for you to get to above five million dollars so not even top one percent but top point three percent all right one in three hundred and thirty eight so you walk into the 238 people you're probably the richest person in the room all right for you to do that you got to save like 15 grand a year for 30 years that's it and that's
(09:03) assuming just nine percent returns which is just the stock market i just put in the s p 500 and don't do anything with it right that's not doing crypto that's not that's not that's not learning how to like it's literally just save a you know 1200 a month and and put it into the s p and do it every month that's it if you make four hundred thousand dollars a year so you're making thirty five thousand dollars a month right if you live on five you can put ten thousand dollars and you'll be at the you'll be at the top end of this right
(09:35) but everyone just spends so much money and so i i i just when i see this it's both incredibly encouraging to me and also incredibly saddening it's encouraging to me because i feel like genuinely everyone can get to the top one percent which doesn't make math mathematical sense but it makes it makes realistic sense and you feel like but alex how do i how do i save twelve hundred dollars a month right so it's two things it's income and time right net income being like minus your expenses so it means it's make more money spend less money the
(10:08) easiest thing most people do is they just spend too much money right and i know that sometimes you can like it's sometimes apparent depending if you like follow my instagram or whatever but like layla and i think i was asking for her to give me the numbers from last year but we live on less than five percent of what we make all right and you're like well sure that's because you make a lot yeah but i lived on that when i made nothing right and so i think most people like you should live on 30 grand 40 grand a year and the thing is is that you
(10:34) already know in your heart that spent making that spending more of the money is not going to make you happier i'll tell you right now it's not and if the point of spending money is to make you happier i'm telling you it's not sure like i have this studio i can justify it as a business expense um but i did this mostly because i enjoy it and to me from from a percentage of income it's negligible right and so i got this fancy setup only after i had already crossed three of these levels right i'm saying this because it just it
(11:10) frustrates me because i really believe anyone can do it i really do you should have to live on a lot less than you make and so anyways to finish this out right what do you do most times you're going to have to sell something right either you're selling someone else's product or you're selling your own product either way i say product i mean product service whatever right but either one of those categories and if you make a hundred thousand dollars a year a hundred thousand dollars a year and you live on 30 you
(11:36) can do this not only can you get into this quote bottom level the top one percent but you can get the top point three percent right now if part of you is like well you know that then what's what's the point of living it really depends on on what you value if like and this is kind of backwards because it's like the type of person who wants to have more money wants to spend the money they have then i can understand it but then at that point just don't yearn for more does that make sense so like don't be dissatisfied that
(12:05) you haven't achieved your goal for me what i'm looking at is like how can i get into this category by the time i die and use that to impact humanity like in a way that's that's meaningful that's what i'm that's what i'm trying to do right and so anyways i told you the prius story to illustrate a point which was i was a millionaire and living on less than three thousand dollars a month right um i owned my car our rent was 1200 bucks and layla and i lived on we bought food at the grocery store you know what i mean like we went out once a
(12:35) week like it wasn't like you can do that and live a normal life like a comfortable life and that was when we were making a lot of money and that's because i always have a fear or had a fear that i would i was like what happens if we stop making money i don't i just don't want to lose everything and so i think if you can be satisfied and decrease your anxiety or make the amount that you spend decrease your anxiety you will be happier so i'm going to leave you with this one piece as a final note on this which is the simple retirement
(13:05) calculator all right world's simplest retirement calculator so if you live let's say let's say that you are currently uh 30 years old all right so you're currently 30. and um you want to retire all right so let's say you want to retire soon let's say you want to retire by the time you're 40. all right crazy you're going to try and retire entirely by your 40.
(13:31) okay cool i dig it so if you're a retired boyfriend i'm saying retired but realistically you're going to work because you like working but let's just say that you won't you don't want to have to work you want to work on the stuff you like working on after you're 40. cool no problem the percentage of your income that you spend is going to be the thing that dictates how quickly you can retire not how much you make so for example if you make 400 000 a year like i said right and you save 10 right versus making a hundred thousand dollars
(14:04) a year and you saving uh let's say eighty percent is what you save then what you're what you every year you're adding four years of retirement because it means that you're spending 20 and saving 80k whoo that's great that means for every year you're getting four years back which means if in 10 years at this point you'd have 40 more years right once you hit 40 because you had 10 years of stockpiling for each year right you'd have 40 years of living now mind you that's assuming it's your current level and that the money that
(14:40) you now have saved up at this point because you should have 800 000 right and that's assuming that none of the money you had made any money so it'd probably be closer to like 1.2 right million by the end of that decade that's really conservative still maybe even 2 million right at that point that this money isn't even making you money that's just literally assuming a straight decrease in how much you spend right that every year would just go down which isn't even realistic right but if you did that then you'd get
(15:06) there and that's on 100 a year right that's it on the flip side if you're at this 10 guy then every year he gets one tenth of a year right because he's saving 40 it costs him 400 to do a year which means that this guy is never really going to be able to retire right and he's always going to be stressed or she's always going to be stressed and so i say that only to illustrate one point which is you have to spend less than you make it's sometimes a simple that people don't want to do and it means that you can either have
(15:36) your ego and how you look to everyone or you can have your ego based on the freedom that you feel and i know that the vast majority of people will never do that i get messages every day from people who are like you know they've been trying for 10 years to make a million dollars a year rather than maybe trying to make a hundred thousand dollars first right and the thing is is to be in this top one percent you don't need to make a million dollars a year not even close you're not even close you don't even need to make close to a
(16:01) million dollars here to be in the top one percent right if you just add a little bit of time you can get in the top one percent just being reasonable right you can get in the top point three percent by also being you know unreasonable because compared to everyone else right just because the thing is is most people are insane in terms of their irrational with their behavior and their expenditures they are stressed about the amount of money they spend and yet they are the they're in complete control of how much they spend just spend less
(16:31) and you'll be less stressed so anyways that is my money money message for everyone today um we still continue to less on live on you know five percent maybe ten percent of what we make i don't think we live on ten percent we live on five percent of what we make and the thing is is like at that point if you live on if you live in five percent or ten percent of what you make then it means that literally one year if you as like walk walk with me for a second if you live on ten percent of what you make and your money grows at ten percent
(17:01) then in one year you could retire assuming you have a stable income from the the savings that you had on the other 90 right figuratively one year 15 months whatever but you get the idea right does that make sense for everybody like if you live on 10 percent of what you make or you live like you're like but man that's like poverty levels it's like yes but it's poverty levels in your mind based on your perception not based on reality of the fact that you're going to be stockpiling money that will continue to feed you
(17:29) forever along you want right and so the the moral of the story is spend less than you make the the greater you can create that disparity the faster you can retire or get to a point where you choose to work on the things that only you want to work on right and getting into the top one percent is literally a matter of saving a thousand fifteen hundred bucks a month and putting in the s p 500 that's about it it's all there i mean like that's that's it that's all there is to it and the thing is is it's so simple no one will do it
(18:03) that's okay but you're a smart cookie and you're gonna do it because um you think that simple things are usually the keys to the universe which i agree with you so keep being awesome lots of love and i'll catch you guys on the flip side bye

Transcript:
(00:00) The reason you're dissatisfied is because you want things you don't have. And you are unhappy with the trades that you've made, but you want to keep the things you got from making those trades and then also retrade whatever it is that you gave to get what you've got for something else without accepting the downsides and trades of getting that thing.
(00:25) And so I was having this conversation with, you know, a friend of mine who's kind of in this his dating period of life trying to figure out, you know, who's going to marry and and whatnot. And he sends me these very long, you know, voice notes and and text messages about how it's like, should I, you know, should I have a stay-at-home mom type wife, a wife who's like, you know, career oriented or should I try and have somebody who would work with me? And he's just going through this this whole, you know, rigomeroll.
(00:48) And he's he struggled with this for a while. And fundamentally it comes down to this which is that he wants everything. And I'm not just saying this about him. I'm saying this about us, about all of us, right? It's like we want it all. And one of the the key, you know, formulas for getting dissatisfied with life is wanting everything with limited resources in terms of time, energy, effort, life, uh, in order to get them.
(01:14) And so I see this key thing, myself included here, that I'll do sometimes where I'll get something that I want and then I'll look at something else that's a different path and be like, I want that, too. But we used up the same resource to get it, right? It's like if you have gas in the car and you're like, well, I've got one tank worth of gas.
(01:34) You're like, I want to get to Toledo. And then you get to Toledo and you're like, I actually really want to get to, you know, Orange County. Well, all of a sudden you're like, I used up my tank of gas. It's like, well, I want to go to Orange County, too. It's like, well, you're in Toledo.
(01:49) You know what I mean? Like, you made that call. And so, it's interesting is that we regret the lives we have because of paths not taken without taking into consideration the trades we made then. And so one of the things that I that I feel like I've been practicing a lot has been this this effort of trying to play it out more, which is like, okay, well, let's say that we went to Orange County, not Toledo.
(02:15) Well, I might be thinking in Orange County like, man, Toledo's got all these things that are going on there and they've got these great sites and they've got, you know, more modest people and and and and and right. And so it's like all paths have things that you don't currently have. But the other part is like, okay, well, whatever path I choose not to play out also has costs.
(02:36) And so we have the perceived benefits of this other path which might not be as good as we think they are, right? And then we have these unknown costs which might be significantly worse than they are. And so I was talking to him, you know, about about this and I was like, well, listen, man. Like all three of these paths are fine.
(02:54) And I've seen really successful people who are in all three of these, you know, paths like stay-at-home situation, parallel situation, aligned or combined situation. All three work, right? But like wanting the the benefits of all three is what gets us in trouble, right? I think I saw Esther Peral make this clip where she was like the problems that we have isn't that like people are worse, it's just that our expectations are higher.
(03:17) It's like we expect our spouse to be uh professional, you know, a professional business person, to be an intellectual sparring partner. Um, uh, to be intellectual sparring partner, to be your, you know, if it's a guy, it's like your your maid and your housekeeper, also the mother and great parent, you know, for your kids.
(03:38) Um, also somebody who's like interested in the same hobbies as you, and also your passionate lover. It's like it's trying to cram 10 10 humans into one, right? Like you make trades, right? There are things that you're going to get and there's things that you're going to trade. And you know, we get we get dissatisfied when we just make trades.
(03:59) And I see this like kind of like for us as individuals that there's kind of these stages you go through. Like in the beginning, you just blame everyone else for why you don't have what you want, right? That's like stage one. Stage two, you learn how to get stuff. So now you get something that you want, but you're like, man, I want I want that other path, right? I want the benefits of that without the cost of that.
(04:19) But in my mind, I'm going to imagine getting both my current life and that life and then I'm just going to be dissatisfied since I don't have both. And I heard this really interesting quote, which I love. Not wanting something is as good as having it. Not wanting it is as good as having it.
(04:38) And I think about this trade all the way up, right? It's like when we die cuz people are always like, you know, I really, you know, they get to the end of their life and then they have these quote regrets. They look back and they try and like quote give advice, but like I actually don't take as much credence in that. And I'll explain why.
(04:51) It's not like I don't, you know, respect old people. It's more a human thing than an old person thing. just that when we die wanting another life or a different life, it really just comes down to I wish I had the benefits of another life while also maintaining the benefits of my own. And if someone's a little bit more astute, they'd say, well, I would trade the benefits of that life that's unknown for the life that uh for the benefits of the life that I have, but it still has kind of contained within it.
(05:19) You know, all these are known. So, you're still trading no you're trading novelty, right? Which makes sense. But it doesn't also doesn't actually inform decision-m in a good way. And so what ends up happening is we create this equation, right? Like life becomes miserable when you get when you want everything but have limited resources to get it.
(05:38) Which then you say I will be dissatisfied unless I get everything. And by the way, everything will change. The thing I want I'll change it as soon as I get it. I'll change it so that I can maintain dissatisfaction. Think about how wild this is. Like we proclaim that unless I get everything an impossible thing, I will be dissatisfied.
(05:59) So you might as well just say I choose to be dissatisfied. That is what I I demand this. Of course, the universe doesn't care. You're not going to get any of that stuff. Back to my friend, a lot of this I think comes down to commitment and expectations. When Leila and I decided to get married, you know, we uh we actually got married pretty fast and then decided to like look at marriage stuff right afterwards.
(06:19) But one of the things that we looked at was like what are the commonalities between marriages that last? And it's not actually what you think, but I narrowed it into two two kind of buckets here. And I think this goes for any endeavor, not just marriage, but like big life choices. High commitment, low expectations. That's the pairing.
(06:41) If you think about commitment as the elimination of alternatives, well then that makes sense that if you eliminate all alternatives that you will that by default you will stay you'll stay on the path that you're currently on whether it's marriage, whether it's business. So it's you just eliminate all alternatives.
(06:54) It's another shot you're committed and then low expectations which is like okay you're committed here. Maybe you don't get married but then you can either change reality or or lower expectations. So then you just have low expectations and you're not going anywhere. And the thing is is that if you have low expectations and you're not going anywhere, then reality is likely higher than your expectations, which ends up meaning that you're above expectations for the m for the rest of your life.
(07:19) And so that has always been my like whenever I feel like this creep of dissatisfaction or wanting more or things like that or wanting different. And to be clear, I this is not be sick. I figured out life here just sharing more just sharing a thought that I was thinking about for myself too. High expectation, low commitment.
(07:34) Cuz I played out the other way for him, you know, in particular. I was like, if you were in a in a town of 500 people and you were of marriage age, you'd have a pick of like 25 girls, right? And you'd be like, "Ah, the one I don't hate." Right? Like you'd be like, "All right, there we go." You know? And people have been doing that for much longer than they've been doing unlimited swipes.
(07:55) And so, like, we just have this very odd perspective on reality, which is that we want all of the upside and none of the downside. We want a perfect life and demand that we have one and then are dissatisfied when our lives are not perfect. We want all the upside like we want to trade. We want we want all the good stuff.
(08:14) It's like I want the I I'll play this out. So it's like I want the benefit of having uh a really short wife who's itty bitty, you know, whatever. And I also want a girl that's, you know, 61 and can like mother linebackers. Well, I want both. You got to pick one, but I want both. Okay, be dissatisfied or and just never choose, right? Like, like this is actually really really stay stuck because they can't decide.
(08:48) They're literally unwilling to make they'll literally just stay there. They just stay undecided and somehow expect to get more information about an apparent contradiction. like you expect that you're going to get more information. Like this is the choice. You have to make it. And if you don't make the choice, you don't get the benefits of either.
(09:09) And that's what's wild. And so like I think about this a fair amount because there's just so many choices that we have to make, right, throughout life where like some doors are are reversible, right? But the big doors in life are irreversible. It's hard to go back, right? Like you can't become 20 years old again.
(09:28) You can't marry another person again. You can't pick another business. I mean, you can you can get divorced from your business. It's just painful. There's wind down periods. You know who you know just it just it's p you know who who comes you know who comes with you to your to your new business who doesn't like it's a whole mess, right? So think you can get divorced from your marriage, right? You can do that but it's it's tough, right? And so we have these doors that we we can really only go through one time and people will just stand at the precipice
(10:02) of the door and just wait their entire lives never getting what's on the other side of either door or either path. And so I think like a prized trait is the ability to both make decisions and to make good decisions. And I'll give the third and this is me mostly talking to myself as you can see being happy with our decisions which I think is a significantly underrated skill.
(10:33) Like first you have to learn how to decide right if you don't make decisions you do nothing. Then you have to learn how to decide well so that your decisions work out. You get more of what you want. And then number three is that you have to not change what you said you wanted from the decision that you made and or just be satisfied with whatever you get on the other side of that decision with the ultimate obviously just being that you didn't want anything to begin with which is we can all become Buddhist monks until that day comes. I would say that
(11:01) it's been helpful for me to just simply recognize the trades that I made and say yes I am okay with this trade and then whenever I think about an alternative path just reminding myself well there would be cost on that path and the upside of that path is probably not as good as I think it is and so me just being real with you like I've been kind of about as happy or unhappy as I am now for like a pretty long time and I like this is me just being really real I I don't think I think if I were to play out three different lifetimes for me in
(11:34) different countries and and different upbringings, the whole thing, like I think I'd probably be about as happy or unhappy as I am now. Like I'm just being real. Like I just as much as I like and that actually just actually thinking that has dramatically decreased my anxiety around some stuff like my worries.
(11:57) It's just like wow, I'd probably be about as happy as I am now. I'd have different variables, but it would probably equate to where I'm at. So, I gave the tall girl, short girl for a girl example. It's like maybe it's like a richer guy, a poorer guy. I don't know. I don't know what the example would be. Maybe it's a richer guy. Sorry, a taller guy and a shorter guy for girls. I don't know.
(12:16) But the idea is like fundamentally like there's just going to be trades that you're going to make and everyone might think, "Oh, no. I would definitely want the rich guy." Well, let's play it out. Let's actually play it out. Look at the wives of rich dudes. Are they happy? Not always. Look at the wives of poor dudes. Are they happy? Not always.
(12:36) Which basically just means humans will human. We will be dissatisfied independent of our circumstance. And that honestly at the end of the day like we are the problem. Like we are the problem. Like we think there's something like we are the problem. And so that's actually um my little like refrain that I have for myself whenever I have this little creeping dissatisfaction spider that that creeps up my neck.
(13:05) I just hear like you are the problem. You are the problem. And then I think okay I am the problem. What expectations do I have that I set arbitrarily for myself that I deemed dissatisfactory when the world did not meet them? I'm like, "Oh, okay. Well, if I just remove that, it's as good as having it." Great. Good to know. So, anyways, love you all.
(13:31) Just a little morning thoughts. It's uh 5:40ish here at the office. We're really excited for the book launch. It's going to be epic. I've been basically preparing for two years for this. Um, basically is a the incorrect word. I have been preparing for two years for this. Um, and so, uh, I'm excited to finally show you what I've been working on this whole time. It's going to be really sweet.
(13:54) And I had to somehow outdo last time, which was, uh, awesome. So, it's like, how do I, how do I do better than that? Come and you will see. Uh, otherwise, be awesome. I'll catch you guys soon. Bye.

(00:00) the vast majority of businesses are stuck because they're working on the wrong stuff the entrepreneur likes doing a certain thing they keep doing a certain thing but will got you from Z to a million or 1 to 10 million isn't what's going to get you from 10 to 30 there's a much harder problem that's in front of you that you have to confront rather than Sid stepping and getting distracted and looking at things that look like they're going to be better opportunities with the skills you have the biggest opportunity is the one that's in front of you and I want to share exactly how I think through what
(00:24) hard stuff do I push through and what hard stuff do I pivot through and being able to accurately identify what the real problem in your business is and it's usually not the one you think it is in the very beginning when I got in the gym business I thought the gym business was about results I thought it was about results and I thought it was about like killer killer workouts and it was really about neither of those things um the gym business is actually about sales and marketing and so I got into it because I was like I'm passionate about Fitness I'm passionate about getting people results but what
(00:55) what actually drove the business economics was sales and marketing the big problem is that with gyms as you might imagine a lot of people don't actually like going to the gym like it has inherent difficulties the good news in the gym business is that everybody wants to get in better shape and so you have this massive Market but people tend to turn out of gyms even the very lowcost gyms like a lot of people have this misbelief that they think like oh well Planet Fitness or Crunch Fitness is 10 bucks a month so of course no one
(01:19) cancels but they actually have five or 6% monthly churn they just have a ton of people who sign up every month as well and so the key that I didn't know is that the the businesses that are the biggest in the fitness space and this is when I got into it was they're actually just Marketing sales machines they know how to train sales they know how to recruit for sales they know how to Market on a number of different channels to get customers in the door and so once I learned that I started growing my gyms and I was started realizing that was the
(01:42) business I was really in then later on I got into uh prestig Labs which is my supplement business and I thought that I was in the product business so I thought it was going to be about all the ingredients that I was using I thought it was going to be about like how efficacious in all the studies that we could prove and so I got Dr cashy who's a genius biochemist got his PhD when he was 20 years old in Biochemistry which is absolutely absurd and I got him and he was you know he he did all the stacks
(02:06) for the Olympic teams and things like that and I was like okay I'm going to have the best smartest person in the world make the absolute most efficacious product with the best ingredients but that wasn't actually the business I was in in in in in the subon business it's about brand media and distribution like that's actually the business you're in and especially if you have products that don't have a flavoring so if you have capsules of any sort uh then it really is just about brand and distribution now if you have a product that is like a uh
(02:36) like an ag1 right now people buy ag1 because obviously they're exceptional at media they're great at traffic they're really just traffic machines but people keep buying it because it tastes good right and so like they think it's like oh I'm going to it's because of all these all these little ingredients in there but like you don't feel healthy right like you don't know if your levels of whatever are changing you just know if it tastes good and if you create a habit around it and so again in that business it took me too long to realize that I was actually not in the product business again I was in the median distribution business then when I got
(03:06) into Allen which was my software company I thought that I was like okay I've learned my lesson this is all about marketing and sales like this is software I get it I've learned my lesson and then as soon as I got in the software business I knew I could sell everybody the software the problem was I had to actually make a better product because with tech especially it fundamentally automates some element of of work right that's what software does is it automates something so if something can be done precisely and done accurately and done quickly and with software ideally it's done cheaply or
(03:36) cheaper than people because that's how Tech Works in general then that's an easy thing to sell who doesn't want good fast cheaper better everybody does and so it's very easy at least in my experience it was very easy to sell software if you have a good product Market fit in terms of what you're trying to sell the problem was that my product wasn't good enough to deliver on the promise and so I got into it and was like okay cool I'll just hire an Outsource development team and they'll just build me whatever hour is they'll get the product done and then I'll market and sell it and sure we sold a ton I mean we went to 1.7 million a
(04:05) month in uh in six months in terms of in terms of uh run rate um and that was per month 1.7 million and so the thing is we were able to sell the crap out of it but I then quickly realized that uh the product just couldn't deliver and then I was like oh shoot I have this outsourced team that owns the product and that's not their core business because they're really just a shop that sells to anybody and their incentive is to just build me as much as humanely possible buy the the way if you run Revenue through any kind of software as soon as the development
(04:33) shop sees how much money you're making guess what happens to your fees they go up and unless you have someone who can check them and knows how to code or knows how to at least QA them you're you're screwed you're hammered and so I had no technical proficiency myself I had nobody on my internal team that was like a W2 employee or at least an equity employ anybody who actually knew code and so I was absolutely at their mercy and it sucked and so in that business in the software business you think you might be getting in the Marketing sales business but you're really becoming into the product business because if you if you fundamentally can make that promise
(05:06) which is good or faster cheaper uh then people are going to buy right but you have to make sure that you can fulfill that promise and so I learned that lesson too late we ended up selling it to a um a strategic buyer who could incorporate it into their big development team he was like I can rewrite the code you already have a big customer base and um we did an all stock deal now I'll tell you a story that that kind of made me think about this was the first thing that actually got me into this thinking process of what business are you really in and so um one of our gym owners from way back when when we
(05:34) had gym launch um was a successful gym owner and he started making money with his gyms and so he started buying airbnbs and so that was kind of like his investment strategy he start bu buying airbnbs in his local area and what ended up happening was he was like you know what I can drive margins up by just cleaning the houses myself instead of Outsourcing the cleaning and so because you if you have an Airbnb especially daily rentals like the cleaning is actually a pretty big part of of the business and so he started hiring his
(05:58) own cleaning staff and doing the cleaning but uh he was like wow you know what this cleaning business I could start cleaning for other airbnbs right and so he starts cleaning for other airbnbs and he's like okay this is actually a business and so he used all the stuff he knew for running his gym which he knew how to Market and sell because that's the real business you're in when you're in the gym business and so he starts marketing selling and we I had dinner with him um probably a year into the business and he was like and so I said okay give me LTV me give me CAC like how's it work he's like oh uh LTV is
(06:27) insane people never cancel and CAC is like $6 and I was like oh my God like why are you not making gazillions of dollars he's like you know the issue is actually Talent it's actually getting people who clean houses who show up on time and do a good job and don't steal and speak English and communicate with customers he's like that's actually the issue and it was right in that moment I was like oh this business isn't like the other business he was in this wasn't this isn't a gym business even though it's a local business even though it's service if you're in the cleaning business
(06:58) you're not in the marketing and sales business because selling someone on let me clean your house and do this stuff for you not that hard right and getting people to opt in for cleaning ads not that difficult selling them not that hard the hard part is actually delivering on it and getting people who want to do it on a regular basis a lot so I'll give you an example on the counter side for gyms getting Talent getting trainers getting people who are Fitness enthusiasts who want to train other people people do it for free like
(07:26) people like working out people well I'll say people who like working out like working out just put it that way like there are obviously people who hate working out but there are people who are Fitness enthusiasts now I have not seen a cleaning Enthusiast there's not this under you know this this underworld of all these people are like man I I'm just a cleaning Enthusiast I mean there are maybe some people but the vast majority of people see as a chore right and so getting talent for gyms is not hard
(07:48) getting talent for cleaning much harder and so once we we started walking through this I was like oh you're in the recruiting and training business and I just saw his his whole eyes changed I was like okay think about it like this you know how to acquire customers you have to Market you generate leads you work the leads you have a you have a sales call and then you onboard them and then you retain them and you send them I was like we need to flip that and so you need to think about what is my acquisition for talent how do I generate leads and applications for talent
(08:15) instead of sales how do I interview instead of uh instead of onboarding customers how do I onboard a new employee and how do I train them so that they can be proficient so that I can then manage or Ascend them up inside of the organization and so as soon as he flipped that he took the business from I think it was like $30 or $40,000 a month to over $150,000 a month within the next 12 months and it was just that idea of oh this is the big hairy problem I have to solve and so every business has a big hairy problem and and this has just been my own experiences that because I'm probably just a nan or an idiot I only
(08:50) learn about it once I get into it and so as a recommendation if you are going to enter into a new Marketplace talk to people who are in it and ask them what the hardest part of their business is and so I'll give you give you two more examples of this and and then I'll I'll transition to kind of why I think this is important overall so a lot of people uh who follow me just because they're in the consulting or the coaching or the information the education space because I talk about that stuff a lot now the thing is is if you're in that space what
(09:13) business do you think you're in now you have to learn how to Market and sell that's any business right but if you want to make it big look at the biggest consulting firms Professional Service businesses in the world what are they you look at McKenzie you look at Bane you look at eron young KPMG you look at the biggest firms accounting look at law look at Consulting what are what are they they're recruiting machines and it's because they know how to attract Talent train talent and make people more Val and they get the best and brightest people and so the reason that people can't quote scale in these information
(09:50) coaching Etc businesses is because they have one talented person which is the guru and then they hire a bunch of minions or people who are not even close to as good as that person and then over time what happens is it dilutes the level of service and it's a service-based business and so people are like man this thing sucks or this guy sucks or this business sucks but McKenzie Bane BCG ey those are built on the principle of how do we continue to raise the bar how do we get better brighter smarter people and how do we train them better than anyone else in a faster way so we can get better Returns
(10:20) on human capital as in the people themselves how do we get better Returns on the humans and so that's the fundamental Arbitrage if you're in a service based business where you spell sell expertise is the return on the Arbitrage between what you pay somebody and what you can charge for that person's expertise now the difficulty in that business is that when you train someone and they become really exceptionable they become really smart what do they have they have opportunities to leave they can take those clients with them and so there's a reason that most of these Professional
(10:43) Service firms at scale become Partnerships they become llps so you have I become a partner at McKenzie I become a partner at the law firm I become a partner at the accounting firm because if you have a ton of very very smart motivated people they eventually will leave to start their own business or you have to show them a path where they can become an owner within the business they're in and this is just playing it out and so this is why I bring this up because a lot of people don't know what it looks like at scale
(11:07) like you have to bring in very intelligent people and have a system or incentive process that gives them uh a taste in the long run so that the opportunity or the risk adjusted return of them leaving versus them staying it still makes more sense for them to stay or at least for a good portion of them to stay now I'll give you one more example and then and I'll flip to why I think this is important in terms of identifying this for your own business so investing I thought it was about doing lots of deals at good prices and to some degree it is but in reality at least in my experience it's been way more about
(11:36) learning how to say no at a much higher velocity um to a much higher number of deals because you only need one Facebook and so it's kind of this counterintuitive thing where you have power law that starts really really uh leveling out so like we did 22 deals over the last two and a half years and four of those deals are the ones that are 90% of the returns that we have and there's so many the deals that we did where I'm like man that was it's lit truly just a complete waste of my time like waste of money waste of time because I can get so much more taking
(12:07) the the the largeest company of the portfolio is about $100 million a year if I can get that that going from 100 to 150 million is actually the same level of work sometimes easier than going from Z to 1 million or 1 to 10 million like and it's it's 50 million in absolute and you also get a premium on the eida meaning the the the take-home I'll say that in quotes for the business is that it's the reverse of of uh of of buying where you get economies of scale where you you lower the price when you get bigger with with businesses you get a you get a scale premium you get paid
(12:40) more for the profit that you get when the profit isn't absolutely bigger and so you get more more it's easier to grow than bigger and you get more for the growth you get and so this is where like getting more for the effort that you put in becomes really important and I didn't know that when I got into the business and so for each of these businesses I've had these big learning cores where it's like okay this is what I think that businesses is about and then you get into it and you're like oh this is what the business is really about this is the big hairy problem that I really have to
(13:05) solve and so the thing is is that at least I had the day yesterday um where I talked to these business owners and it became clear for a handful of them that they were plateaued because they actually didn't know what business they were in they were kind of like that gym owner who got into the cleaning he was like man this is this is tough because he kept looking at marketing and sales being like what am I what do I need to do differently here when the reality was the constraint of the business was actually a different big hairy problem and the good news for us as
(13:27) entrepreneurs is that we get paid to solve that problem we get paid very well to solve that problem and so what's interesting is that a lot of entrepreneurs will restart the cycle over and over and over again because they say so using that cleaning gym owner example he might say okay now if we hadn't had that conversation he might start yet another business where he can market and sell because he learned how to solve those problems so he knows how to beat the level one and the level two boss but as soon as he coms the level
(13:53) three boss which is a completely different skill set they needed to have he just stops and starts another opportunity and so this is what is so deceptive about the woman in the red dress is that the when I say if you're new to my stuff the woman in the red dress is the is the distraction it's the shiny object it's the it's the opportunity that looks more appealing with the current skill set you have you said it's that she she Whispers to you and she says listen you're marketing and selling over there if you just had the same skill set with me it'd be better
(14:19) it'd be so much better but it's it's false because what she doesn't tell you is that she's absolutely [ __ ] crazy in all these other ways that you didn't know about and then when you get in bed whether you're like oh my God she has six personalities I this is crazy right and so the thing is is that um that is what most opportunities look like you have uninformed optimism because you think this is the business that you're getting into and then you get into bed with that business and you realize this is the real business she actually has a baby daddy and she's got a kid she didn't tell you about and you're like oh
(14:44) I did not sign up for this but now you got a host of problems you got to solve and you got to decide whether they're the types of problems you want to solve and so um this is why so many entrepreneurs start and keep starting businesses and starting over and they get to the same size and then they just move move over to another woman in the red dress who promises a different outcome with the same skills they have and they get to the same level they get the same level of Revenue because they don't know how to break past it because
(15:07) they don't know the actual business they're in hey and if you're wondering where do I get these stories or like how could I be one of the businesses that's in the room getting kind of this like more personalized attention we just started a new division at acquisition. comom uh for workshops for business owners that are over a certain amount and so if you want to see if you qualify you go to acquisition.
(15:29) comom click through the steps and uh maybe we'll see you in Vegas and so they keep beating the same bosses because they're comfortable there and so what happens is in the beginning you don't make any money you learn how to beat one boss you start making money and you're like oh let me see if I can beat that boss over and over again at the in different businesses and that's how I'm going to grow but it's not that you have to beat a new boss every time and the hard work is figuring out the hairier the the hairy problem in front of you and it's usually the thing that we don't want to confront because sometimes it makes us feel bad about ourselves sometimes we're
(15:53) like well maybe my product just isn't that good oh wow I have to learn coding oh I have to bring technical talent in well I've never done that before well guess what that's how it that's what you got to do if you want to make this thing go big and so what's interesting about this and this is my like kind of like word of encouragement for for whatever business you're in is that the reality is that almost any business can be taken to a billion dollars with a long enough time Horizon this is truth almost any business can
(16:15) get to a billion dollars in terms of value with a long enough time Horizon so you're in the roofing space you can get to a billion dollar roofing company you have a restaurant there's a version of a restaurant business that is a billion dollars it's not a single location but it could either be a franchise of business or you could you could have privately held I mean there's there's a bunch of you know big high-end change you look at mastas you look at some of these companies they're several hundred million dollar companies and so you look at dry cleaning like you look at Zips
(16:40) like it's a massive you know uh uh at least domestic in the US um chain of dry cleaning things so like there are versions of every business that make hundreds of Millions worth billions of dollars it's just that it takes a very long time to get there and you have to beat new bosses at every level and what happens is most people get distracted because they don't know the business they're in they encounter a problem they think it's the opportunity vehicle they think they need to switch women they think they need to go after the the red dress but the reality is that like you
(17:09) just have to have that hard conversation with your wife or your girlfriend or whoever you're with right now to see if we can get to the next level and so if you solve the right problems and this is how I think about this I imagine that I've got this big concrete wall in front this is my imagery for myself that gets me through this because it is it sucks right you have these these moments where you're like okay I just realized that I'm now in the recruiting and training business for cleaning and I'm not equipped for this this is not what I this is not what I signed up for I didn't know she had a kid I didn't know
(17:41) that she has a baby daddy that's in jail and he comes he's coming out in six weeks I didn't know these things were there now using that example you might just dip but let's let's imagine a world where you had to stick with it right and so I imagine that I've got this big Harry Pot this big wall of concrete in front of me but what I do is and I had this convers ation with one of our portfolio CEOs I was like hey we have to build this new product line out and he was like I don't know how to do that and I was like well
(18:05) here's the good news once we do it I was like it'll increase the Enterprise value of this business by $200 million and I was like is that worth it and he was like well when you say it like that he's like I mean I definitely feel a lot more encouraged to solve the problem I was like right now I don't think it's 200 million hard I was like this might be 10 million hard but that's a great trade if if this is 10 million hard to get 200 million in Enterprise Value that's a [ __ ] steal and so I try to think like that is like okay I've got this big concrete wall in front of me and the thing is is that when you've got a you got a sledgehammer and you
(18:34) just don't know how thick the wall is and so it's like how many times I'm going to have to keep Hammer I know that there's 200 million on the other side I just don't know how far I got to go and I think that's one of the difficulties in entrepreneurship is the uncertainty that's attached to the level and duration and intensity of the amount of work that you have to persist and continue to do without seeing the light at the end of the tunnel without having a crack in the wall that you see a little nugget a little Shimmer of gold a
(18:58) little diamond that starts to peek through the corner like you have to keep swinging at the wall and so I I think about this as as making sure that I'm simply making progress and so there are I didn't think I was going to get into this but I'm going to go into it so there's two very different types of hard in business and there's the good kind of hard and there's the bad kind of hard so the good kind of hard as I see it is that you have you have underlying assumptions that you believe to be true from a first principal's level so I'll give you an example so let's say I want
(19:28) to get I want to start running uh Tik Tok ads for one of our companies we don't have Tik Tok ads going uh in that particular business and we think that fundamentally so this is the principal perspective are there let's say accountants on Tik Tok yes I think there are accountants on Tik Tok okay is there a way that we can run ads profitably and get our messaging in front of those people on Tik Tok if the answer is yes then I fundamentally believe that there's a profitable way that we can turn those eyeballs into customers period now if we start running ads on Tik Tok and then we don't immediately
(19:59) Roi that's the good kind of hard that's the okay well let's start at the beginning how did we get did we get enough clicks okay yes we got clicks all right do we get optins yes we got optins okay of the optins that we got are they the right type of people yes they're the right type of people or no they're not the right type people okay well then maybe we need to change the messaging maybe we need to change the targeting maybe we change the lead mag but these are the iterative types of heart this in my opinion is a good type of heart I
(20:23) don't see me losing money on the ads as quote losing money I see that as me investing in something that's going to increase the Enterprise value of my company because I'm going to get another acquisition Channel I'm going to diversify how I get customers to me that's a great return it's actually one of those underutilized ways of thinking about this it's like okay if I have a company that has one way of getting customers and I can get a second way of getting customers and I diversify risk in terms of my client acquisition that
(20:46) meaningfully increases the Enterprise Value even if I had no additional EB even if I had no more profit from doing this now obviously if you have another acquisition Channel and you get 50% of your business from that channel then it means you've double the business as long as you don't lose the first acquisition Channel and and so by doing that I get two multipliers on Enterprise Value one is I absolutely make twice as much money which is great but I also decrease the risk associated with the purchase for an acquirer which means that I will also
(21:09) make more money on the exit and so wow okay well if I do this again what's the price tag that I get to ascribe to this problem well if I can double let's say the E of the business is 2 million bucks and it's trading at 5x okay fine so this is a$ million doll business if I can add two and I diversify acquisition streams then that might add minimum 10 million in Enterprise Value but realistically maybe $15 million in Enterprise Value by having this one acquisition system and so if I lose a hundred grand trying to figure out how to run ads profitably on
(21:41) Tik Tok and it takes me six months if I reframe the question as hey will you invest $100,000 and wait six months for a $10 million return would I do it [ __ ] yeah I would do it but people don't think that way they get they get butt hurt because they're like oh my eyes didn't work I don't think Tik Tok works for us I don't think Tik I don't think marketing works I don't think pay ads work for us come on get out of here you so fundamentally it's saying I don't think that if I get on the phone with accountants and we sell accounting stuff that will make money it's Preposterous it's ridiculous but people are [ __ ]
(22:12) and that's why they don't make money okay so big big big big picture here right is that we get solved and sorry we get paid to solve big problems and the bigger the problem the bigger the payoff and so I like to ascribe one how much Enterprise Value am I going to get on the other side of this concrete wall and that helps pull me through the fact that I'm going to have to swing this hammer and I don't how many times I'm going to have to swing it and as long as I'm solving the right kind of problem which is a type of problem that I can reason to First principles of the idea of yes people who buy my stuff are on
(22:48) this platform and there is a way to reach them and I can do so profitably then we will make money now you're like well what's the what's the bad type of problem what's the bad type of heart so this is a classic problem of do I push or do I pivot and this is a classic you know entrepreneur dilemma that we have right and so I have pivoted a number of times in my career and I've pushed a hell of a lot more but I pivot when my underlying assumptions are proven Incorrect and so it's like if we believe this to be true then this is true and if this is true then this is true so if for
(23:19) example a report came out from Tik Tok and they said we have banned accountants because we don't want Financial people on our platform then I would say no we don't push here like fundamentally the assumption that we based all of these actions on is not true and so we pivot and so I like to use that as a very clear litmus test of when am I being a [ __ ] or when am I being intelligent and so if I say before we make this big investment these are the assumptions that we believe to be true and based on these assumptions we will continue to persist we will continue to iterate until we get what we want if one of
(23:55) those assumptions is proven wrong and we have data to support that it's not true then we will change our course of action and I will lose whatever investment I had there but I don't even see that as losing I see that as learning and we invested to learn data that no one else knows because if someone else knew it well they might have had to pay to learn it too great and I mean fundamentally that's the ignorant tax of business that we all have to pay for so let me give you a real example of a lady who I talked to yesterday who I actually said
(24:21) I think you should pivot which is tough for me because I I'm I'm always going to be the like how hard can we push is there a way that we can we can get through this but uh it became clear talking to her and I'll give you the scenario so you can understand the difference so she was uh a lady who um had a had a CO a canned cocktail business so she had premium cocktails they were in cans now you're like okay that's a little bit contradictory but okay so and the cocktails were 5% ABV so they weren't cocktail strength but so
(24:48) there's basically like Premium Fruit juices now she wouldn't say this this is me saying this Premium Fruit juices with you know organic ingredients and all that stuff that were priced premium without a premium brand but premium ingredients um and she was having trouble uh selling them now she was I think she was doing you know a million and a half a year and she had a thousand different distribution channels like a literal as in like thousand different stores were carrying it and if you're like wait a
(25:11) thousand stores 1.5 million a year yes the cell through rate was very low which means he was able to just basically front inventory to the people and they're not really moving it and so when I hear that when I heard that I was like okay well what experience do you have in this world at all and she had sold a gister early but for not a lot of money and I was like okay well that's kind of related um and then she was like well I've got Amazon going I've got a Shopify store I have B2B wholesale and I have she had all these different lines of business and I was like well and she
(25:42) just let all of her staff go so it's just her and it made zero profit and she was asking me like what should I do and so in and this was tough for me because basically I like to think about what's the hypothetical extreme version of this business what is the what is the maxim version of this business and so I saw two different paths here for her uh path one was you and she said I want to build a billion dollar thing and I was like all right well I mean if you want to build a billion dollar thing like that's going to be tough because you have no money and so you have a thousand
(26:17) distribution channels and so what we have to do is either a you somehow get a lot of money and get a premium brand sponsorship you get somebody who can make the association with you and then you use that brand sponsorship you use the rock Logan Paul whatever to leverage into these Master distribution bases and that person promotes it so that people buy in person now she was RTD meaning is ready to drink and so shipping costs made direct to Consumer for me not really a viable option it's too expensive now are there ways you can do
(26:45) it yes she was listed on Amazon it didn't make a lot of money there but it was there now the core thing that I asked her and by the way if you're in this business this is the core problem that you have to solve is that I said what percentage of people who drink your drink for the first time buy it again and she didn't have that metric if there's ever a [ __ ] important metric in a business for Consumer packaged Goods is what percentage of people who who try the thing do it again and I then mind you this is of Ideal customers not
(27:10) everybody so if you have a kid's chocolate and you give it to old people then they're probably not going to want to buy it again but of the ideal Avatar of the ideal customer base that you have what percentage of those people buy again and she didn't even have that metric it's like well this is going to be really tough now she'd never run Rec response before so I was like I know there's no way that she's going to be able to to do media she does like advertising I was like there's no way you're going to win build a billion dollar brand when you really have to be in the traffic business for cocktails if
(27:35) you're going to direct go to direct a consumer now if she was like I'm a dollar saave Club Advertiser then I'd be like maybe there's a way she could figure something like this out but that wasn't her skill set and so I was like okay well you could do this big she you knew how to get into distribution bases that was her skill because she had The Distillery so that was the one thing she brought to the table but she didn't understand branding at all and she didn't know if the product was good because people didn't keep drinking it so now what she doesn't have any money
(27:59) so either she'd have to raise a ton of money which I didn't think made a lot of sense at the level that she was at or the recommendation that I had is I said listen you're in the UK Market you need to go from a thousand distribution places to shrinking all the way down to Regional and you need to go on foot and talk to each of the local uh sellers that sell your product at their liquor stores or out their you know convenience stores and you need to stand there and Sample and Sample and Sample and Sample and tell your story and when you do that
(28:31) you'll make money people will buy the product just from you being there that that's profitable on a day-to-day basis but hopefully you do that a couple times a week at each store a couple times a week at each store and then all of a sudden the salespeople hear you saying it and then you make sure that they get Comm commissions when they sell your product and then all of a sudden they start moving it for you now all of this relies on the thing actually being good that if people drink it they come back and buy it again because the salesman can always move the first can and they're only going to really do it if
(28:55) they think it's good and so because they don't want to sacrifice their relational Capital with people that are regulars inside the store like oh hey Sarah what what are you buying this week I don't know we just got this new got this new cocktail thing you should give it a shot it's pretty good whatever and so these were the core pieces of which I believe that she would have to do if she wanted to make this successful now I said now to be clear in order for this to work one this thing has to be exceptional in terms of the The Taste and people have to keep buying it first core principle
(29:21) that has to be true because Tak it to its absolute extreme all the marketing branding in the world you're simply going to tell everybody you have a mediocre product they'll never buy it again and so Jesse Ito tells a story that I like a lot he had this product called sheets it was a caffeinated like Listerine strip and he partnered with LeBron so he had premium brand Like Jesse gets it premium brand big traffic big distribution he already had the connections with distribution and he said they started cranking sales first week second week more sales third week
(29:46) even more sales fourth week even more sales he's like this thing's going to be a billion dollar brand in two years this is going be unbelievable fifth week sales go down sixth week sales go even lower seventh week sales go even lower why why and he says this he's like the product just wasn't good enough and so if you're an expert marketer expert brander with consumer package grids you can absolutely get that big boom if you do it right and she didn't have that skill yet and he had money and celebrity
(30:10) endorsements she had neither of those things but I wasn't even confident that the product was good enough if the product was it would still keep growing at a slower Pace but it would still keep growing every month because people would come back to buy it so for her I said you have to compress this all the way down and then this might take 10 to 15 years and if you're willing to do that and she'd come into this being like this is the market trends blah blah blah blah blah but what I didn't sense was what I call a missionary heart now there's mercenaries who are like look at the
(30:39) Arbitrage look at the charts look at like this is the opportunity that I could I could tap into it's like yeah but no one's buying your stuff and if she had said there's a hole in my heart and I want this drink to be in the world because it changed my life then I'd be like awesome then like let's make it happen and you got and you're going to be willing to P 15 years because it's it's your soul it's your it's your passion it's something that you feel like you're on this Earth to do I didn't get that vibe from her and so seeing that she wanted to have this big billion
(31:03) dollar thing and seeing that she didn't have the heart for it and knowing that the Big Brand play was probably off the table because she didn't have the money for it I told her I said okay I'll give you one Hail Mary and if this Hail Mary doesn't work you shut down the business and you move on and so the Hail Mary was the can size was small and it fit well for airport uh airport people you know like the airport she says airplane stus and train and bus people they have these carts with little short trays and so she's like I'm in talks with them and they're very interested because the size is actually right for them and so I said okay well
(31:42) if you can go close a cruise liner that has 90 cruise ships and you can make them your distribution maybe you're selling to the wrong Market maybe instead of selling to brick-and mortar uh Distributors you actually just need to go to Transportation based businesses and then that's your Niche and the thing is is there you only have to out compete like two or three other people because it's super narrow now they're going to have very strict requirements of the can size the weight the packaging the labeling the price points which is going to be a problem for her because she's premium and no one
(32:11) cares but if you sell into that and I said go there big borrow and steel and do whatever you can to get that contract if you can't close one of these big contracts that'll give you the cash FL then to expand from there and that you can leverage like hey I just gotten a carnival hey Royal Cruise Line do you guys want to get it too because you can leverage that one sale that gives you all the credibility to get the rest of your meetings but if you can't close that deal for me I said I think you should pivot because
(32:33) I didn't think if I were betting I wouldn't have bet on the business and I try to serve the entrepreneur above everything else and given the skills that she had coming into it that wouldn't have been the bet that I would have taken and so I say I say that as the counter example of there were fundamentals that would have to be true in order for her to win here she would have to have a lot of money to do the Big Brand deal and have distribution she would have to be super passionate and have a 10 to 15 year time rizon to make the regional super small play Work hand
(33:01) toand combat she would have to have that she didn't have either of those things and so the only real viable path that required no money that had the existing skill set she had was go to Transportation distribution and use the fact that she had this kind of unique aspect of the size of the cans and have that be the selling point and hope to God that that actually works because if that didn't work she would run out of money before anything else would happen and then she would be forced to change the business and I would rather her
(33:26) learn that quickly than waste another three years not making progress on potentially a different business that would be better suited for her skill set and what made this particular woman really interesting is I said like how do you live cuz I I asked pretty Point Blank questions I was like how you know she looked like she had nice clothing she looked she like she lived nicely and so she said she sold a gym business so I said Jin as in like alcohol not gy um and she and she said oh that I actually didn't make a ton of money on that sale and I was like well where does your money come from and she said oh property
(33:55) development and I was like wait what and she's like yeah I develop pen houses and I was like wait so you have this cocktail business but you also have this property development business she like oh well I've been doing that my whole life it's just on the side it kind of runs itself it's very easy and I was like okay so let me tell you a little lesson that I've learned in my life for being an entrepreneur when money comes easy I go hard when money comes hard I go easy and so so many of the businesses I have are are half steps where it's like
(34:24) I thought I was going to get here and then boom this flow of cash opens up I was like oh maybe this is the business that I should be getting into like gym launch started by accident I was doing turnarounds flying out doing done for you sales and only because I was like Hey I'm going to shift my business over to just selling direct to consumer that I said hey I'll sell the licensing of all the stuff that I used to use that I made more money in a month that I ever made in my life and I was like whoa maybe this is the business I'm in and
(34:49) there's so many happy coincidence there was another business owner that was there that had an agency uh business and so many of his customers needed financing because he had a really high-end thing and so he was selling like you know $50,000 like very done for you you know TurnKey website build outs ads you know whatever and he realized that he was so good at getting people financing that he was making more money on the financing than he was on the actual agency services and so he stopped doing agency services and just got into debt financing for businesses so he just
(35:17) got into credit loans and sorry business lines and and uh and getting business debt and so like it's amazing how these things how these stories come to be it's like you just got to have the nose for the money and so she was here saying that she had a prop and I was like so hold on you've made all the money in your life from property development and you basically play business on the side so you you you easily in a couple hours a week make more money than you make with all your hours a week on this other
(35:42) business she was like yeah I was like well then why don't you just do all of your time on the thing that makes you the most money and she said I swear to God this is what she said she said that business isn't scalable and I was like okay I want you to say that to me again really slowly property development isn't scalable I was like so you're telling me that developing real estate is not a scalable business I was like do you know how many billionaires and 100 Millionaires and decamillionaires made all their money
(36:13) developing property it's literally the most scalable business you add zeros and you develop a bigger property that is how you do it that is how you scale it now you're going to have to hire employees but guess what you already know how to do it whereas in the other business that you're in you don't know anything about the business this business you've been doing your whole life and so you already know how you negotiate these these loans how you how you negotiate the properties and What markets you look after and where you see
(36:35) the Arbitrage and how you do the redecorations and who your interior designers are you already have all the connections you just need to hire people and so the real problem was that she just didn't know how to manage people she didn't know how to train people and That Was Then the real problem that honestly spread across all the businesses that she was trying to deal with but we tell ourselves these stories and it's so interesting the the stories that limit us because anybody from the outside would be like wait a second so
(36:57) you make all this money really easily on this thing that has clear scale that is a tried and true business that has existed for thousands of years real estate or you have this thing that you have to have tons of capital you have no experience in you don't know Market you don't know how to advertise you don't know how to Brand you don't know media and you don't want to go face to face hand to hand and do knock on a 100 doors and do that well maybe we do more of the thing that you're really good at that you have all the experience of and then we confront the problem that you didn't want to confront the big hairy thing
(37:29) which was she didn't know how to scale that business I said so what I want you to do instead of saying this isn't scalable I want you to say I don't know how to scale this and then that becomes a problem that you can solve it's the same as saying there's no salespeople who sell like me no you don't know how to get salese to sell like you there's no marketing doesn't work for my business no I don't know how to make marketing work for my business you go from it being a circumstance Universe problem to something that you can
(37:57) control and you take the sledgehammer you confront the big concrete wall you realize the payout that you have on the other side and you ask yourself if I had a business that was a property development business and I could scale it how much would that be worth to me and am I willing to do the work to get it and if the answer is yes then you get to work and so if we look at this entrepreneur the cocktail lady who had the property development business she actually was in the right business in her property development and rather than push she pivoted she got seduced by the
(38:28) woman in the red dress she got seduced by lady who said hey your skill set would be so much cooler over here you'd be able to build a billion dooll thing faster over here but she could and probably needed to Simply push through the existing business that had fundamental truths that you could not you can't disprove like when someone whenever someone says this business isn't scalable you have to break it down to physics tell me why physically it's impossible to scale property development is there not enough property to develop why why is it not scalable because PE
(39:01) entrepreneurs throw this thing all all the time they're like that business isn't scalable why it just means you don't know how to scale it or it's difficult to scale well guess what there's also a big payoff for once you solve it and so usually people progress through the easier problems they know how to solve and then they stop when it's a problem they've never seen before and then they try and come up with all sorts of crazy ideas that justify why they shouldn't keep pursuing or why they shouldn't keep failing and and when I
(39:26) say failing I mean trial and failing trial and erroring they they don't want to keep erroring on the thing they're in and they just want to feel like they win again and that's why they move they move because they know how to win in this other thing and so they they go for the quick win rather than the long win which is you get through getting punch in the face over and over again and sledging your way through the wall that you don't know how thick it is and for that specific entrepreneur because I did talk to you and you might listen to this if
(39:51) you really believe in this cocktail thing then you got to go go For Broke on this contract that you get for the transportation like there is it's a zero fail situation like if you want to make this business work that is your zero fail situation it's the only thing that's going to get you a lot of money for no Capital down that'll get you immediate distribution despite the fact that you don't have a good like a big good brand if you can just do that that becomes your Niche and then you try and own as much of that market as humanly possible if you can't or you don't succeed this is where the heart is we're
(40:22) like if you heart if you really wanted this thing to come to life then you would go back and You' start start working local and you'd go store to store and you'd say I'm going to commit the next 15 years to this and that's if the product is good enough if it's not good enough and people don't keep buying it all of this will be for nothing truly like it will be for nothing because fundamentally the product has to be good enough that people want to buy it again otherwise you spend all the money to a Car customer they drink it once there's no LTV in consumer package Goods unless people get rep purchases that's it it
(40:51) has to get repe purchases without you telling them to buy it and so if that's the the big principle like what's the foundational principle that we Prov to be untrue you'd either have to change the product or change the business

Transcript:
(00:00) This is Ben. He's a cocktail consultant who helps restaurants and bars optimize their drink menus to increase profits. But his revenue is unstable. Sometimes he has a great month and then other times he sells nothing and sometimes that goes down. I'm Alexi. I own acquisition.com or portfolio of companies that generate hundreds of millions of dollars per year in revenue.
(00:18) What I suspect Ben needs to work on is optimizing his funnel, fixing his offer. He's trying to sell a $30,000 thing to strangers who've never even worked with him before, which is pretty tough. And then once that all that stuff's fixed, spending more on his actual marketing. So, the first thing I'm going to do is dive deep into the business and then I'm going to break down all the tactics that he and you can use to scale your business to your dreams. Hey, Alex. I'm Ben. Hello. One of the co-founders of Unfiltered Hospitality, where we help
(00:41) hospitality operators build better beverage programs. Tell me about the business. So, we are bar and beverage program development specialists. In 2024, we did 1.1 million in revenue, 123,000 in net profit, so about 11.3% in uh net margins.
(01:03) We've been in business for about 4 and 1/2 years, but we've helped over 200 bars launch or elevate their concepts. So, what's the goal? What do you want to do? My goal, 3 million by the end of 2020. It's big goals. Yeah. Triple this year. All right. Yeah. Triple this year. Rock and roll. So, how did you get started? Uh, in 2008, I started my life in the world as an investment banker. Okay. And so, I hated it. Quit my job there.
(01:23) Over the next 7 years, I worked in bars and restaurants around the city. A few years after that, I opened my first bar. It was all going really well until 2020. Okay. We all remember what happened then. Uh it was just like this small pandemic. It's over now, so we're good. That's good. Yeah.
(01:40) Fortunately, I got approached by a restaurant that was still operational and they said, "We need new cocktails." I said, "Great. I'm very good at that." So, I tapped my business partner, Ghee, and so we started Unfiltered Hospitality. All right. Yeah. So, who do you help? We currently work with restaurants, hotels, bars, country clubs, cruise ships, nightclubs. If they have a bar, we help them.
(01:59) How do you help them? We help them by taking their bar programs from good to great. Phase one, which we call better cocktail consulting, takes 90 days. We design a cocktail menu for them. We train their teams and then we install an operating system to keep it all running smoothly. Phase one is better cocktail consulting. Phase two. Phase two is what we call the program performance retainer.
(02:22) Okay, so the point of this is to maintain what we did with Better [ __ ] Consulting and then continue to develop the program and we do that by having a weekly KPI call where we check the scorecard to see how well your metrics are doing. We also then provide seasonal monthly seasonal cocktails. We want to maintain the training and so we have a quarterly training program where we fly out there and we significant train the team for two days. You don't mind flying? That's good cuz I have an idea for you.
(02:46) So, I have an inkling that Ben needs to go up market. Restaurants that make over a certain amount of money, they're going to think about like a business, not just like their passion project. Passion project business owners are kind of tough to deal with when you come from a business perspective.
(02:58) They're not willing to make like sometimes really obvious, clear, good business decisions for whatever limiting belief they have. Okay, so that's how you help them. Um, how do you make money? Great. Our core offer, which is what most people buy from us, is better cocktail consulting. We charge 30,000 for that. And again, that's just the development and implementation.
(03:15) And what we love to do is upsell everybody or at least have them initially buy the better beverage program, which is what we call better cocktail consulting plus multiple program performance retainers. Okay. What percentage of people go from the core offer to the upsell? Less than less than 20%. Ding, ding, ding. So, my little alarm went off.
(03:33) When I hear, you know, barely 20%, that's an indication for me that there's probably an offer issue on the back end, maybe even the front end or a combination of the both of how they work together. So, what's the main problem? What's holding you back? We need more better bees, right? Yesterday. Yeah. Yeah. Long time ago. Yeah. Yeah.
(03:52) Higher quality, higher quantity, more more consistency because it's like too too much variability, lower cost, right? So, the lack of consistency really feels awful. I don't know what next month is going to be. Is it going to be a good month or a bad month? The good months are pretty good, but I can't really fully enjoy them because the bad months are so awful.
(04:08) Because the way that we're doing sales now is we will go for days, sometimes weeks without any leads at all. And finally, when we do get a lead, we'll get them on the phone, we'll have the calls, we'll pitch them, they'll get excited, will get excited, and we get to the end, we present the price, and deal is dead.
(04:30) So, if you can imagine that massive drought followed by a huge disappointment, I'm really looking forward to getting rid of that. A $12,000 uh CAC is crazy, especially considering the LTV. Ding, ding, ding. Number two, we have a super expensive cost to acquire a customer. And this is a customer that should probably be 1,500 bucks, $2,500 bucks, maybe $3,500 to acquire.
(04:47) So, there's definitely an offer mismatch between what is being advertised and what they're selling if CAC is so high or they just have atrocious sales processes. So, it's either an offer, sales process issue, or both. And we're going to figure it out. What we've noticed that our our best clients are existing restaurants, right? And so we're considering refining our targeting down to just serving restaurants that are currently operational making $4 million a year or more in revenue. What could you sell for like $8 to $10,000? Something that we've
(05:16) tried in the past and could easily bring it back is essentially a DIY like we'll teach you how to do it. Mhm. The uptake on that is what I would assume lower. People have a hard time like doing things if they're already not doing things.
(05:33) I would think, is there a different thing that could be sold that was still in that price point that wasn't DIY? I mean, basically, I wouldn't position it as DIY. I would just be like, we're not going to fly out. The good news is I think this is super fixable. Let's do the the quick recap of all the numbers you got so far. 2024 revenue 1.1 million, profit 123,000, our CAC 11,800, very high LTV to CAC of 1.7 to1.
(05:54) Our marketing spend without salaries is $10,000 a month. Close rate 66. So come here real quick. Check this out. This is the $100 million scaling road map. Ben is at stage four, prioritize. And let me know if this sounds familiar. He's saying yes to anyone who would pay. He's got all these different types of avatars. He's getting way too many unqualified leads.
(06:12) But he's getting people who are clicking. He's getting people opting in, but they're not the right types of people. Here's his next problem. The result of all this stuff is that he's got to specialize his product. He's got to make better free stuff and have better creative to boost the volume and add qualifications and friction.
(06:30) Sounding familiar? And so the thing is is that as much as it always feels like this unknown journey when you're a business owner, businesses behave in patterns. We broke out after studying our portfolio companies, seeing where they got stuck and how we broke through and put into 10 stages. If you're curious about where you're at, this is absolutely free. Just go to acquisition.
(06:47) com/roadmap, plug in your business information and our automation thingy will tell you what stage you're at and what you need to do to get to the next level. So, it's absolutely free. Go check that out.
(07:00) And if you want our team to like double checkck the work and make sure that it's the right one and give you more tactics around it, you can hop on a call on the next page and we'd love to help you out. The nice thing is that like I feel very confident that your business will will will grow because there's some really obvious holes. I think I honestly have what I need. Why don't you come on this side and then we'll probably we'll pow through it together. Does that work? Yeah, that sounds great.
(07:18) Uh, but before we get started, would you mind if I uh made you a cocktail? Ah, all right. I I'll be saucy for our for our No, don't don't worry, Alex. I took care of that. Uh, we actually have a non grand slam offer cocktail. Uh, which is really fantastic, very refreshing, really great for making sure that uh you we we both stay sharp and focused during the rest of our time together. Um, but it's a delicious cocktail.
(07:42) As you noticed, the grand slam offer. I took a page out of your book, literally. Consists of a few great ingredients that are really going to help us stay like on task. So, we have grapefruit juice, fresh grapefruit juice. Squeezed it myself this morning.
(07:59) A ginger mint cordial to give it a little spice and a little herbaceiousness. And then we have our pineapple kombucha. I know way more people's drinks than their actual names. Grand Slam offered. Pam. Mind if I bring it over? Yeah, by all means. Let's do it. Thank you. All right. Here you go. Oh, I get I got a full experience. There we go. All right, man. Enjoy. Thank you.
(08:20) Cheers. Cheers. Oh, that's great. Awesome. I can definitely see how the kombucha would take off the edge of the of like it could hide a a spirit really easily with that. Oh, yeah. Okay. So, there's a lot of things.
(08:37) So, I think that we need to actually talk about the offer, which is something that I don't always get the opportunity to talk about, but I think that you have a clear offer issue. I think we need to talk about avatar. That'll be as it relates to the offer. Number three, and this is going to be a big one, is going to be the funnel.
(08:49) There's a lot of stuff that like a lot of missing things there that I think we can like really quickly fix. And then sales. And then finally, maybe uh ascension. And so that's kind of the big the big overarching theme. Sure. So, right off the bat, I think that you have an offer issue.
(09:08) So, either that means that we're getting the wrong avatars on the phone or we're getting the right avatars on the phone or we're offering the wrong thing. Okay, so I would say $30,000 is super expensive for just a straight literally just a straight call funnel. Very tough. So when Alex said I had an offer problem, I had a strong feeling he was right because 4 and 1/2 years into the business, if we're struggling the way we're struggling, there's got to be something broken. And if he Alex says it's the offer, it's a good chance it's the offer.
(09:34) for what you're looking at CAC for a small business owner restaurant I would imagine should probably be in the neighborhood of $1,500 $2,500. Okay, that's where that's like if you were up at 3 $3500 be like okay fine but it's going to be in that kind of range. And so I think there's a you can probably cut it by at least 2/3 compared to the you know 12,000 or whatever that you're spending right now. So I think there's there's a lot of opportunity from that perspective. God, there's there's so much stuff.
(09:58) Like, um, I'm just trying to think, okay, why don't we just start tip of the spear and let's open up the ads, uh, since that's the one that we can control the most. So, right off the bat, we need to have clear call outs. So, we need to be talking about what avatar are we really looking for. So, struggling to get the most out of your cocktail program.
(10:14) I don't know if that's necessarily even the language that would matter. I also wouldn't restate my name on one for infiltrate hospitality because we already have it above there. So, it's like it's it's it's some of the most valuable uh advertising real estate. Yeah. And so I would probably have something to the degree of like restaurant owners asterric asterric, you know what I mean? And then like second line like is your like are you doing over you know x million per year or it could just be $4 million plus per year uh restaurant owners is call out number
(10:39) one. And then the question would be pain based hook. All right. So check this out. So I'm on page 136 of the leads book. The first part I'm talking about here is the call out. So we have to get the right people to notice the ad and it is by far the most important. And so I'm trying to compress the things that he's looking for in his ideal avatar into just one line.
(10:58) So they're like, "Oh, I'm a $4 million plus per year restaurant owner or bar owner. Just put it there and then like this is for me." And once I do that, 80% of the work of advertising is actually done. As crazy as that sounds, what I'm getting into further after that is, okay, let's see if we can ask a yes question or an if then statement uh or talk about some ridiculous result.
(11:19) All of these things are kind of the line after actually calling out the prospect. Right? Now, once we get a little further into the copy, I like using the what, who, when framework. So, this takes the uh value equation, which I talk about in my first book, this guy, and tries to like explode this into many different copy variations.
(11:38) And so, what we want to talk about is both the dream stuff, which is what's the good outcome, how do we make it fast, how to make it likely, how to make it easy, and then on the flip side, the pain, which is what's your nightmare scenario. And so this gives you a lot of different angles to approach the copy for a customer whether it's a BTOC customer or a B2B business owner. And the reason I'm such a big proponent of pain in advertising is one is it's super compliant.
(11:57) Two I have the belief that the more precisely you can articulate the pain of a prospect to that prospect and even describe it more accurately to themselves than they can articulate it. they will believe that you can help them almost better than any promise that you can make them. So, if you're like, "Hey, did Sally say this yesterday? Did you have this problem that showed up?" And are you consistently running out of your most expensive ingredients? But then sometimes they go bad. All of a sudden, like, God, this guy knows exactly where
(12:27) I'm at and now I'm far more likely to take the next step. Has cocktails been less than 10% of your revenue year-over-year? Something like that, right? or cuz I know you said in the messaging they they're not as receptive to like profit money related stuff.
(12:44) There are there are avatars that do like profit but a lot of them like recognition and being cool. Yeah. And being cool, right? Yeah. They want to be cool and they want to be like popular like they want to be able to show off. So people have different histories of reinforcement, meaning they've had good things that happened in the past from different things that they've done.
(13:00) And so if somebody did really well in school, they like, you know, getting A's and maybe the the score matters more for them. Other people it's like they like the applause. Other people it's like they like showing up and having people flock to them. Like everyone has different drivers. We want to describe what it's like the experience of success in as many varied ways as possible to attract the most varied avatars as long as they meet our requisites.
(13:26) Like is your cocktail program flaccid? Would probably do great. Has no one ever posted anything good about your your cocktails in the last 2 years? If you look at your reviews on Yelp, have do you just have Long Island iced teas and you know vodka sodas, right? Like you might need a insert, you know, a bar rehaul instead of saying cuz what this is is super feature heavy data driven menus designed to get more orders team training that delivers because all that sounds like work. Yeah. For me. Sure.
(13:49) And so what I want is what occurs as a result, right? And so I would be talking more about like client C typically 10 10x their investment the first year, 30% increase in menu orders. I'm not sure if it like bites at me, you know what I mean? And so it would be more like what the experience is like from people just ordering the things that they know off the top of their mind to getting excited when they open up your menu and then all of a sudden saying oh man I want to try so many of these and then ordering two or three times more. So it's like dial
(14:14) into the experience of what the avatar is going to go through and then I would translate it okay what about the restaurant owner having you know your restaurant featured in some of these types of magazines which honestly doesn't take as long as you think as soon as you make these types of changes. You know what a lot of restaurant owners don't know is that one of the largest profit drivers in the business is is alcohol.
(14:33) And it's the one thing that they're the least focused on. If you want, you can book a call, but even if you don't, what I did was I took the, you know, the top 10 worst drinks to serve, and I'll show you how to replace them with the top with 10 drinks that are better than that that work for just about any bar.
(14:50) Now, on the thank you page, so you can download that on the next page, but on the thank you page, if you want us to personalize it to your bar concept, we'll show you uh how to organize the bar so you can get way more drinks served. you can do it with higher margins and you don't have to train people for nearly as long because if you set it out the right way if that's interesting book call next page right and so that would be more or less my ad right at least my ad structure and so the the big thing number one is that a is that we need better ads y so that's going to be both the copy so we want call outs to avatar we want to have pain
(15:16) based hooks we want to be more benefit versus feature driven B we want a banging lead magnet what we want to do ideally with a lead magnet is demonst demonstrate authority and expertise with something that they didn't know that they should know, right? Cuz either you reveal a problem, you give a sample of a solution, or you give a one step of a multi-step process. Those are the three types of lead magnets you can give.
(15:38) So, check this out real quick. So, this is a perfect example of an offer and lead magnet mismatch. So, kind of what I was saying in the beginning, like we're honing in here, and I'm pretty sure this is the problem. So, what I explained here, this is page 30 of the leads book. He's trying to do this.
(15:57) He's trying to go from low trust straight to a sale, right? And in that scenario, he might sell a couple people, which he is. But instead, what I'm trying to get him to do is put some sort of valuable lead magnet first, which goes getting people from low trust to high trust. And then that increases the number of people be more likely to buy from him after demonstrating value.
(16:14) This is probably the the like first big jump that we're going to do in the business that I think is going to have a huge impact on the growth. And what I was referencing for him is under lead magnets, uh, there's always a continuous problem solution cycle. And so the three types of lead magnets are just like I named real problem, have a free trial, or one step of a multi-step process.
(16:33) It's almost like I wrote the book on this [ __ ] Like I think that's the right direction cuz I think it being cocktail focused cuz right now we've been working on a lead magnet that's profit focused. Okay. And it's straightforward. I mean essentially it's a tool that they use in Excel and they pull up a PMIX. They put in their top 10 sellers. The quantity is the price. Yeah.
(16:53) They make a 50 cent dollar $2 adjustment and $50,000 in profit. Yeah. Imagine, you know, that's great for the profit driven avatar. Yeah. And so I don't know if there's a way to like kind of stack lead magnets. So I wouldn't stack them. I would just test one versus two. Got it.
(17:11) So, if we were to just test 97 versus 47, you might think, okay, well, maybe, you know, just from the front end, $97 in the test that we've run, actually, it converted almost the exact same amount, but it was twice the money. So, that was a good idea. But where the real money was was the fact that people who bought this were way more likely to spend money. Now, for me to answer why, no idea. Just know that.
(17:28) And so, this is why we test all the way through LTV, not just which one gets more opt-ins or which one gets more sales in terms of volume up front. What you might find, though, is that maybe the cost, and this is why it's important to track all the way to the sale. Yeah. And I'm going to show some more funnel stuff. I'll show you how we need to reorganize yours.
(17:49) But I would just run that as an AV. So you're going to run some ads. We're like, hey, so you'll do the same exact intro. Y and then the transition will be like, and if you want the top 10 drinks that you shouldn't be serving that actually hurt bars and their profitability, download my thing, and it'll show you 10 different ways of making them that are more profitable and faster. Got it.
(18:07) And then the other one is like, and if you want to see how much uh revenue you could potentially be missing out on, I have a tool that we use internally that I'll just give you for free. You can plug in your numbers and then it'll spit out exactly what the opportunity is. And if you're like, you know what, I'm not really a big Excel guy. That's fine.
(18:18) On the SK on the thank you page, schedule a call. We'll walk you through it specific to your bar right now. Right. Right. So, I think both those work and I I would just split test that. Like, I don't know the answer to that question. they will, but lead magnet for sure is one of the things that's missing from these ads and also probably why you're not getting the conversion you need to on the um on the on landing page.
(18:35) So, why don't you click? So, we're going to swap this ad out for an ad that talks about the lead magnet, has a painbased hook, and kind of mirrors some of the copy that I just went through. Okay, go for it. Okay, so right off the bat, that like the the most expensive real estate on this page is top to bottom, right? And so, you having your logo at the top, nix it, doesn't matter. No one knows who you are yet. they're coming from cold ads and like this isn't the branding opportunity.
(19:00) Got it? So, yeah, this is direct response. So, better bar program, I would take that out because they don't know what they're opting in for yet and that doesn't mean anything. Launch an elite high-profit bar. I would split test the hell out of that. It might be become the hottest bar in your town. Okay. Just try out a few different Yeah. No, 100%.
(19:17) And then beautiful cocktails, professional team, and seamless operations. I would nix that. So, I would want the sub headline to be basically the single largest concern someone has about the promise of the headline. Got it. So, here's this amazing thing and here's that thing that you're thinking about now that you don't believe me and so let me tell you why you should believe me in the next line, right? Like the reason you're a cocktail suck is because like yeah, I mean it could be like with or the without, right? So launch an elite high, you know, high profit bar um without having to redesign uh your existing location
(19:46) without buying expensive ingredients that go bad or having a really expensive training process. Sure. I don't This is just me thinking if I were a bartender. So here there's a lot of pieces to this and I don't think you need any of them because I've already gone through your funnel. I would basically drop this to just I'll tell you why.
(20:05) So I'm okay with all of these if it basically you collect this information twice in this funnel. I have you gone through it? I I built it. Okay. So, let me So, let's go through it. Let's just go, you know, aa just we just put whatever in. Okay. a aol.com. So, that was me. Yeah. Okay. [Laughter] My uh Yeah.
(20:24) My director of ops was freaking out. She's like, "Is that you guys?" She's like, "We got we got a lead. We got a hot one." So, let's say we click here now. Just click whatever time. All right. So, now I got to put it all in again, right? I'm like, "God, this sucks.
(20:42) " So, this is a really classic business owner mistake, which is that a lot of business owners haven't even gone through their own sales process. They set it up 2 years ago and they haven't like gone through it. You would be amazed at how many times you change a couple things and then you go through it again and you're like, "God, this looks horrible.
(20:53) " Except you're like running traffic to it and this is what customers are seeing and I like I'm guilty of this too. So, I'm not saying I'm immune to it. And so, having some regular cadence of actually going through clicking the buttons because this is obviously a ton of friction and this is bad friction. Good friction is you add qualifications, you make sure the right people are coming in, the bad people are going out.
(21:11) But this friction of just having people like repeat opting in for stuff or like very slow load times. That's bad friction that gets both good and bad people to stop opting in. So fundamentally, marketing comes down to having the sweet spot on friction. Because if I were to advertise, hey, here's my phone number and this is how much it is. Call me to buy. That would have the least amount of friction in the process possible.
(21:27) But the issue is I'd probably get a ton of people to call or maybe not. And it's just like it's too fast. On the flip side, if you make people jump through 30 hoops, you might have a perfectly qualified customer, but you're missing out on 90% of the people who would have bought if you just made it a little bit less frictiony. And so, it's all about the sweet spot between both extremes.
(21:45) And in general, the more expensive the product or service, the more friction you'll generally need to add. And so, my little moniker for this is the bigger the plane, the longer the runway in order to get it to take off. Okay, so now that we're we're back here, so first off, this needs to not be on YouTube. So, you need to get somebody because otherwise it looks it looks hokey.
(22:02) Get it on any third party. Get it on a Vimeo, whatever. Yeah. You don't want other recommend. It's just like it's taking people off the site and I don't think it looks good, right? Whatever. This is what your new funnel look like. So, you're going to have hopefully this looks like a book. Yeah. Okay. Got it.
(22:14) Okay. And then we have your email. We've got our headline, sub headline. Mhm. And then we've got our image. Right. So, then that's then going to go here, which you have uh congrats. And then we'll have our main our secondary headline. Now, here's where we put the video.
(22:35) Okay? Above above theuler, okay? And then the scheduleuler is going to be here. So, this will be VSSL. Then they'll have the booking and then postbooking will have a separate thing here which will one have the VSSL uh and the lead magnet. So, it's just like that way they can go to their email to get it, but they also can click here to get it. Just makes it convenient for them.
(22:53) But what we have here though is basically how to prepare for your call and just more selling. Yeah, I'm a huge advocate of having videos or kind of sales materials prior to a human intervention.
(23:12) And the reason for that is if you've ever done sales on a consistent basis, you end up kind of repeating the same presentation, if you will, over and over and over again. And so then it starts to sound rehearsed. The other person zones out, you zone out because you've said it so many times. I like taking all of the stuff that you kind of repeat over and over again in a sale and frontloading that.
(23:24) And so when you're on the call or when you start the call, you can start it like, okay, how's everything sound? And now we can basically start from the beginning to making a decision rather than like just like another pre-recorded, you know, vomit of a salesperson. And the other benefit of a video is that there's a lot more visuals, right? Like if you're talking on the phone, you're talking on Zoom, you'll be limited in the amount of visuals you can probably provide. Whereas here, you might be able to provide charts and graphs and statistics and visuals that make it more compelling
(23:48) and easier for somebody to understand. I would rather have the perfect pitch delivered every time in an automated format and then one have the customization be what the conversation is after the fact to get them to decide to buy or not. This is the new funnel, right? And this is what we advertise. And just real quick, this is after they schedule VSSL. This is the VSSL again.
(24:07) Just it's just a different one, but yeah, it's a different one, but more like prep for sales club. So, think about like this. Think about all the things that people present with on the call early that are their biggest concerns. Okay, that's what you put there. Okay. So, you might be wondering this, you might be wondering this. So, let me let me put your minds at rest. So, these are the things you need. You don't need this. You do need this.
(24:25) If you're concerned about these four things, I'll break them down one at a time. So, first things first, and then walk through it, and I'll be on. So, you know, have a computer. It's going to be a Zoom caller. Expect it from this number, whatever. So, call prep, concerns, and this VSL. This one's like more about like pain and promise. Okay.
(24:41) Got it. Yeah. If we honestly like if we just do this, you're probably going to like significantly increase your sales. Awesome. Um, and we do it like I mean like we could probably do nothing else today and like that's all that has to be done, right? Is that the ads need to go to the right avatar? Yep. Which is called out.
(24:58) We're actually going to give them a reason to go to this page that they can immediately get value from. They're going to opt in. Then we have our Now, if you want to do more of the uh you want to add more of the information uh that you were collecting over here, you can. That's fine with me. As long as it's fully integrated Yep. into here so that they don't have to do it twice.
(25:16) If you want, you can put a little on this side like in like a black banner across the top of this that has, you know, for $4 million plus only. Yep. Got it. This is This is a big a big part of this of what we were talking about earlier. Sip my brain juice for a second. Mhm. I'm going to spill over. I got a lot of stuff in here. Okay. So, you're confident about the $4 million avatar.
(25:43) Is there any reason that two and $3 million avatars don't work? They do. They just they're going to be a harder sell because their ROI isn't necessary. So then let's get to the offer part because this this like because this is this is the this is the funnel and process. But now let's talk about the offers that we're selling here. All right. So let's put this cuz now this is going to go to the phone.
(26:01) This is a phone for everyone who was born um before uh sorry after after 1995. So these are the offers. Okay. So Ben has a clear offer problem. I wrote my entire first book on this issue because it's one of the most common problems that limits businesses and the offer is a strategic thing that you do in that it affects the entire business.
(26:26) If you change your offer, it changes the advertising, it changes conversion process, it changes your pricing, it changes your deliverables. So, it changes everything. But because of that, if you nail the offer, that's where you can have these massive upticks in growth seemingly overnight. And so, I'll just read this little piece for you. No offer, no business, no life.
(26:45) Bad offer, negative profit, no business, miserable life. Decent offer, no profit, stagnating business, stagnating life. I would say he's right now between two and three. Good offer, some profit, okay business, okay life. And then what we want to build is a grand slam offer, fantastic profit, insane business, and freedom. That's what we want to get to. So, let's break this out.
(27:03) So, I think that that offer straight off the bat, selling $30,000 upfront, really tough sale. Totally a very very hard sell. So I like that he's charging premium prices for premium services. That makes sense. The problem is how he's selling it and when he's selling it. The right offer at the wrong time is still the wrong offer. That's the problem he has.
(27:22) And so this $30,000 thing absolutely should be and maybe we need to change that. Maybe that should be a 60 or $90,000 thing. But selling it right off the bat is kind of like he's getting people who've never met him before to just get on a call and then just try and buy.
(27:39) Rather than try and go for that, I'd rather go for a much easier sale that with that first product or service, we can give them the information so that now our entire business is about upselling customers into our 30, 60, $90,000 thing rather than spending six phone calls to close somebody on a $30,000 thing and having people drop off at each of those steps. This is how I if I owned your business, Mhm. I would have my front-end thing be like five or six grand.
(27:59) Okay? I would have it solve one very specific problem very well that more than, you know, gives them a 50k ROI on a $5,000 thing. But it's built in purposefully just to get the quick sale transition from prospect to customer. One call close, not three call closes, which I'm sure you're having to do right now just to close, right? Yeah.
(28:18) You're arm wrestling people to get 30 grand. We're missing the point of even having this simple salesunnel. And so get the 5K. Do the three calls you were going to do as a sale anyways. provide value for those three and then at the end sell your 30K thing. Got it? So, I think that the changes that Alex recommended for the funnel make a ton of sense.
(28:37) I'm not a professional funnel designer. I've really only been doing paid ads for the last year. And listening to somebody who's got as much vast experience like Alex tell me exactly what I need to do is super helpful. And I know that I could probably figure it out over many, many years and painful processes, but ultimately having this path to create a funnel that works is going to make me feel a lot better.
(29:09) So, what can we split off that's like five or six grand that would be immediately valuable to them that doesn't require a huge amount of work, but they could just like they could use your calculator, they could make these changes and immediately see like a return that would then create the necessity for your main thing. Yeah, I would say that the pricing is massive. Okay.
(29:27) Another thing would be like just very basic sales training for their teams. Like they need they need a script. Like they're bartenders and servers. If you don't have a script for your sales team, like you have no idea. And the way you look at that is very straightforward. How many drinks per person are you selling, right? You know number of guests, you know how many drinks you're selling, you know, drinks per guest. Yeah. Boom.
(29:44) That's like a pretty easy metric to like kind of like grasp onto. Which of those is easier for you to deliver on? The pricing is like massively easy because they just have to change in their penis. Then I would then I would I would go pricing audit first. Yeah. Because also there's immediate value in that. What I would do is like let's b calculate how much more profit you would have made last year if you had these prices. Yeah.
(30:00) And then they're like, "Holy [ __ ] I would have made 100 grand." And you're like, "Cool. So, pretty good return on the five." Great. If you like that, you're going to love what I have for you next, which is how do we actually make sure this happens consistently quarter over quarter. This is actually what we do with our, you know, with our premier our premier customers, right? It's too cold of a sale right now. Yeah.
(30:17) So, either we have to have a much longer sales process or we lower the bar so we can just get them in the door. Got it. And then we can upsell. Right. and and the profit booster, which is what we call it internally, is like you think that that is going to be meaty enough for them. Obviously, it's 5K, right? We're not selling 30.
(30:35) It's five, right? It's like, dude, if we just fix this one thing on more, then I know what your market looks like. I like we have comps in the area. We can tell you what this market can sustain. And that way, the question is, what's it worth to get it right on the first shot? Mhm. So, like, for sure, I could say, "Hey, just bump your prices by 10%." But you probably freak out about that. Of course you would, and rightfully so.
(30:53) So, what we're going to do is remix a couple of the things, get the prices appropriate to your area that we already know are working, so you don't have to you don't have to sweat about it, right? Done. So, it's like the only real cost to you is reprinting your [ __ ] menus, right? And then the next step is like, do you want to raise your prices again, but sooner? Well, you need a better quality product, better trained bartenders, etc.
(31:11) And I feel like that could help them kind of understand that they will have that opportunity to do it again sooner because they already got the bump. And the reason I want this one is because this is fast and easy. Yeah. Which I like selling those things first. You have to do this in order to do this. So, you might as well sell this first. Okay.
(31:28) And the fact that it's easy and fast and profitable like that checks all the boxes for fast, easy, risk-f free. There you go. Got it. Right. I think we make this 5,800 on the phone for the pricing booster, whatever you want to call it. Yep. And then what we do is that then leads to the quarterly retainer at I think you had 9K per quarter, right? And that's probably how I'd price it.
(31:48) So, Alex's idea about the $5,800 offer really makes a lot of sense when he was explaining that trying to sell somebody a $30,000 service cold isn't working. There was a little bit of an aha moment, but actually it's makes a ton of sense. So, I'm excited to try to find an opportunity to give our clients or prospects that will become our clients exceptional value right off the bat.
(32:13) will one make it a lot easier to go to the next step and also give us a lot of quick wins so that we're not constantly putting in all this work to get nothing. Trying to think about the easiest way to do this. I would probably end up doing a rollover upsell. So, we're selling step one of a multi-step process. That's what this is. Yep. And I would seed that up front.
(32:32) So, when you sell the thing, it's like, listen, I'll be real with you. My whole goal isn't to give you this pricing audit. I'm just going to easily ROI myself and like everybody will be happy. What I really want to do is help you really transform the bar.
(32:44) Yeah, because you know you can only do a pricing change once and then after that what do you do right? But even if we make this pricing change great we made you an extra 100 grand but wouldn't it be cool to make an extra million? Now I'm not promising that because obviously your results will vary depends on your market but what I can do is basically walk you through what it takes to truly build this into a staple that then also drives people into the food side.
(33:00) So it becomes a a virtuous cycle. And so what I want to do is take your your your 5800 and I'll credit towards the year. So if you're wondering should every business have a backend and a front end or multiple offers? The answer is it depends. And I know that's a terrible answer, but I'll tell you what it depends on. There's a certain amount of information that is required for somebody to make a decision.
(33:17) Depending on where they come in on that continuum of needing a little bit of information versus needing a lot of information, then there has to be more selling that must occur. Then the next constraint that comes up in the business is cash flow.
(33:30) Well, if we're spending money to get these people in, we want to recoup that cash as fast as we can. And for somebody to buy maybe a $100,000 thing, it takes more time and more information to make that decision. And during that time, we're spending all this money in labor and advertising, but we're not seeing any return. The idea of sometimes having a front end and backend offer is mostly just to pull cash forward, offset the the cash, the the cash outlay, which is another way of saying uh decrease the payback period or increase the cash conversion cycle.
(33:53) Lots of fancy words, but basically just get money back faster. So that then everything after that's all gravy. You recoup the money. Now you go get another customer. And then this person's all in the incention process. for example, his advertising was all brand-based and all inbound, then he could probably get away with just going straight to a more expensive thing because they've already consumed so much information prior to that.
(34:15) But since he's almost entirely based on cold traffic ads, we have to lower the bar to get people to just take that small jump so that he can then prove himself to then take the big jump. Got it. Seen that before. Yeah. Because it works. Yeah. And so, and you do it, but it's like you only get that if you do that during the the two to four weeks that we have, right? So that's the that's the time window we can apply it towards, right? And if you want, I'll apply it to your first payment. So, you know, the the 9K becomes 4K for your
(34:40) first quarter and then you go into 9K after that. Or if you want, one of my personal favorites is just knock off 1,500 per quarter. So, make this 105 or you know, 10K per quarter, but if you do it now, it's 8,500. Got it? And we knock it off that way. We we spread the discount over four quarters.
(34:58) I gave Ben two different ways of applying the discount. I prefer spreading discounts because I don't want an easy yes and then go from 4K to 9K and then them say, "Oh, actually, I'll just get the quarter and then I'll cancel." I'd rather spread the discount out and get the commitment over the long term.
(35:11) And so, if someone's willing to pay the 8,500, they're like, "Okay, well, that was nice of him to credit the the 5,800 or $6,000 towards my payment." So, it's like a nice gesture. It encourages people to take action, but it's not so much so that it's it's getting the wrong type of customer in because the price is going to double. That way, you're not, you know, crushing your first your first payment. Sure.
(35:29) and the 9K per quarter which is what we're doing that is continuity on the better cocktail consulting thing. So how do we how sticky is that? How sticky is it? How how are people re upping the actual design and implementation of their cocktail menus or of this are people turnurning out of this? Uh they yes like basically anybody who buys it as part of the initial package they don't continue on with it like they stop after two quarters. I have my suspicions on why that's happening. Okay. Why? uh we are not showing them the value. We're not
(35:58) we're not demonstrating it in a meaningful way. Like we're we're supposed to fill out a scorec card. We're supposed to show them week over week how much better their program is doing. We're not. You're not doing it. Well, I have like Well, you have the team. Sure. Yeah. So, there's a little warning alarm that's going off for me right now, which is that if people are turning out in two quarters, basically two payments, that's not a good sign. You know, he nailed it. He's not providing value. That's a kind of a mor
(36:20) amorphous big term. But underneath of that, it's like the question is why? One of the difficult parts with uh consulting or education is that if you're what I would consider quote a onetrick pony, I'm not saying Ben is, but if you are, then once you kind of like implemented your thing, it's like why should someone keep paying you? So, I like to figure out ways that we can have some sort of consumables or something that is always changing in the business that is required for you to keep providing value. One of the benefits of a bar restaurant is that
(36:44) they're always getting new staff in. And so, new staff needs to get trained up consistently. Now, the downside is if they learn how you train, then they'll just say, "Well, I'll just train them myself and not pay you this money." We have to figure out a way to make the backend stickier or just accept that it's not and then charge an appropriate amount of money for it so that you deliver that value, you have a good margin, and you just understand that that's the nature of the business. And the good news is there's a gazillion
(37:09) restaurants and bars, and so you'll be able to do that for a very long time. Well, some people try to create recurring revenue for recurring revenue sake, but some products and services are not really meant to be recurring. There's a reason that after four years of of education in college, you graduate. After high school, you move to the next thing.
(37:26) Like education in general tends to graduate people. They learned and because they learned, they no longer, you know, should continue. Now, how does the education system uh deal with this? They just give you more and more majors and you can become a master and you have a PhD and you can become a double secret PhD, right? They'll just always give you something else.
(37:44) It's more common in like an education and consulting business like his, but the businesses that are most valuable obviously are businesses that once someone comes in, they never want to leave or stop paying. But it doesn't mean that you can't make a ton of money in businesses that you do just one-time services on. So, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. There's just less enterprise value.
(37:54) Why are they doing it? I think there's a little bit of resistance to just kind of numbers in general from them. From them. I co-designed that component of it for them to do. Is there a way that you can just get a login to their system and then collect it? Definitely.
(38:11) I'll bet you if you logged into their system and once a month they had a meeting with you where you showed them their numbers, it would almost feel like I have like this guy knows all my stuff. I have to you know what I mean? And so I think that would be worth the extra time cost. Maybe it's 2 hours per per account or whatever cares, right? That to me feels worth improving cuz if you don't if if you can't fix churn, there's no point in doing any of this, right? Cuz otherwise you just have people falling out the back. It's like we have to start with people staying and then we can fix all
(38:33) the front end stuff cuz why would we pour more to a leaky bucket, right? So, how does this process feel? Overall, feels great. I mean, it it's in line with the direction I wanted to go in. It's just obviously laid out much more clearly and using a system that that you know works. Okay, good.
(38:51) As an entrepreneur, you try to figure out a lot of things on your own. You can do it a lot of ways. You can do it by doing the research, trying things out, or working with people who have been there and done it before. with Alex. Not only has he been there and done it before, he's been there, done it incredibly well multiple times for businesses in tons of different industries. And so when he says that something's going to work, I believe it.
(39:17) The sales training is like the intermediary. Is that kind of what you're recommending here? Because in my head, the offer component starts with the pricing part because that's the easy win, right? that would then move into the cocktail consult the better cocktail the $30,000 offer and then that would move into the 9,000 a quarter.
(39:36) Any reason to not just push them into continuity because they probably still have shitty cocktails. I could make that just I could just say we'll start we'll just do our program and it'll just we'll do it in the first three months. It'll be the first quarter we'll be program that's fine as long as we can maintain the continuity. Yeah.
(39:54) There's an offer structure that I like a lot called the wave fee offer. So basically, I could say, "Listen, this thing I charge $30,000 for." Yep. If you commit for the year, y I'll wave it. Yep. But you're committing for it now. If you want to cancel two quarters in, you have to pay me this. Yep. Got it.
(40:12) So it's like I'll eat the If I take the risk on, you make the commitment. That's the risk you take. Yep. And I'll front you all this work. Mhm. If you take the risk, so you want to have the you don't want the commitment, then pay for that. I'll do it. And then it's month, it's quarter to quarter. Yep. Which one would you prefer? Got it.
(40:29) But now it's an AB close, right? That help? Yep. Absolutely. Okay. I'm going to talk about ascension in a second, but I think I think big picture, we have funnel redo. Yep. So, we got that going. Mhm. Number two is ad call outs. Three is we have new lead magnet. Four, we have So, inside of funnel redo, we have three-step and then Vimeo video above. Yeah.
(40:54) And then we have integrateuler with optin. All right, let's pull this page up again real quick. So, I'm going to design this as though it were the second page cuz the first page is really simple. It's just headline, sub headline, image, optin. That's it. Got it? All right.
(41:13) So, basically the first half here you could peel off and make that the first page, but you'll have a picture of the thing that you're you're going for, right? And you're going to remove the the top two, you know, you remove your logo, you're going to remove better bar program, take that out. Beautiful cocktails is going to be the uh without X Y and Z that you're confir you you know your your biggest concerns. Now let's scroll down.
(41:26) All right. Cocktails that capture highly trained bar teams functional product. I would think about it like this like create drinks that create regulars. Get staff that customers can't wait to come back to. And tip like crazy, you know, parenthesis. Sure. And then functional operating processes. That's like all about headache reduction. Yeah.
(41:45) I want to think like functional operating processes. is the way to the way what I think about when I'm writing copy. Yeah. Is what are the moments? So if I have functional like operating process, what's the moment for me as a restaurant owner or a bar owner that I would experience the benefit of functional operating processes? Is it when I realized that I didn't have to throw out all this inventory that I like all these old pineapples that I thought I was going to need and then toss out? Like like what's the moment or moments? It's a it's kind of one of those things like when you notice the pain isn't there
(42:13) anymore, right? Like that's a hard thing to kind of put your finger. Well, then tell me what the pain is. Pain works fine. Like like the pain that they typically have with dysfunctional operating process. Give me a moment. Is like when they walk in, the bar is a total mess cuz no one knows how to set it up. Like no more disaster back bar back or back of bar. Mhm. Boom.
(42:32) Like it just like you can you can do the negative or the the the relief of the positive. Okay. Now let's scroll up. Okay. Unlock consistent proven results. I would say like we drive quarter over quarter alcohol sales growth cuz that's what it that's what to me proven results doesn't mean anything as a word. Mhm. 30% cocktail sales, 40% return of beverage, 50% speed of service.
(42:52) I would actually use the numbers as the subtext and I would use the benefit as the primary text. Okay, so speed of service is like get rid of waiting lines and then it says underneath 50% boost in speed of service. That's me personally. So I referenced earlier in the ads around the copy, but now we're applying the same frameworks from who, what, when to the landing page.
(43:16) I like to speak in terms of moments because people don't really like they have to translate or unpack a word of like a process or some specific improvement. It just takes mental effort and every piece of mental effort you ask someone to use a certain percentage of people say, "Nah, I've got other things in my life." And they'll dip. I want to predigest the food.
(43:33) I want to predigest the pain and explain the moments that they probably recently experienced that will then make them believe that I have complete context on their problem and therefore are high likely to be able to solve it. So, there's a number of really small things that you can do at a page that can have a really big improvement.
(43:45) First off, like everything that someone sees above the fold, like that's the most important part of the page. Like what happens on someone's mobile device or their desktop before they scroll, that's above the fold is kind of what they say in the marketing world.
(43:57) If you've got like the name of your business and it's cold traffic, they don't know, they don't care. So, like take that out because they don't know who you are. And so, then the headline itself, it's like we want it to be some sort of very clear like reason for them to move forward. And then I usually have sub headlines that clarify or add context to the headline. And so often times that'll be like without X, Y, and Z or without pain. It qualifies it.
(44:15) Underneath that it's like I want it to be as simple and clear as possible what they're going to get. And then basically everything below the fold is just if you're still skeptical, let me just give you more information to make the decision.
(44:28) But I want all of the information I'm providing to be relevant to why someone should move forward, not just like a whole bunch of stuff about us. And then make sure that you have disclosures around around results to make sure you explain how these things are calculated and otherwise it could just be an unsubstantiated claim. So, lead mag. So, we have the new lead magnet. Uh, we have the new funnel. We have the new ad callouts. This is great.
(44:45) We're going to have the $5,800 pricing offer, which I like. And then ascension. Okay. Which is going to be rollover. I think there's a C in there somewhere. No. Ascension via rollover plus waved 30k offer. All right.
(45:09) Also, the thing is is this this in-person onboarding is going to serve as such a good like first experience for them because you're going to fly out, you're fix, like, "Wow, this was so worth it." And right now, your team does all of this stuff, right? Not you. I'm all acquisition. Okay. You're But the people flying out is your team. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. No, I never I I stay at home. So, what I want to do Yeah.
(45:29) Yeah. So, what I want to do is add an ultra high ticket with you. Yeah. So, just 5x the price. Yeah. And you can uh present that first leader or the get the gas and be like or I can have my team do it. It's me the exact same process. It's just I got I got a wife and kids and so you want me out there I'll do it. Happy to. And it's just obviously you know this is what we do but they're going to run the same flip. Got it.
(45:46) So effectively the $5,800 pricing is part of like an extended sales off% instead of taking three calls or four calls like you are right now. Just get paid deliver the value and then once you have an exchange they get more than what what it's worth. Customers versus prospects are like 10 times more likely to buy again, of course.
(46:03) And so just get them, make them customers so you can increase the likelihood. So then they buy again, right? Like give them a ton of value. Have it all be with me. And it's easy cuz this is just pricing related, right? It's pricing third, you know, 15 30-day fix. They immediately see the value. You're like, dude, if you like this, you're going to love that, right? Do you feel like there's a t like a lot of value from me doing all that fulfillment or do you think that that's something that I can also have somebody on my team? I think you do it first to get a feel for it. Sure. Totally. that. And uh
(46:28) and cuz what I want to make sure that we nail is this. Got it. Cuz we're not in it for the $5,800 thing, right? We're in it because we want to see I would want to see at least 50% upgrading into that. Yep. Okay. Get that get to here and then make them the money to pay you the next thing. And I would say the way that I operate is that I never want to ask you for money I haven't already made you.
(46:49) Got it. And you'll notice that's a common theme of how I roll. And so it's like let me go make you a h 100red grand. We make you that with the the new bar program, right? And then with the next thing, it's going to cost you a third of what I already made you, right? So, you're good.
(47:02) I've already made room for you to afford me, right? Essentially, it's much easier sale, right? So, I charge them $5,800. They're now making $9,000 a month, month over month, and they're like, "Oh, look, you have $90,000 that you didn't have before. Look, you can use that on us." Right? Got it. And you want to make sure that you make that offer before the end of that 30-day period. Totally.
(47:18) So, it's like you want to offer it at week two, three, again at four if you need to. And it the way that I offer those things is either I'll do immediate upsells if I don't have that, which in this one it doesn't make sense. So you'd have the milestone moment.
(47:35) So they implement it and they have their first weekend after the pricing audit and their sales are the same or their sales go up and they're like, "Holy [ __ ] I made way more money." So that would be a moment that I would immediately ask for the sale. The next one um that I would have is basically like the next week cuz this is a pretty short time. And then finally you have last chance. So you have three shots at the sale for this. Now you were taking sales calls before. Yeah.
(47:52) But now you're talking to a customer. Yeah. And they've already delivered them value, right? Easier. And they're making money. Exactly. Okay. I mean, big picture, if we're looking at this, like the funnel redo on its own could very well triple the lead volume that you're getting right now. Okay.
(48:09) Honestly, just the combination of the funnel redo, the ad call out, and having a lead magnet that actually resonates with that specific avatar, like this alone could probably just triple. Mhm. Just these things. Mhm. This is going to dramatically improve sales velocity. Sure. Let's talk about sales real quick. What do you do? Like so what's the walk me through what like how you structure the conversation for sales. You already have something.
(48:26) Yeah. So that's the that this is the like the click to close, right? Prospect the ad, they visit the landing page. Soon to be optimized. Yeah. Fill out the form. Yeah. Yeah. Fill out the form and that automates a text message. Text message and email flow. So text message and email. This I guess if they didn't book. Yeah.
(48:44) It'll still it'll still go out. They'll have the for the link to book, etc. It also triggers a call for my director of ops who's largely involved in the uh the intake process. So she conducts an intake. This was previously for the we had this intake process in place because of lowquality leads. So she would take an intake call uh 15 minutes. If they were qualified, she sent them off to me.
(49:07) I'd conduct a discovery usually about 30 minutes. I talk to them about what their biggest pain points are. I ask them all the different questions about what they want to see. What percentage of them have been watching the video? This new video? No. What percentage of them have been watching the video after like when they get on the phone with you? Oh, that that video is new. Okay. Yeah.
(49:25) So, that's like month. Got it. Yeah. Well, this last month you've taken sales calls. Have any of them mentioned the video? No. Okay. So, they're not watching it. So, this the way that I structured it here where they're going to have to see the video before they Well, they'll see it and they'll have to scroll in order to get to theuler will probably increase the likelihood they they actually watch it. But the other thing is is that that set call. Yep. So, I'm going to make this number seven.
(49:47) set goes to then video. Yep. To then close. So, your director of ops is going to say, "Awesome. So, uh I'm going to set you up with Ben, but before you get on, I'm going to send you this video. Make sure you watch it and I'm just going to say do that cuz the first question he's going to ask you is, did you watch the video?" So, and if you have it, he's just going to say, "Okay, I'm going to grab a coffee. Can you watch the video?" So, you're going to do it either way, so you might as well just do it now.
(50:10) And so, and also for you when you hop on the call, I'll be like, "Did you watch the video?" If they say no, it's like, "Great, watch that." And I'd be like, and the reason we do that is because I already have a lot of facts and figures and things like that that I could describe with my words, but it'll take us three times as long as you just watching it. And so then that'll give us good context rather than me just spewing stuff at you, which most people are like, "Okay, fair enough.
(50:28) " But you don't want me to just give you a lecture for 10 minutes. I don't want to either. This has some graphs. It has some figures in it. That makes it a little bit more more digestible for you. Totally. And so yeah, that'll be the sales process there. Mhm. Proposed call. And you'll be like, honestly, if you do these things at this price point, I think you'll be able to start closing like at that point a lot. Yeah.
(50:46) Yeah, cuz if we if you were closing like 50% which I think you could if you're an owner operator and you're at this point after this kind of process you'll you'll I mean I think you could some some people owner operator close like 80% on these calls. So I'm a big believer in founders selling the product in the beginning and I think there's a number of reasons for that. One is it keeps you close to the customer. You can understand how the marketing is doing.
(51:03) You can see who's coming in and that will give you a very rapid feedback loop in terms of what you need to adjust on the front end and how you can kind of get feedback on your offer and your pricing. And it takes out one very important variable, which is that if you have a salesperson who's in there, you might not know if they're doing a good job. So you might be like, "Ah, they're not closing.
(51:21) What's the problem?" And they might be like, "I don't know. These leads suck." But like, is it a pricing issue? Is it a copy issue? Is it an avatar issue? Being closer to it, you would be like, "Oh, no.
(51:33) Is this these are the these are the right people that we're talking to and they're just shocked at the price or they're not shocked at the price, but they're just not getting it." And so each of those would kind of offshoot into different types of solutions. The big thing is though, I like founder selling in the beginning as well because when you're the founder, you're the most convicted.
(51:46) And so you will typically be able to outperform any salesperson and in the beginning when you have fewer resources, you could use the extra conversion percentage and the decreased cost of not having a salesperson or paying the commission. So think I can close twice as many sales and I don't have to pay the commissions for it. It frees up cash flow so that we can make some of these big bets early on that are going to build the foundation for the business.
(52:04) There's so few leads that are coming in that I think he should be taking these calls. Basically, until he can't take these calls anymore. And by the time he can't take these calls anymore, he's already completely blown past his revenue level. He'll have a whole bunch more revenue and cash flow to then solve the problem of him not having time. And that's the game of business.
(52:21) With that being said, that would be like if you just did that, it would be more than a 5x in sales. Mhm. Because if you'd get to 30% close rate would mean that you'd make the same revenue, right? without your actual $30,000 back end, right? But if you're at 50%, you're making 40% more revenue and then you still have your back end, right? One last thing is that I understand why you're not spending that much money, but you were spending too little money.
(52:46) With the fixes that we're at now, it it would be okay to keep the spend that you have, but if I were selling a $30,000 thing, you're barely sell you're barely advertising enough to get enough volume for something of that ticket. And so for me, if I test stuff, I usually test at two times CAC per campaign. Yep. So, sorry. Two time. Yeah. Two times allowable CAC, not current CA. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Exactly.
(53:05) Um, that's kind of my benchmark per campaign, though. So, I might run multiple campaigns to figure out which one's working. But for you, your your funnel process was messed up and that's why this is that's why your your numbers aren't good. Yeah. Got it.
(53:18) So, what I'm referencing here is that I budget two times the cash I collect from the from a customer in 30 days when I'm testing new ads. For example, if I make $100 in profit from a customer in the first 30 days, I will let an ad go to $200 in spend before shutting it off as long as I'm getting leads. And the reason for that is usually because there's a certain amount of inefficiency in the beginning that you have to be willing to stomach to find the ads, the copy, the hooks, the creative variations that are going to ultimately perform.
(53:40) I have to be able to stomach bad ads that don't convert and make up for it in good ads that do convert and then be like, "Okay, so this is working not as efficiently as I want, but it's working. Now, let's double down on this and make 10 more variations that are more similar to this messaging." Yeah. And once he finds the messaging that converts, it's like by all means blow the doors off and you know spend as much as you can or at least as much as you can while being able to take all the sales calls. That's it. Like this really fixes this. The good thing is like this like you wanted to hit your triple. I make no
(54:03) guarantees. These are high likely like shots. Okay. That's very encouraging. Yeah. No, you've got it. And I think this is the key cuz also think about all the calls you're not going to have to take. All the ones that are three calls and then don't close. Right.
(54:20) Right. You're spending all your time on these wasted calls when it could be one call closing 5,800 5800 5800. And so you see this as a one call close at 5,800 like discovery for sure. Discovery like oh that's your problem. Yeah, I figured for sure like here's here's the solution right here. Not even a question. Yeah, got it. That's like there you should be expecting one and you should set that as the agenda. You'll say your you know the four things you have to say legally. Hey this is X call from Y in regards to Z.
(54:41) You know by the way this call is recorded. Before we get going um just want to say you know how you doing today? Great. Uh let me set the agenda. I'm going to go through the lead magnet thing that you just got. I'm gonna understand some of the metrics about your about your bar and then at the end um if it's a good fit, I can explain to you um how we might be able to help you out. Sound good? Great. And then we just go through.
(54:59) I almost forgot cuz Michael wants me to do this. Oh yeah, we could this could be this could be I mean it actually could be your triple could be right here. Um you could definitely two to 3x your call outs uh in terms of CTRs with the ad call out. I'll bet you your conversion rate.
(55:17) Do you know what your conversion on your on your landing page is right now? Like last year it was like 7%. Okay. So, so 7% could probably go closer to 30% which is my benchmark for a lead mag landing page which should be like a nice little chill 4x here. I think you going from 6% close rate to like 30 to 50% is super reasonable given the fact that you were the one who's going to be selling it and the price point is what it is.
(55:40) So I think in a real way you might even make more money just selling this than you're currently doing with none of the extra work and then all of this. God bless. This right here is just going to be gravy. Yeah. So, you're basically going to be able to stack potentially probably a double of your current revenue from this source, but then stack 100% of your current revenue from this. How do you like this plan? Love it. It's a lot of what I want to do. Oh, good.
(56:01) And it's I've started kind of trying to figure out if this is something that makes sense for me to do and then obviously seeing it all on paper and coming from you gives me a lot more confidence to want to do it. I would do it pretty much in this order. You're going to redo the funnel. Yep. Once the funnel's redone, technically the lead mag would happen at the same time as the funnel. So one and three happen together. Yeah.
(56:19) Ad call outs, you then run the ads. This is basically your phone process. So this happens up front. Four and six would happen together cuz this is sales process. Yep. The ascension happens after they buy. This is also going to happen again with sales process. So basically one and three together, two happens next.
(56:32) Four, six, seven happen third. Then you go back to your ads guys and say, "Hey, go spend more. Go find more keywords." Say it's a grand slam offer. There we go. Hold on. Let me let me It's all about the picking. Cool. Cool. All right. Awesome. I was both very excited and very nervous to come into something like this to really put it all out there and be vulnerable, not just in front of somebody who I have an immense amount of respect for, but also people who are going to watch this video. You guys, that was awesome
(57:06) getting through that, right? And I felt once it was actually done felt amazing, right? Like it felt great to know that I have a path forward that I can really count on. And while I know that no guarantees are there, I do know that I feel a lot better and that's important.
(57:24) So I really liked Ben's business is clearly he understands the the bar business well, which is one of my big requisites, like actually be good at the thing before trying to sell the thing. I think if he makes some of the changes that I outlined, it's very likely that the business does well. And I like to be clear.
(57:37) This is in no way a promise that you who's watching this is home. If you do this in your business that you'll get the same results because his results are completely up to him and the effort that he takes and his background and his knowledge. So your results may vary. That being said, if you enjoy this type of stuff, these business breakdowns, these cash guys episode, you'll definitely want to check out this

Transcript:
(00:00) I'm going to explain how to un your business there are six problems that most businesses present with I own a portfolio of companies at acquisition. comom that do over $250 million a year and I see business owners at our headquarters all the time whether we're looking to invest in the business or they're just looking for help and so these six problems plague many many businesses so in this video I'll show you how to solve them the right path to take and one example of a portfolio company that we actually walk this
(00:23) through so number one is serve too many avatars so what does that mean so if you don't know what an avatar is by the way an avatar is just like a ideal customer profile ICP there's different you know there's different language in different Industries what they call it but basically who are you trying to serve who's your customer and who's your daddy anyways and so serve too many avatars basically means that you're just saying yes to anyone with money and not necessarily saying yes to only those people who you can deliver the most value to Andor who can pay the prices
(00:51) that you want to charge and so this is fairly common especially when you're starting out call it you know sub $3 million a year uh in Revenue because in the beginning you're just saying yes anyone who's got money right you're just saying oh he's got a credit card therefore he is qualified right and it that that can that can obviously create issues in the short term for you now the reason for that is because when you sell to too many different people you have too many different expectations that have to be set on the front end so it makes your marketing less effective
(01:17) because you have to be everything to everyone which means you're nothing to no one uh on a on a sales perspective it's more difficult to train sales teams because they have to be trained on many different prospects and potentially many different versions of the product uh with different expectations being set for for each one of them that can be really complex on the third level like if that weren't enough like really hard marketing really hard sales the third piece is that your team that does delivery then has to get trained on all
(01:40) these different types of delivery for all these different types of avatars and again the reason that people still keep doing this is because they always need to make payroll they always need to make pay make rent and they're afraid if they turn customers away who are less qualified that they're not going to be able to do it so by doing avoiding the short-term pain of actually being like you know what these are the customers that we do well with these are the ones we don't and we need to get more of these uh and we're willing to have a short-term loss in order to really establish the business uh people just
(02:05) stay in this like everything to everyone land which sucks and so when I say narrow the front end I mean that the messaging and the lead magnets or the things that you offer people in your advertisements whether that's through outbound through content through paid ads or even through Affiliates if you're giving you give something away in order to get people's information you call them up you sell them whatever you want to make sure that that's narrower if I say hey the hair industry here's a free report on the hair industry that's going to get anyone in the industry if I say how to get your first five uh hair you
(02:34) know cut and color clients I'm going to probably I might get some salon owners but I'll probably be skewed heavily towards hair stylists if I said how to fill up your hair salon and get all 10 of your chairs filled within 30 days then I'm going to have a much I'm going to skew harder towards salon owners and so the messaging the call out that you have in the ad if you say attention salon owners then you'll get Salon if you say attention hair stylist you'll get hair stylist if you say I'm going to help you fill your salon you'll get more
(02:59) salons like hope this makes sense but you get narrower in your messaging but here's the thing that everyone's afraid of this is the big fear here if I get narrower in my messaging I'm going to get fewer leads yes and no if you get narrow when you're messaging you will have a higher response rate in general from that particular segment and so sometimes the LTV toac ratio actually expands it gets even better when you because then you don't have the smaller one that you're diluting it down with and all of your focus and the um copy gets so much crisper for that person and
(03:30) they think this is what you want them to think when they see your ad oh this is just for me oh rather than like I might find some value here that's the difference yeah and so um because I talk a lot about marketing stuff I I tend to have a lot of marketing agencies um that follow my stuff as well and if I were to invest in a marketing agency I would want one to be in a vertical I'd want it to be in a niche I'd want to buy an agency that only Services painters I want to serve one that only Services plumbers not one that just says like if you run ads we do that um it's just much
(03:59) it's just it's just harder it's just it's too many things to too many people so the fix here is you look at the LTV toac you see the one that has the greatest discrepancy relative to how much how big the market is and then you cut one of the front ends to the one that you get the best uh return on ads spend and then either you bridge to the second or cut the second off so the second Horseman of our our business apocalypse is underpriced and so this is where you charge too little to be able to scale your business and so most
(04:27) people when they pick how much they're going to charge they just look at the maret Marketplace they take the average and say I'm going to do a little bit more value for a little bit less money and that's how they pick but the thing that they don't know is that everyone's broke that's the fun fact is that the average business owner makes very little money and um takes on a tremendous amount of risk in order to make very little money and so um what I want to walk you through is kind of a a three-phase plan for for getting out of
(04:53) this particular scenario okay and so fundamentally you have two types of customers you've got the existing customers and you've got the new customers so we're actually going to solve these in kind of a reverse order so your existing customers are the ones that you already have these the people who pay you every month or they continue to come back whatever the second is new customers these are the people who are the leads right now who will eventually become customers in the future now when we actually want to make a pricing change we actually do it like this we want to do new customers first and then
(05:21) existing customers second and I'll explain the process and so when you do the new customers here's how it works you just raise your price that's it you just raise your price that's all you have to do is that when you get to the point on the script where you would normally say hey it's $1,000 you just say hey it's $1,500 or it's $2,000 and one of the things that people don't understand is that you will get more nose but you can also make more money and so let me walk you through this so let's say that we doubled our price and let's say our close rate before this was
(05:55) we were closing uh 30% of people that we get on the phone with okay now if we doubled our price and our Clos rate drop to 20% that's a great deal we should do that every day while still getting more NOS than we were before and this gets difficult for people to wrap their heads around especially entrepreneurs because we and sales people like you want to get yeses and it hurts to get rejection but you just have to let this be a math problem and then solve for it now let's say that you get on the front end and you make this change and if the market
(06:24) accepts that change they bear the higher cost or the higher price that you want to switch to that then gives you day to to go to your existing customer base now I'm not recommending that you just say hey guys I just raised prices good luck that will surely piss a lot of people off so instead what we do is uh we have a we have a process that you basically want to walk through so number one is you're going to send them an email saying that something big is going to come so you just give them a little bit of like brace yourself so you just like
(06:49) a little brace right uh big news coming tomorrow um just letting you know whatever B then in the email itself what you want to do is number one straight to it just let them know that you're going to be raising the prices number two then tell them that this is not because you're a greedy bastard but because you want to fulfill promises and you see that you're no longer fulfilling the promises that you originally promised them and in order to reinvest in the business that's going to get them a b c benefit as a result of this investment
(07:25) because they don't care about you or anything they just care about what what is it w ifm uh what's in it for me so you just have to explain to them that you're going to be taking this money you're going to be reinvesting in them and what they're going to get as a result now uh before this we do the little reminder sorry I forgot to include this uh of value which is hey you've been with us for X period of time and we've made you this much money we've saved you this much time we've cut your grass this many times we've gotten this you know you left at these reviews you want to demonstrate or remind them of the value they've already provided them
(07:57) then you tell them the bad news then you put that bad news in context of the promises that they're going to get then and this is the this is where you soften the blow and so you soften the blow by saying hey I already raised the price on these [ __ ] these new guys who haven't been here for a while I've already raised the price on them but because you're and you have been a loyal customer I'm going to give you a discount for the next 3 to six months on that original price and so the new price is effective today that's when you say that it's straight here but like slow down I'm going to give you a discount equal to your current payment
(08:36) for the next 6 months and then after that point you will then go up to the regular price and that's as a reward or a thank you for being so loyal and so you give them the price raise but you soften the price raise with the discount and then people are much more comfortable having a discount disappear than a price go up and so also we're extending out when the Pain's going to happen and so it's like you give them the news today but then you're like oh no no don't worry doesn't affect you today it's going to affect you in the future future use problem right and so that again this softens the blow and then finally you want to have a little
(09:06) PS statement that at the end you say hey by the way and this humanizes you you say hey by the way um if you're going to go homeless because of this this price increase if you're not be able to afford groceries if this is going to materially affect your business if you're B2B just please reach out to me I would love to like get on the phone with you and we'll figure out something that's it and so then the thing is is most people when they read that you're going to have one or two like most people read that be like h i get it if you're B2B they're
(09:31) like he's a business owner I get it whatever if it does materially affect their business then they can get on the phone and maybe you can extend it another 6 months or you can ratchet it up more slowly or you can peel off a piece of the service that you offer them um so basically it's like you have price in terms and so it's like you can shift the terms to make the original price still just as profitable for you without having to deliver as much uh value per se to the customer and so this is kind of like this is a quick and dirty process um for walking through this now if you have like a community or something like that where you make this
(10:03) uh post and i' I've walked a lot of businesses through this uh when you make the post just turn off comments and say hey we want to keep this IRL so in real life so if you have any questions please reach out to me this is not going to be a gossip Fest just hit me up I'd love to talk to you all right and so um this is how we solve the underpriced problem and if you're curious about how this process works I actually have a letter inside of my gym launch Secrets book that walks gym owners how to walk through a price increase because many of them are underpriced because they're like like I did this for passion and they realize
(10:31) that they make no profit um and so and you can't expand your passion if you make no profit and so I've walked hundreds of of gyms through this and and you know countless other businesses but like I have walked through price raises on uh recurring customers which is significantly tougher than what just simply raising a price on customers that are onetime purchase if you're a onetime purchase one like don't even worry about it just raise the price you'll be fine and if you need to adjust it later then
(10:55) just peel something off if you if you go too high and all of a sudden your Clos rate drops too too low that actually doesn't make sense just back down one and just give those guys something extra that's it so the third land ofy is overcompensation so this is kind of like the sister of underpricing and the reason this is so tough is that it's the equal opposite instead of saying you're not pricing high enough it's saying I'm paying too much my cost of goods is too high and so if you have physical products you might have less wber room in terms of your cost unless you have some sort of massive breaks around volume as you you know scale and you get
(11:29) a iies of scale um but with a service business and this is where it typically happens is you have a new founder who does some sort of rev share profit share deal with what I would consider high-skilled labor and in so doing they're like yeah yeah I just do I just do go 5050 with my therapists or something like that but the therapists aren't responsible for the overhead they're not responsible for the cost of requiring customers they're not responsible for retaining customers they don't do anything besides show up and like crack backs or whatever right and when you're in one of those situations
(12:01) it's tough and so the reason there's a lot of reasons it's tough but you actually kind of want to go through the same price raise concept but you're just doing it on the employee level and except it's a decrease instead of an increase and you just basically I'll walk through the same steps so it says existing so this works out fine so existing employees and so you brace them and say hey I've got something serious I want to talk to you about and say listen we've worked together for this long period of time so this is reminding them of the value they pride in your life I made you this promise that I want to do
(12:29) this um but I'll get straight to it this business isn't profitable and I can't give you the career growth that I ultimately promised you in the beginning because we're never going to be able to expand and we can't help more people and the mission that I sign signed you on was that we want to make you know this Clark County healthy and we can't do that because I made a mistake and that's on me but and Lea puts this joke in there which is um and uh and unfortunately I can't get fired because I'm the boss so I own the business I still have to be here and so what I want
(12:58) to do is kind of walk you through some of the changes that are going to come down the line so you're going to skip this promises one because you're not getting more money to reinvest right you're going to go here which is um we have to make this change to compensation and you can give them obviously this is going to be a little bit more individual so here's my big disclaimer across the video is that if you have somebody that you have been with for a long time and they have a family kids whatever and you need to make this change then I suggest
(13:24) giving them a period of time and saying hey I'm going to put this change in place in 3 months or 6 months and that way if you need to look for alternative employment you can do that but that gives you some time now I would also have a way where I want you business owner to answer this question what would it take for them to be able to make the same amount of money that they're currently making because often times what has to happen is a resetting of expectations which is there probably is a way that they could make what they're currently
(13:52) making just not doing what they're currently doing and so if you can outline a plan for them which is hey if you do these three things I can get you back to here because this is how it generates enough Revenue in the business so that I can keep this promise to you originally and so basically they have three options option one they can just say I don't want to work more and I'm happy to stay here and that's fine cool option one option two um I'm going to take the three to six months but I'm going to interview with some other people fine option three uh I'm actually
(14:23) going to work more I'm going to take you up on this kind of changing the terms offer and I would like to keep my current current POS you know current compensation and I will take on this extra workload and so uh you can walk them through each of those paths uh but I will also say that you have to be prepared for the fact that some people will leave and so if you recall what I said earlier you want to test this on new customers first right well you also want to test this on new employees first if you put out a job you know job wreck
(14:53) on a job board and you have the new compensation structure in place go recruit somebody go bring someone in go have them do the same job as that other person and if you can attract the same level of talent that meets the standards that you have then you know that you were mispriced you were overcompensated and then you can and then here you can point to precedent right the key is on both of these scenarios it's like you try it with something new you make sure it works and then you can go back and say see I'm not being unreasonable and so from there this also
(15:22) is your insurance for the employees in the business because you say hey if this guy does leave I already hired one or two people so that I can slot them in and so again best case scenario you keep the best talent and you can bring somebody else on and save money on the new people or uh you have to shuffle the whole team out which unfortunately it sucks it also happens and the alternative is you never grow your business and I want I want to be clear if this is almost my always my least favorite of the of the levers that I have to pull I would so much rather
(15:54) solve it by fixing the business model and say like is there a way where we can uh you know increase the price can we get more upsells can we you know do something something like that but where this really gets tough is when you're giving percentages of Revenue because you can't business model fix it because if you go make if you go fix the pricing and fix the up so the person is just getting basically a free raise for no value provided that's where it gets tough so it's less likely when you have someone who's on maybe a salary or someone who's hourly uh that you have to go through this it's just in my
(16:27) experience it's usually when someone is giving someone some sort of Revenue share or profit share on not the whole business and I mean sometimes worst case it's the whole business um but even just like the revenue that they're maybe just delivering on but they're not accountable for any of the other costs associated with it and so that's just like kind of big red flag especially if you're starting out of business I wouldn't recommend doing that um unless this is like they're a partner in the business and it's an equity deal which
(16:50) is just different and also the other exclusion here and this is why you know generic advice is tough um if you have like a brick and mortar location for example having a manager who's getting 10% of profit or something like that if it's on bottom line then that person's incentivized it's fine it's again it's where when when you're taking it off top top line how much sales you get independent of costs that's where it gets tricky I think the reason that so many business struggle with compensation is one just like pricing they just kind of like look around and then just like
(17:20) charge the average um which is not a good way to set up compensation the second is that when you are a smaller business the percentage Revenue that each additional hire is is a huge percentage of the money of your net profit they say your biggest expenses walk on two feet so let's say that you're a business that makes $1 million per year which is great right now let's say you run 25% margins okay so that means that you're making $250,000 per year after all your expenses all right now let's say that you want to hire one employee for $100,000 a year all of a sudden you go
(17:57) from $ 250 to 150 in terms of net income and so this one hire takes up 40% of the profit of your business and so the reason that overhead walks on two legs is that in the beginning your margin for error on hiring because it's one of the most expensive things you can do is very small think about it like this if you were to go sign up for a software for $100,000 a year you would Google consumer affairs you look at every single review you get like seven different demos to make sure that it did exactly what you want but then you hire this person after one conversation you
(18:30) had at lunch because a friend of yours made the introduction it's dumb and so you got to be extra careful especially when you're starting out and what hires you're bringing in and what the true output of increasing profit and bottom line is and so let me put this in one more context for you this person to pay for themselves is going to have to generate $400,000 per year if your margin stay the same just to cover the $100,000 that they cost you and so if you can't see a clear line to how they're going to add $400,000 in Revenue to the business so that after your 25% margins you have the 100,000
(19:09) that's just break even and this is why so many people get stuck yeah and the brutal the brutal truth is uh typically during 1 to three million in Revenue uh we you know Leila and I refer to that as the swamp and it's a swamp because you need to be able to hire that $100,000 your employee but you can't afford to and so you basically have two options you either need to basically kill your profit and bet on the fact that this person's be able to generate that Revenue so they can make up for themselves in growth which realistically means that they should replace almost all the time that you're currently spending on the business so that you can
(19:39) then go rainmate go out there and go hunt and bring more business in or you have to just do that and work two jobs you have to work your current job and the next job and so you basically work overtime and so the first version of this uh you make no money and you bet on the person the second version you stretch yourself thin to be able to create the profit extra so that you can slide that person in without risking the biscuit so number four is overextension which is AKA The Woman in the red dress and so I use this is probably my most used analogy that I have in all the business
(20:13) content I have which is if you're new to the channel if you've seen The Matrix there's a training program where Neo the main character is getting trained on what the Matrix is and so he's walking through and he's walking with Morpheus who's the the guide and he says um were you listening to me or were you looking at the woman in the red dress and he turns around and there's uh he says so look again and so as soon as you looks back at this beautiful woman in the red dress who walked past him while he's going through this training program and not paying attention he looks back and
(20:42) there's a gun point in his face and then morphe says freeze and so he freezes the program he didn't know that he was in a simulation he says if you're not one of us you're one of them and those are agents and so women in the redress look attractive they distract you from the main thing but if if if if it's not one of you if it's not the core business it's something that's been sent to destroy you and so I am so adamant about this particular one because me as an entrepreneur of the of the six that I'm going to go through it's the one that I have struggled the most with um I have I
(21:14) have made so many mistakes with overextension my eyes being bigger than my stomach and I'm 13 14 years into entrepreneurship now and I I honestly feel like I'm still just learning this lesson and so I I share this with you as a as a cautionary tale because you can always especially if you're good at sales you're good at promoting you can sell yourself and you can sell your team on why this time it's different on why it's not a shiny object and why it's such an opportunity and so I want to I want to give you this little lesson that
(21:44) Leela gave me that I just continue to think about over and over again if you look at the things in your business that you want to invest in the things that you stress your team out over are they missed opportunities are they things that you think you should be doing but you aren't or are they problems are they things that you that you've promised but you're not delivering as well as you should have and if you want to have uh a great framework around this which I will give to you is you will grow bigger by
(22:09) getting better you will not grow bigger by choosing to get bigger when you choose to get bigger you will get bloated and so you grow through Improvement I have this this Frame that I've just been working on that's probably I'm make a whole podcast about it but I'll give you the the the quick and dirty if you want to make something valuable fundamentally you have the promise or the claim that you have so you say hey I'm going to help you with XYZ if people say I want that that is all you need you now have a valuable
(22:39) claim all right everything after this point is removing friction and so you have to think what are the things that make this suck delay makes this suck effort that they now have to do this is new things they have to do that they don't want to do as a result of the purchase sacrifice what are the things that they have to stop doing that they wish they could keep doing as a result of the purchase risk which is what risk do I now have to incur so B2B for example if you have to start spending money on ads that's a new risk that you have to incur if you start with an
(23:10) agency on top of the agency itself if you have a a travel uh membership where people go to houses it's like well they now have to travel for flights they have to spend money on airfare which is not core to that membership but it's additional risk and the last one which is still technically under risk but I like to pull it out is inconsistency so if you're thinking about okay if I said I can get you this this thing this outcome all the things that make it suck are the delay the effort the sacrifice the risk and the inconsistent sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't work my Wi-Fi is spotty my like what makes you
(23:43) hate your cell phone the most if 95% of the time your cell phone worked and 5% it didn't you would hate your cell phone you would literally hate it if one out of 20 times it wasn't working you check your phone 20 times an hour if once an hour your phone didn't work you would want to throw it against the wall and so a phone is an amazing product imagine all the things we can do but just having that little 5% inconsistency and the business owner of the phone's like what are they talking about this thing does the internet it does this it does that
(24:08) but just one out of 20 times you want to kill somebody and so the Charlie Monger had this quote which I love which is the new business is sitting on your desk in front of you it's the work in front of you that's where the next customer comes from and so I have I have shifted my focus as an entrepreneur from what are these opportunities that I think I'm missing out on two how do I just make the thing that I currently have better and it's so painful because it's not fun everything new is exciting it's the woman in the red dress she walks by she gets all your attention and the thing is is that it's because you don't know her backstory you don't know
(24:46) the crazy ex-boyfriend you don't know that she has chlamydia you don't know all of these other things but everything looks good when it's at a nightclub and it's kind of dark and you're a little bit buzzed right but the next morning you're like oh my God there's some crazy boyfriend knocking on the door she's actually not single and oh my God why is it burned when I pee and you've got all these other issues that come with it because you didn't know and so you have uninformed optimism when you're looking
(25:11) at missed opportunities you have rosecolor glasses because all you see now are the problems in your business and you're like this thing would solve all my problems this girl is the dream girl I had it all wrong but it's not and I'm telling you I've been so deceived by this girl so many times which is why I'm making this is that you just have to keep looking and be like maybe the reason that business isn't growing is because I'm just not good enough is that it's taking too long for my people to get results it's too much work for them it's too much sa they have to stop doing the stuff they like it's too risky for
(25:41) them to incur this and I'm not consistent and if you use this as like what are all the things that are that are fall into these buckets and what you do is you make your list one by one and you go to your team and you say all right these are all the things that are messed up about our product let's solve number one and we're going to keep on number one until we solve it and once we solve number one we're going to go to number two and so if you're curious about what the iPhone is the iPhone is what's left after you remove
(26:10) everything that sucks from a phone and so you think about Steve Jobs in creating valuable products it's very difficult to know what is value but it's very easy to know what's a problem and when you remove all problems what you're left with is value fifth problem that [ __ ] small business owners and this is a big one all right so if you're like more than one business isn't that the woman in the red dress the answer is yes so everything I just said applies to that one overextension is what I need to actually cover so overextension is where
(26:39) you grow for the sake of growing sake and so that's when you have one location and then you think oh okay I finally have this one going I'm going to open a second location but as soon as you open your second location all of a sudden the profit from your first location drops and so then what happens is now you're doing twice the amount of work as you were doing before but you're making the same amount of money and then you think okay well now this is the model this is where this is the this is stasis so I'm
(27:02) open a third location and so then you open a third location and both of your first two locations go down just a little bit more and so now you're working at three locations doing three times the work but now you make zero dollar in profit and anytime you've unexpected expense it comes out of your pocket and so you're like how did I get here you got here because of overextension and so overextension is actually as a two-prong problem number one is is entrepreneurs have arbitrary timelines so and I so funny I talked to a lot and I asked them what their goals
(27:32) are and often times the you know they the guys who are at uh you know 10K month say they want to get to 30 guys at 30 say they want to get to 100 guys at 100 say they want to get to 200 guys at you know 200 say they want to get to a million whatever right everybody just just does whatever the next Notch is and so what's interesting is that although that is a is a it's a noble goal there's nothing wrong with making more money all for it is that you want to be good enough to earn the growth more than say I will demand the growth by just
(28:01) forcing more Revenue through the business by just adding [ __ ] on and this can either be through adding products that you shouldn't be selling or adding service lines that you don't need to or in the brick and mortar example starting to add locations before you're ready now if you're like well how do I know I'm ready so the litmus test that I have I'll give you the brick-and mortar one but you can translate it uh pretty much in any business is that the business has to go for six months without you and it has to
(28:30) maintain or grow in that period of time and so a lot of people think especially if you're a smaller business owner and you're getting to this point where you're like oh I'm starting to grow is because you remove yourself from delivery and maybe sales and you're like my business makes money without me you've just never been a manager or director or an operator before but you probably work almost every hour of every day and somehow you're not selling and you're also not delivering then what are you doing all day you're absolutely working you're just in a higher leverage
(28:59) job and so to think that oh this business runs without me well no because if you're not there it goes to [ __ ] it just the customers you're no longer customer facing doesn't mean that you don't work anymore like imagine imagine what a big Fortune 100 company that all of a sudden the entire seae leaves and says oh well this business runs without me it would very quickly crater because no one is setting the objectives no one's setting priorities no one's driving accountability throughout the organizations no one's aligning resources to getting outcomes and so of
(29:28) course what you do is still important and of course what you're doing is still work and so the trade that I I give I walk people through this uh emotionally I say this so if you want your location to work right and you want to pass this liit test here's the first and easy one go on vacation for two to four weeks and just say I'm turning my phone off okay that's that's level one test level two test is that after someone passes level one you go to the manager of your location or whatever and you say hey I'm going to give you the opportunity to be
(29:58) a co-owner in this business okay over the next however many years uh you're going to get 2% a year for the next five years up to 10% cool and I'll give you the profit share now and you can get the equity later whatever I'm not going to get in the deal structure but you say here's the deal you get this profit this phone doesn't ring that's the trade and so let's role play it a pipe bursts what do you do if your first inclination is call me that's not the deal what do you think I'm going to do I'm going to call a plumber and that's what you should do
(30:31) and so I have a a mentor uh my godfather um who said this to me and I just love this so I called him once out of the blue and um he said what's wrong is everything okay that's how he answered the phone and I was like yeah everything's fine um he's like so it's not an emergency I was like no he's like then why are you calling me and so basically he's like if you said it's an emergency call 911 if it's not an emergency why are you calling me and so either way don't call me and so we were we were playing tongue and- cheek he's a
(31:01) great guy that's not the point but the point is when you're having the discussion with somebody to truly delegate you have to be able to give the control away otherwise you don't pass the test that's if you have a brick and mor location where you need to nail the model before you scale it if you have a call it service-based business then you want to get the economics of your core business working such that you do have a profit and so if you're not profitable and then you say oh I'll then add something else on top in order to become profitable I don't think that's the right solution unless since day one
(31:35) you're like oh I'm going to sell soda and burgers and sodas where I make my money that's a little bit different but if you need to sell something else in order to be profitable there's something wrong with your core business and you should just fix that rather than try to add more and more stuff to your already failing business and so if you're curious like what's the solve to this overextension let me tell you what the solve is it's three letters w h o who typically you have a who problem if you want to do this expansion you want to open the next location you want to do
(32:10) this new product line or service line you typically need to have a who who either owns that new thing while you can maintain the current thing or who can take over the current thing so that you can grow and take on the new thing but in either instance overextension occurs when you don't have a good enough who and then you decide to do it anyways and that's because of greed there's no like there's really no other there's really no other one or Envy because you're competing with somebody else and you think that you just arbitrarily need to increase your
(32:41) increase how much revenue because it fills some hole inside of you which I'm all for Success filling that hole but uh at least do it well the amount of overextension I saw at gym launch is was is second to none we'd fix a gym and then literally like I had this happen lovely lady named um um was two months from closing her gym signs up for gym launch 30 days later she's got a full gym and in 90 days from the time that she signed up which remember is two days from her shutting two two months away from her shutting her doors she then signs another lease for a second
(33:15) location and I was like in what world did you think that was a good idea she's like well I'm already full it's like yeah but you you've just been full for the first time ever and you had to hire new trainers which aren't who you didn't train and you have all these backend processes you don't even know what your conversion on the back end is going to be you don't even know your what your turn rates are you have no I'm it's I'm I'm going to give foreshadowing for the next the next problem right um You have
(33:40) no insert next problem you have to get this stuff in place you have to stabilize the business and so a lot of people they they like they struggle struggle struggle they see one thing is success and they immediately think oh I'm I'm therefore I'm successful I'm 10 Xing and if you measure on a longer time Horizon you feed your ego in the short term and you empty your bank account in the long term which brings us to drum please uh big risk number six which is no this a big one wait for it no data daddy wait why is Daddy included I don't know you guys are weird but no data daddy is the problem this is the the
(34:19) thing that syncs the business and so let me I want to describe what it feels like when you don't have data if you were constantly confused if you don't know what you should do you typically don't have data you have no tracking in place you don't know where your customers come from you don't know what your sales conversion rate is you don't know what percentage your customers stay after X period of time you don't know what your turn is you don't know what your gross margins are and so you're trying to make these decisions with no data and you feel like you're an idiot but you're not
(34:49) I can't make decisions without data no one can I mean you can you're just guessing and the thing is is that guessing is a pretty bad way of making decisions it basically states that rolling a dice is the most effective way to get an outcome and it certainly isn't if you have a goal and so I mean you will get an outcome it just probably won't be the one you want it's assuming Randomness is better than thought and so if your thoughts are so poor that Randomness is better then entrepreneurship is never going to work out for you anyways all right and so I bring this up just to say that if you
(35:19) don't know what to do data first and the reason that entrepreneurs get stuck here remember I talk about the rock in the hard play scenario is that they feel like they need to make more money they feel like they need to be making more profit they feel like they need to get more leads all of these things right and this feels non Revenue generating and so you think well I got to go get I got to go make this money uh and the short-term pain is oh I got to go collect a bunch of stuff and like get get attribution in place I got to like have an Excel sheet that like I got to get my team to like say how many people
(35:48) walked in today or how many clicks we got to the website or what our conversion rate is on our Pages well God that's going to take so much time but I need to do this rock in a hard place I can promise you you're never going to scale with that data it's never going to happen but you can absolutely maintain your very very terrible existence for a very long period of time without any dat and you're always wondering what's going on wondering when the next shoe's going to drop wondering where your next lead's going to come from and what's
(36:12) astonishing is when I had Al in the software company we had these T t-shirts that said data is dope um and data is dope because you'd be amazed at how intelligent people will perceive you to be based on the quality of your decisions when you have high quality data because decisions tend to become very easy when you have data if you know that one Revenue stream generates 80% of your revenue and the other one's 20 and it's 80% of your effort what do you do well obviously you do this one yeah but people don't do that why because they don't have the data to see that if you have one one
(36:40) channel where you're getting the most profitable and best customers from and you've got another one that you spend 80% of your time on and You' be like well obviously I'll put my attention where yeah but you don't know that and so this is the thing is is like you will look like a genius from the outside but you're just making Common Sense decisions and so most of business growth is common sense the problem is that most people don't do the first and obvious thing of Common Sense which is collect data track and so I I I used to tell this to the sales team and I actually
(37:10) used it from when I had weight loss customers I said if you don't track you don't care and it's just like one of the easy like you don't record your sales calls you don't care if you don't track what your Clos rates are you don't care if you don't track what your profit is you don't care and so I'm going to I'm going to give you a term right now that I I want you to write down if you're uh if you're at home which is measurement as inter vention and so there's been countless studies done on this but I'll give the simple one which is in weight loss if you want to help someone lose weight you
(37:47) can truly tell them nothing besides just getting them to weigh themselves every day and when people weigh themselves every day they lose weight wild if you track your profit every month guess what will happen your profit will improve if you track your closeth rate and you weren't tracking it it will improve because you will be able to use common sense because you able to see oh when I did these on these sales calls my close rate went up because you track it and so if you want to improve any component of the business the first step
(38:22) is measure and so I can't it's I mean I'm embarrassed to say some of the size business businesses that I've seen $5 million a year sometimes $10 million a year who barely have simple data and so if you're like well what data should I collect because there's so much data that's out there so let me answer that question you want to collect the pipeline and that goes from click to close all right this is the first pipeline that you need to track which is at every point of conversion I've got a you know what's my ctrr on my ads are my
(38:52) content how much track traffic am I getting what's my opt-in rate what's my schedule rate what's my show rate what's my offer rate what's my close rate what's my cash collected all of these those are all the metrics you track but that's one funnel you have another funnel that goes from close to resell which is okay now that I've closed somebody what's the likelihood that they buy again or Ascend into something else and so we're going to have what's our activation what's our time to Value what's our what's churn what's what's grow gross profit per
(39:21) product line what are Ascension rates by cohort meaning what types of customers choose what types of products and so you want to have like if you had to do one you do this one if you got two I would say do this one if you had to do three then I would start looking more front end in terms of channels like where are my leads coming from and so one of these is probably the problem in your business start tracking that one first and if if you have problems on all of these then track them all and that is
(39:48) the first objective because from there you can then actually improve it and tracking itself and to rewind to the um to the to the irrational belief of well well I have to do this Revenue generating activity I can't take time to do this data getting the data May in and of itself already solved the problem for you because you actually started paying attention to it so as promised at the beginning those are the six Horsemen that plague businesses on a regular basis I want to then translate this into the real world by walking through a real example of a portfolio company uh over a year of
(40:27) the data of this specific business now I'm only going to share the backend data because I did a different uh breakdown on a YouTube video of the frontend data of this business that we turned around and so the first thing that we collected was profit so the profit of the business at the time before it's 5% that's a terrible five there we go 5% Revenue retention was around 2% might as well be zero and then you have ascensions which is what percentage of customers and these are interrelated obviously because if you
(41:00) ascend customers they're more likely to keep paying you by the way Pro tip if you sell someone something else they are more likely to pay you uh and so they were getting zero to one per month and this was a company that was selling you know tens if not just under a 100 units a month so like this this business had um volume right so let's walk through what we did to unfuck this business so let's list out the problems and you'll recall that the problems will not manifest the way I described all right so this is be this will be how you can merge the reality with the theory uh
(41:34) behind the problems all right so the first thing is we got churn and to be clear this is team churn not customer turn this is employee turn so people were leaving second was no data that one's actually word for word the exact same thing as the front next is no Revenue retention so people weren't staying and paying a year later and then no ascensions people weren't buying again again now originally you'd think maybe this product sucked um but we felt really confident that it didn't because the people who were buying were happy with it and so we're like okay there's some sort of misconnect which is usually
(42:07) what I'm good at fixing so let's start with the employee turn so they had two issues that were big ones so number one is that they were actually the reverse of the other situation they were actually underpaying and because they were underpaying they couldn't get good calent into the business and I'll say often times this is more common than the undercompensation issue that I referenced earlier it's just that this one's easy to fix the overcompensation problem is significantly harder because you got to pull something back that was once there and so what happens is when you underpay people one is you're going
(42:39) to get underqualified people and if you do get qualified people they'll often just take side work or second jobs in order to make a full income for themselves and then you really have half of an employee and so uh not ideal and so both of those situations that occurred within the specific business and the other problem with this underpayment is that they had a poor leader and so they had this was specifically over the delivery department and so that poor leader uh ended up Believe It or Not uh trying to push the entire department against the
(43:10) founder uh and pit them against them and almost blew up the entire business and so we would consider this an existential risk so those were the problems let's talk about the solutions so number one is we hired a new uh CS leader unsurprisingly somebody who's more experienced that didn't hate the founder you'd be amazed at what happens when you take out people who hate the founder and hate the business and it turns out that businesses grow better when the people don't hate them who work there um the
(43:36) second thing we did and this is in lock step with what we're just saying is we actually fired 90% of the Baseline team and that was because we had hired the wrong people um and they were those basically cop was too low it attracted the wrong people those people were bad and we didn't think we could upskill them and it basically wasn't worth the resources we'd have to deploy in order to fix it and so it's like hey it would be faster for us to just restart and reboot this department number three is that with a reboot we hired super aggressively uh to
(44:06) backfill aggro hiring having a good CS leader requires a number of things so this type of person tends to be more operational focused they're good with details they're good at remembering things um they love customers and their focus is on value creation and so the opposite of that is if your head of Cs blames customer customers on a consistent basis complaining is not a strategy nor is blaming customers because neither of those make you better and basically taking zero accountability for customer outcomes and typically they are the type of people who also blame
(44:42) team for a lack of outcomes as well and so basically you've just got a big victim like a true CS leader is a leader they are accountable they hold themselves accountable they hold the team accountable and ultimately they want to deliver value and that's all you want someone who's customer obsessed who like when you're about to say hey I think we should do this thing they're an advocate for the customer on now obviously not to the degree that they're like hey we should go out of business give everything away for free no but you should have somebody
(45:10) who's got a heart for that and more is aligned with the idea that hey if these guys like if we can get them to pay more we can give them more even more value because they believe in the product and they believe in the company now a good Telltale sign of a CS leader is that they're they're immediately willing to jump in roll their sleeves up and talk to customers not to say that's their full-time job or that they're going to do that like they're going to be taking CS calls as their main thing but especially if you're going to try and turn around a department and sometimes
(45:35) this is you you got to hop in there you got to talk to your customers so you can understand what's going on right and so you know Steve Jobs like the best entrepreneurs in the world still always do this you're never too big to talk to your customers so the next thing is is after we hired the new CS leader he did an assessment of the team and saw that the majority of them were lacking skills and he determined that it would not be worth the resources to try and train these people now he didn't then say great now let's fire them all and screw the business that wasn't actually what
(46:03) happened so think about it like this um let's say you've got a pot right with water and this water is really diluted so it's empty right so what he did was he said hey I'm going to add more green dye into here and when I add that green dye I'm going to have like a light green Hue and so he brought in some good people at new and better compensation who had more experience doing doing this particular CS role that was a better fit for this business and now we had some good people and some bad people but the good people were so
(46:36) clearly the ones who were driving the outcome willing to work harder willing to roll up their sleev cared about the customers that one of two things happened a lot of these uh empty empty water the diluted water uh exited voluntarily they said you know what this isn't for me anymore I don't want to work this much blah blah blah blah blah and then what ended up happening is that long term the entirety of the team basically became became these new people that we got in and so because of that we're able to shift the entire concentration of the team without disrupting the business and and to be clear that means for a short period we
(47:08) had to pay two teams we had to pay the old team that sucked and the new team that was good who would then jump in and then the bad team which we already knew were bad were happy to slack a little bit more and so then it's basically what what a lot of employees don't realize is that they think that if someone else comes in and makes their job option leete it means that they're getting a free check but what it really is it's the warning sign that you're on the way out the door you just don't know it someone's covering for you before you get fired and so the next question that might naturally come up is like well shoot how did they hire aggressively so
(47:42) in terms of ordering probably is three and then two so apologies there in terms of the sequence of my little notes here um but in terms of hiring aggressively number one is we increased comp so we paid people better and so what do you know more people responded to the job post responded to the reach outs um we looked for csms with experience so these were people who had already done a job like this at a company of this size before for this type of product crazy crazy and we were looking for three plus years for this particular um for this
(48:11) particular business and the third thing that we did was we increased Benny's not Benjamin's uh but benefits all right so we gave them uh pay time off and we added you know full compensation benefits on top of uh the salary and the money you know the cial compensation and so basically we just made an irresistible offer a grand slam offer if you will but to higher employees and so if you are struggling right now to fill up a new team or you have a constraint in the business you're like I need to hire new sales guys or I need to have
(48:40) more CS or I need to have more whatever right and you're not getting a lot of lead gen you just got to look at your offer you got to look at the you got to look at like an ad it's like what's the headline what's the what's the comp what's the you know is it remote or in person is it full-time is it parttime what are the working hours uh what are the benefits what are the expect ations and you have to make sure that it's reasonable if you asking for 10 years of experience and you're starting somebody's salary at at 50k it's
(49:03) probably unlikely that like for almost any role it's really unlikely that you're going to get somebody and so you need to make sure that you're matching the requirements to the compensation a good question that will come up around CS or customer success or customer service is do you compensate them around ascensions or renewals um it really depends on the business and so if there's a call it a sale that's involved uh where they have to get on the phone and like sell a customer into it there's typically going to be some sort of compensation there if it's something that happens more automatically in the background they might have a percentage
(49:33) of a book of business I generally don't like that um I've noticed that people tend to get a little bit complacent uh when they just have like recurring Revenue that they're not really responsible for and so um if there's if it's more sales heavy then typically there will be a commission if it's less sales heavy I would advise against it so the first problem that we saw was Employee turn so let's check that puppy so now let's move on to no data no data daddy zero data for me to tell you all the data they didn't know I mean there's unlimited amounts of data that they
(50:03) could potentially collect but I'll just give you some of the The Hot List all right so this is just directly from my notes so they didn't know what their engagement rates were they didn't have any customer satisfaction or NPS scores they didn't even know the date that customers were starting um they didn't have throughput on the funnel uh in terms of what closers are doing well they didn't so they didn't have closed rates by closer um they didn't even have a grand new le like to the week um customer segments were not existent as
(50:27) in we didn't see like what types of customers are buying what types aren't um we didn't know what our refund rates were uh we didn't know what payment plans looked like in terms of managing cash flow in the business like we didn't know what churn was we didn't know what Ascension rates were we didn't know what the time to Value was we didn't know what activation points were like I could keep going they basically they didn't didn't know a lot about about their own business you'd be amazed at how easy some of the things that you can do are once you see what the problems are because the thing is that the data will
(50:52) scream at you it will become patently obvious like if you're not making money the data will will obviously show you why you're not making the first thing we did was we wanted to fix the front end stats around sales because remember I said click the close you got to get that and so I talked about that at more length in a different video but we figured out close rates in General close rates by closer close rates by time period um and by cohort all right so we got that stuff off the bat done now the second set of problems with this is more backend related uh was related to customer you know CS right and so um
(51:22) number one is we looked at time to Value like was there some sort of Milestone that we could help them achieve sooner in their customer Journey the second was tto which is time to onboarding okay so how quickly from the time someone purchases until they're live or active this is one of the easiest ways that you can drive value like how are these different well sometimes the time to Value happens after the onboarding sometimes it happens during the onboarding sometimes you have multiple points of value but this one obviously has to happen as fast as humanly
(51:50) possible so time to value is going to be typically an activation point and so an activation point is some sort of activity that occurs that is a high correlation with them staying or paying later and so if you're like well how do I know that the easiest way to do that is look at the people who are currently staying in paying and look at what they did earlier and then try and reverse engineer that outcome for everyone and so for example if you find out that uh you know customers who join a gym uh and attend three workouts a week for their first uh actually I think Orange Theory
(52:21) they actually figured out their activation point which was five workouts in the first month and so when they found out that one metric was that if someone worked out five times in the first month the likely that they'd stay for the next like eight was significantly higher and so then all of their onboarding process was then geared towards driving that activation point and by the way this is most of what onboarding is and this is why data so important if you knew for example that every customer who gets their first you
(52:46) know one sale so for gym launch like we knew that if somebody got a $22,000 sale at a gym within their first seven days they were worth three times more to us as as a business owner and so what do you think we did we did everything in our power to get the $2,000 sale in the first seven days that's what we did and so it becomes You' be like well what do you do it's like well once you have the data it becomes pretty obvious what you do right you try and do more of that thing that worked and so this is this is where like the the the extra brain cell
(53:09) the second brain cell has to turn on and this is where you say what are all my successful customers look like what did they do and then how do I get all my customers to do that on purpose instead of on accident if you're very sales-oriented or promotional founder like if I if you take one thing from this whole video it's that you want to create a really beautiful onboarding process like if you had only one thing to take away it would be onboarding like you fix turn through onboarding and a lot of this is expectation setting relative to goals and so sales hands off
(53:40) a customer to a customer success and in the onboarding you want to restate their goals multiple times so that they know that you know what their goals are and then you tie their goals to the actions or activities that you want them to take which typically should be aligned with the time to value and so think about it like this in General most businesses that are well-designed should have their value creation which is what they get paid for aligned with the customer value creation and so you in a very beautiful
(54:07) way have an aligned incentive with the customer if they want to make money because you're B2B then you want to make them money too and you should clearly state in order for us to have you hit this goal you need to do these five things and when you do these five things it increases the likely that this money occurs and if this money occurs it means that it's more likely that you pay me and that you stay happy so the next thing that we looked at the next thing that we had to start tracking was customer engagement and so customer engagement is in a software setting it
(54:32) would be usage which is you know how frequently are people commenting inside of the group are they attending calls are they attending their check-ins with their reps are there Milestones or achievements um all of these things are things that indicate engagement and so the shorthand for customer engagement is use are they using it because I mean think about the logical extreme if someone doesn't use anything they're going to turn and if someone uses it all the time it's less likely they're going to turn and so figuring out what the activation point is is looking at all of
(55:03) the things people use and figuring out what few things they use that have the highest correlation with staying and so if you have 10 things that customers could potentially do in the business there might be three of them that are the ones that are the core value creators which then have the highest correlate with them actually staying long term and I'll give you a little a little a little Advanced business tip for you A lot of times if you want to improve the quality of a product product or service it actually comes from deletion not addition and so as humans we often want to overd deliver in value
(55:33) and so we think oh we need to add more stuff but the number one reason that people cancel or turn across across Industries is overwhelm there's too much stuff to do and so the result of that is what are all of the things that we can remove and so I'll give you a very tactical way to do this I want you to write out a list of every single feature that you have in your services now when you actually do this you'll realize that you have a lot more things that you give people than you realize you probably have downloads you might have calls you might have events you might have uh you
(56:03) might have some sort of chat support you might have all you also have the core deliverable you have all these things that you do put a big list out and then ask them this magical question if I got rid of everything except one thing which would you want to keep and so you have that list below and when when people are forced to say like if you could only keep one thing what would it be you will have a very clear idea of the things that drive the most value now you might you might initially think oh everyone's going to pick this
(56:58) just send the survey and you will be surprised some people stay for very different reasons but it will give you a power ranking of one two and three that are the most valuable and then if you want to go to the 301 Advanced business move look at the one that was the lowest value and then remove it and don't tell people you remove it just remove it and see who complains and if no one complains congratulations you just got to make the same money for doing less and if people do complain look at who's complaining and are they the types of businesses or customers that you want to
(57:29) serve and so sometimes you will get some complainers but they may be the worst customers that you've been planning on getting rid of anyways and you're like great let's get rid of them too why not and so um I'll give you a little story about this so I ran this survey uh at gym launch years ago and we had a lot of things that we were doing for our customers and one of them is that we had real-time tech support and so we had a 35 person team that did tech support for the gym owners because it's one of the one of the biggest obstacles people kind
(57:58) of encounters they're not good with like how do I install pixel how do I make a landing page all that kind of stuff the lowest one of the lowest ranked things was this tech support team and I after seeing it I was like oh my God this is a massive department so I interviewed a couple customers and they were like yeah I don't really care either way like that's not the the main the main value driver and so I deleted the department which is a very nice way of saying that I released people to free free agency 35
(58:23) it was terrible was honestly it was a horrible experience um um but here's what happened to our churn and our sales nothing they added no value and so Carl icon tells a story about this where he bought a company and there was an entire building in a state and I can't remember what state it was and it was like 11 stories of just this company just like one one huge you know division of this business and he said he he spent months analyzing trying to figure out what anyone did there and he would go there and they would turn him six ways to Sunday and say all the work that they do was important and he was like I'm a
(58:57) pretty smart guy and I have no idea what you're doing and so he went to one of the factories and he asked one of the foremans he's like you know about these guys and he was like dude just get rid of them they don't do anything and so after months and months and months he decided to get rid of the entire 11 floors he did he fired everyone and he said the weirdest thing happened nothing he said I didn't even get an email this was an entire a whole building full of people who actually did nothing and so
(59:23) the thing is is that we as entrepreneurs often times think to have to solve problems we add bodies and then bodies tend to multiply because other people tend to try and solve solutions by just saying I'll hire more people and this is where it gets even dumber is that one people hire people stupider than them in general as a rule of thumb because they feel like they're in control and they're not threatened which means that your organization over time just gets dumber and dumber and so you have to have
(59:45) controls in place to prevent that and number two so what happens is everyone delegates their workload to dumber and dumber people so it's like the director gets something from a CEO and then and says okay I'm just going to delegate that to the manager and then the manager gets in and says I'm going to delegate it to the Frontline employee and then the Frontline employee says hey I need support because I can't do all this work and then hires someone new and then delegates it to them and so what was supposed to be an incredibly important
(1:00:08) thing just gets done by the most incompetent person in the business and that happens all the time and so to prevent against that consistently asking your customers where the value is being provided is an excellent way to determine whether or not values being provided so the next thing that we started to track was cessat or so cat is customer satisfaction uh CAD for short or NPS which is net promoter score so these are the two scores that uh acquisition.
(1:00:33) comom uses most frequently in terms of uh to determine uh how well you know product is delivering to its customers and um NPS is the less forgiving of the two and so I would weit rate that higher and so for those you who don't know how NPS score works it's a uh it's a it's a negative 100 to a positive 100 score so it's not a 0 to 100 so Zero's in the middle and I think the average company has like a -2 uh in terms of score just to give you context and so uh you ask people How likely are you to refer a friend to this business and uh basically the answers go 10
(1:01:04) through you know one and anything that is a six or below is considered a negative one crazy someone gives you a six it's a negative 1 seven and8 are both zeros and then only 9 and 10 are plus one and so in order to get a 100 that means every single one of the customers that you survey has to rate you over an eight you cannot not get anyone who's even a seven like a seven would be a zero and so would it would detract from your 100 a six would be you'd have one of those plus ones would be counted against and so uh it's one of the most sensitive scores but because of that I think it's one of the most
(1:01:41) accurate um because it's such a hypothetical ideal it's so hard it's basically like to give you context apple has a 61 all right so it's a very very sensitive score um and so like Chick-fil-A is a 58 just to give you a context here in terms of like some exceptional business is and how hard it is and this is why I like this score because you can kind of pump yourself up with customer satisfaction scores but NPS because it has the negatives and how it weights is a very good way to understand um how good you're actually doing the next one is Ascension rates so
(1:02:11) this is what percentage of customers who buy the first thing go to the second thing and you can do it by two two metrics here you do qualified ascensions which is what percentage of customers who were qualified to ascend then ascended and what percentage of total customers um in toal Ascend this is more valuable to understand how well you're doing this is more valuable to understand how the economics of the business work and so if you know that let's say uh you know 80% of customers who are qualified Ascend but you're only ascending 10% of customers then it means
(1:02:41) we might be selling too many unqualified customers or we might not be doing well enough on our initial core product to get them to the point of being qualified and so having both of these metrics gives you a a paired idea of a quantity and quality metric so the next one that we prioritized uh was was churn and you if you've been on this channel you should know what churn is by now but I will I'll I'll give you the quick and dirty so churn percentage is what percentage customers from last month are still here this month and so if I had 100 customers last month and I've got 95 of those 100 that are still here my turn
(1:03:12) is 5% now if I sold 10 more clients that doesn't matter it's how many of the original customers I had last month are still here one month one month later now 5% may seem good to you but here's what's crazy if you want to see what percentage of customers you keep every year if you have 5% monthly turn you're going to lose over half of your customers every year which means you have to sell half the year just to break even on your growth very hard to out sell bad turn turn varies a lot by industry by the nature of the product and obviously the quality of the product like there's lower turn in alarm systems than there
(1:03:46) is in online groups right and so uh you know there's lower turn in you know internet providers there's there's a lot of industries that just have that are more prone to stickiness and they tend to be honestly uh products that work without the customer doing anything and so think about what what products are like that so like Insurance Works without you doing anything your solar roof Works without you doing anything your Wi-Fi works without you doing anything your your your cell phone carrier works without you doing anything
(1:04:10) and so they call this in the software word magical products it's like they you only notice when they're not working and so those are wonderful products to be able to build whenever you see those types of opportunities but for this particular business it required work on behalf of the customer so it's naturally going to have higher turn uh but this was one of the big things that we had to be able to start tracking because guess when you start tracking it it starts getting better if you want to use turn as a benchmark you can just Google uh industry Benchmark turn
(1:04:33) 4X um and you'll usually get some sort of stats that'll be decent at least it'll give you directional data um and also just talking to competitors talking to other people you know trade conferences things like that can give you very good data of like oh you know what I have 5% ger but everyone's at 15 so I'm actually doing okay um now I don't care too much I want to like just put this out there I don't care too much about everyone else does because like I just want to win and so if I'm like winning by a lot i' just still rather win by more um so the next one is uh and
(1:04:58) the last one was client goals and so this uh was important because so the next thing we tracked was was customer goals so this is a qualitative data point and this should be something that is one captured on the sales call it's also reminded or reiterated on the onboarding call it should be something that's updated on a regular basis because client goals change and so we want to make sure that all of the people who are touching the customer weirdos um know what the current goal of the customer is and so if you're doing a good job you might help them accomplish this goal so you might have to set
(1:05:27) another goal and so if you remember the whole point of of getting someone motivated to take any kind of action is you have to create some sort of deprivation between where they are and where they want to be right so they want to be up here celebrating yay right and they're over here and they sad faces is that we just have to like as soon as they get happy be like no no no you should be sad even though we cut your turn from 10% to 5% you should be at two and a half percent right you just keep moving the goal post just like you do for yourself just do it for them so uh
(1:05:52) no Daya Daddy no we are actually not fatherless we indeed have a father father we have father data so next we have uh basically no renewals we have no Revenue retention so if I looked at 100 customers this year and I looked at 100 customers next year the likel that they' be the same people is zero no one no one is renewing so that's obviously an issue because think about like this if you have a business that you don't renew any customers here I'll I'll walk you through a visual example so let's say you've got two businesses all right and you've got you know year one year two
(1:06:22) and year three and let's say at the end of year three both of these businesses have 300 active customers okay now business one uh loses 100% of its customers every year that means that year one it sells 100 customers year two it has to sell 200 customers and then year three in order to have three 300 it has to sell all 300 that year so in order to scale that business you just have to scale acquisition you have to get more leads you have to get more salesman and you just have to keep scaling the front end
(1:06:53) now let's look at business 2 so business too and let's say that they sell 100 as well but they have 100% customer uh annual renewal so next year they sell plus 100 but they have 200 customers total and then the third year they have plus 100 but they have 300 customers total so both of these businesses have 300 customers three years later but which business would you rather have well I'll tell you which one I would rather have I would rather have this one because I know that if I just keep doing this I'm just going to keep being able to grow this business to grow this business I know that at year four in order to grow I'm going to lose all 300
(1:07:27) of these and I got to sell 400 customers next year just just to grow a little bit just to grow by 25% and so this is why when you're building a business everybody's in a rush but being in a rush is what ensures that it takes much longer for you and so you you're you're here you're losing all your customers but you learned how to sell congratulations but by doing that you never solve the main problem and then that problem that churn issue that Revenue retention issue will become a monster that in the beginning it's a little little nibble but then it just bigger and bigger and bigger and you don't want to feed that monster so the
(1:07:58) reason that they had no Revenue attention beyond the fact they didn't even track it was that they had no script for how their customer interaction should should be they had no prioritization of customers overall the uh there these conversations were having at random not on any sort of cadence ascensions were ad hoc meaning basically only if a customer reached out to them and said hey can I buy the other thing they're like oh yeah sure but there was no journey to drive people towards that that outcome so this is what we did to fix it and so for the purpose of this I'm going
(1:08:32) to break renewals and ascensions into two different things renewals are they buy the same thing again ascensions are they buy something even either more quality or more quantity all right and so for the renewal process uh we did number one we started tracking time to value and so crazy is if you actually provide more value to people faster and you track it they are happier the second thing is that we contextualized uh conversation so um we had notes on every customer we installed a note system basically so that every time a rep would talk to a customer they had the history of the customer's past conversations and
(1:09:06) so one of the easiest ways to piss off a customer is to have them repeat themselves and so as I was alluding to earlier you want to think about all the stuff that sucks about an experience and remove all the friction and so repeating yourself would be friction and so if you want to have an exceptional experience just remove everything that sucks the third thing we did is we reframed the renewal in the context of their goals so basically we're like hey you want this big goal renewing is the way that you get there and so a lot of people didn't know that it sounds silly but
(1:09:34) like we didn't say hey your goal is this this gets you to your goal you should buy it just as simple as that is and all of these things build in each other so when you have the time to Value you know what you're driving everyone towards when you have the notes then you can talk to them and personalize the experience that they're having on a regular Cadence and then when we have the context and we know where we're driving them towards then we can speak in terms of their goals to get them to be more likely to renew
(1:09:56) and then finally here's the brilliant one we said when and where have they renewed most frequently in the past and it turned out for this business that they would have these Live Events every so often and at the Live Events they had a huge amount of renewals that would happen and we said what if instead of having these happen on accident we had them happen on purpose instead of them happening randomly we had them happen regularly and so when we did that we got way more people to regularly Ascend by
(1:10:21) driving them to the highest converting event that we had for renewals and so think about it instead of saying like hey we're going to have a customer appreciation event once a year maybe you do one once a quarter and you actually choreograph the event a little bit so that you have a sales outcome and so survey says for Revenue retention huz that's what we did all right so for this particular business for Ascension so I just covered how we got every people who were buying called six to 12 months of service to buy another six or 12 months
(1:10:45) of service the second part was can we get them to ascend to a higher uh level of service for this business and so their Ascension process was just as disorganized Andor non-existent as the renewal process so there was no script there was no prioritization of customers that we thought these ones would be a good fit these ones wouldn't be a good fit it was random and and at the at the point that we started decide to fix this all ascensions what 100% of ascensions came from only one closer who just happened to be a superstar closer and
(1:11:09) was just in touch with their Pipeline and so they would close somebody and then they would just shoot him a random text six months later and be like hey uh you want to buy this next thing and that was how they were getting their ascensions and so here was the brilliant idea that we had now I've talked about this uh before but some people forget and some people need to be reminded which is that whenever you make a sale so let's assume this is the point of sale this is when you make your first transaction at this point there are four
(1:11:32) or five opportunities that you can have to basically make ascensions occur so one is immediate so that's like 24 hours you just immediately upsell them that does work the next is um at some sort of time to Value so some immediate quick Value Point the next is the halfway point so just arbitrarily if you have some sort of defin in thing for whatever reason halfway feels like a great time for people to do it and so you can to send them the halfway point the next is if you have some big milestone that they achieve so if you have some more aspirational so think this is like uh
(1:12:03) you get a first first win and this is a big win so this is a first win this is a big W all right so these are kind of like two different they're somewhat similar but uh different in same in spirit different in practicality and then finally here you have your last chance which is usually not when you want to do this and believe it or not most people try and get all of their ascensions here which is why they don't make them and so I kind of think about um ascensions and renewals like this open loop okay and so if we have this Loop that's see if I can draw this not
(1:12:36) ugly so if we have this open loop that opens as soon as you you make a purchase or you make a sale I have this weird belief that people basically close this Loop and it's closing as they get to the end of something and so we want to sell them when it's most open and so we basically want to keep the party going rather than they're finish and then they're like okay now I'm making another purchasing decision you want them to be in the middle of it and be like no we're just going to kick it out we're just
(1:13:01) keep it keep it going and this is why I think we've been just exceptionally good at um ascensions across all the companies I've had as and I learned this from weight loss when I had sixe challenges I upsold people at 24 hours and I upsold people at the halfway and I upsold people at the at the end so I had three upsell points in six weeks and so if you think you're you're making like again you're not hard closing you're just making offers and you incentivize the person to take the next step as long as is align with their goal they'll take it so the number one thing that we did was that we aligned to the journey so we
(1:13:31) actually created customer journey and said at these points these trigger closing calls so if you say that then it's like okay well how do you make sure that that actually happens so I told you earlier that we typically don't do like uh commissions unless it's sales-oriented now this is a sales-oriented business and so what we did with this business is we actually split it so the csms got money for sets so they would identify a customer who had reached one of these points because they were the ones who were in touch with the customers that makes sense right and so they say hey I think you
(1:14:00) should talk to Shawn Shawn can definitely get you set up right and so if they did a good pass off they got money just for the intro then obviously the closers would get commissions on the sales right and so the result of both of those things is that we went from 0 to one per month happening randomly to 5 to six per month so we five to 6X the backend ascensions by simply saying here's the journey these are the Milestones when these Milestones occur pass them to these guys that's it not complicated but guess how you never find out that this can happen you have no data because you have no start dates you
(1:14:37) don't know where people are at you have know one who's tracked you have no goals that are being reset and so this is why data gives you the opportunities data opens the doors for these other things to occur afterwards and so for the revenue of this business so is a higher ticket B2B business uh this added an extra $2 million in Revenue to the business which drops almost just disproportionately to bottom line so added $2 million in IA just from doing these things and so I don't know about you but I think we Kaz got our
(1:15:04) ascensions so we conquered the the six things that get people screwed now this this business didn't have all six but it had a few of them and let's see what actually happened in terms of the after effect on the business so the profit of this business went from 5% to 30% so he 6X woohoo the second thing we did is we went from having no dat to having data which I don't even have as a line here but we had it the next thing is we went from revenue attention being at 2% to 30% also ironically 30 is our magic number for this business and then for
(1:15:37) this business uh for ascensions we went from 0 to1 to 5 to six per month so we had a 6X here 6X here and by the way there's a reason that those are related let me walk you through some of the big takeaways so that you can apply this to your business so number one they had the wrong who on the back end right so had a cancerous leader who was there only for status and didn't care about the customers at all and just did it did the job because they wanted a paycheck and wanted to make their life as easy as possible and only complained and had a victim mindset so number one if you have
(1:16:06) those people in your business just get them out as fast as possible like the best day to get rid of cancer is today number two the profit is disproportionately made on the back end and I think that the reason the businesses that I've had you know over the years and continue to have are typically disproportionately profitable compared to other businesses in the industry is that we focus so hard on the back I typically build businesses back to front I try and solve how do we make this thing so unbelievably profitable so that I can then outspend
(1:16:32) everybody else on the acquisition and that's fundamentally how I approach most businesses at least once they get to scale and so this business you saw the difference that that occurred by fixing the back end with renewals and ascensions was a 6X increase in profit now mind you they had had some tough times which is why we got involved with this particular business because we thought that there was a big area of opportunity and we obviously proved that out pretty quickly I don't think this took more than 90 days it was not a not a big change um but the stats I think I reported year
(1:16:57) to year but these were uh these were relatively fast changes that you can make in a business the next thing is that if you have no data you will never improve anything I think I beat this dead horse but if you don't know what to do or you don't know how to grow your business it's because you don't know because you don't have data and so the first and most obvious thing that you have to get in place is tracking the next one is that the founder typically has to jump in you have to be comfortable getting your hands dirty you have to be comfortable rolling your sleeves up and so that's both the new
(1:17:25) hire who comes in who's the leader and also the founder and so I think the founder got a little bit too far away from the business and I have this saying that I like which is you want to know where the bodies are buried and so if you have anybody who rolls into you inside of a business department and you say hey how are things going and the person's like ah things are good blah blah blah if you as the founder or even you if you're in an organization you're just a director or leader if you don't know where the problems are in every
(1:17:49) person's Department who's reporting to you or even any every individual who's reporting to you you're too far away because there's always bodies there's always problems and if you don't know what they are you're being an effective leader and so that's how I that's how I keep the the right amount of distance for the things that I'm directly involved in because we spent basically this whole you know quarter or two stabilizing the business driving up the profit margin making sure that we streamline this back end now we can
(1:18:15) actually start scaling it and so I'll just say this as somebody who owns a portfolio of companies we spend as long as it takes to get this right sometimes it's 18 months sometimes it's sometimes it's six months s it's two years and it just takes what it takes but once you like this is where a lot of Founders want to scale like it's getting over your skis right they overextend if this particular founder had spent you know 10 times the money on Advertising it would have been a calamitous event it would
(1:18:39) have been horrible for the business because all it would have done was compounded a negative reputation because they didn't have any processes in place to get people great results and have a wonderful experience and so if if anything it's like you only Market to let people know about your stuff but if your stuff sucks you only want to let as few people as possible no just to keep the lights on right and so like I had zero issue with you know our us ramping down or just keeping stable on ad spend um to keep this business just afloat uh
(1:19:07) because you notice like the the the the profit margin was really small in the business but I was like that's fine I don't care about breaking even right now let's fix all this other stuff improve the bucket fix all the holes then and now we can pour as much as we want on the front end and so now we know with this business we have fixed costs that as we add even more customers that margin will actually continue to expand and so fundamentally this is how we unfuck businesses and uh I hope the six that we uh that we outlined earlier you can identify uh maybe one or two of them that you're struggling with and if you
(1:19:37) are in that boat you at least you know how to fix them and so I just talked about how we fixed the back end of this business but we also fixed the front end of this business and I went through a full breakdown of this was a business that sold via webinar uh to a sales team and so we optimized every part of that process on the front end which drove huge results for the business and so if you check that video out click

(00:00) what's going on everyone uh i want to uh share a one-on-one conversation they had with a buddy of mine from high school uh who just started his own business uh and so he was texting me and uh he was he was saying hey you know i've got this i've got this offer and my value ladder and i want to get your feedback on it uh and before i looked at i said you haven't made a sale right and he was like yeah he said i'm worried about being stuck uh with providing fulfillment because i'm just doing too much and i'm offering too
(00:26) much and i was like right so you haven't made a sale yet and he was like yeah i was like okay uh you need to get over that and i said what's the price and he said 4 800 for 10 weeks and i said listen man just give so much that you feel like the person would feel stupid saying no all right don't try and fix your non-existent overwhelmed fulfillment issue when you haven't even made a sale yet all right close a deal then another and then another and then once you are overwhelmed you then have the then you can start dealing with it and
(00:56) the benefit is that once you've made sales you will have the money from the sales do you have resources to deal with the problem and so this is something that i see all the time right people will they'll try and solve issues that don't even exist i have somebody like this example right he's like i don't want to be overwhelmed with all this fulfillment i'm like dude you don't you haven't even made a sale yet right sell the world right sell everything you possibly can to get them to say yes and then what happens is you're going to
(01:22) start making money and then at that point you can start peeling back the the things that take the most time that are not as valuable but in the beginning you just have to create flow so one of the rules that i always have is create flow monetize flow then add friction all right in that order so once you have demand it means you're making a good offer of some kind then you are getting people to say yes which means you make an offer that's so crazy that someone would be stupid to say no and if that means selling your time
(01:49) selling one-on-one stuff doing flying out to their house or driving over every day whatever it is even if it's unreasonable stop thinking about scale before you've even had the ability to have a single sale right it drives me nuts because i'm like dude you're trying to solve a problem that doesn't even exist it's like it's like when i would have guys who come into the gym and they'd be like hey well you know i want to get bigger but i don't get as big as you and i was like you're not going to sneeze and [ __ ]
(02:10) get jacked all right i was like there's a million steps between where you're at and where i'm at and believe me it won't happen on accident right and so they're like well i don't want to get to like they're trying to solve problems they don't even exist i was like why don't you why don't we start with making you look like you even work out why don't we start there fair enough right and the thing is is like why don't we start with you actually just getting a sale before we even talk about what your fulfillment optimizing for
(02:33) profit even looks like right and so anyways he sent me the big graph of like what he's looking at and i was like it's fine dude just sell the world and deliver right none of it's going to even matter because they're not going to remember any of it they'll just remember how they feel and how well you understood their problems right and if the solution felt unique easy to understand and easy to believe that it would work for them right um and so he he was like yeah it makes sense it's crazy how much of this has been like just removing my own
(03:03) self-limiting belief and i was like yeah money's made in your mind first right poor people have poor beliefs you can't if you're walking towards a door right before you go and turn the knob you envision yourself turning the knob everything happens in your mind before it happens in reality and if you can't envision yourself actually making money doing it then there's no way it's going to happen poor people expect poor outcomes right rich people expect rich outcomes and they don't they don't accept outcomes beyond that they don't make
(03:30) decisions unless they feel like that outcome is possible right and so what happens is those poor beliefs keep people poor all right and so anyways i was like listen man stop obsessing over whether what you're gonna include or what the little offer stack is i say just give away the farm all right make some sales and then when you have money and a business then you can worry about optimizing but for now you're solving around a made-up problem that doesn't even exist you have no fulfillment issues because you have no clients all right
(03:55) sell first over deliver and then optimize for profit all right and so this was just a process that i just see is a mistake that i see happen so many times and if you were starting out sell everything sell the most insane offer you can possibly think of get someone to say yes first all right and then get another person to say yes and if you're like man i'm so overwhelmed that's okay you're supposed to be overwhelmed it's normal especially if you're starting out all right but you're gonna start learning how even to sell right and you're gonna
(04:26) start learning okay well this is something that i'm offering that might have been really valuable in the sale but is actually really easy to fulfill on and something else that i promised out to fill on they actually didn't care that much about it but now it's taking all my time and over time you can start peeling those people pieces back and making it into an offer that's both profitable and attractive to the prospect but when you're starting out you don't know and so the best thing in my opinion is to just stack as much valuable as possible to
(04:50) get them to say yes all right and so what that means is you don't have to be exceptional at sales in the beginning because what you do is you give something you give an offer so good that someone feels stupid saying no and so what i'll do is i'll wrap up with uh i'll wrap up with the story of how i learned this and so when i was uh 23 i went to a conference and i paid three thousand dollars for a weekend conference and it was three thousand dollars of money i didn't have and it was it was run by a guy named travis jones he went by tj and he was a
(05:19) business coach and i remember when i was there he'd offhandedly mentioned he made a million dollars a year and i was like i was like man i just want to be this guy right i was like i'll do anything to be this guy and everyone there was a business owner except for me and i was way over my head they were talking about like ctrs and conversion rates and you know cost per leads and i was like i don't know what's going on and so anyways during one of the breaks he came up to me he saw that i was like way over my head
(05:42) and he was like hey man do you want to know the secret to sales and i at this point i was learning what the term sales meant i didn't even know what it meant really honestly um and i was like yeah yeah like tell me the secret to sales and so i like pulled my notebook out and i was like i just like didn't want to like miss anything and he said make people an offer so good they would feel stupid saying no and for me it was this huge moment and i underlined it i wrote it down i circled it and it was at that point that i realized
(06:07) that i could still make money even if i wasn't good at sales i just had to make an offer that was good enough that they would feel stupid saying no and so that means if someone said no i could keep adding things until eventually they said yes and that was one of the biggest epiphanies that i had in my life was realizing that if i could just keep going and keep adding value eventually they would say yes and so instead of cutting prices i would keep my price and just add more than anyone else could even imagine so much so that it would be
(06:34) ridiculous and i was willing to scale the unscalable in the beginning because i just needed people to say yes and start the flow right get the flow monetize the flow then add friction and so it was one of the most important lessons of my life it's one that stuck with me through my entire career and in remembering this is i'm now getting you know i'm helping my friend from high school i've got my my neighbor who's starting their entrepreneurial journey it's really reminding me of some of these lessons earlier on and
(06:59) i just uh hope i hope you don't mind me just sharing them with you as we go so anyways keep being awesome lots of love i'll catch you guys soon bye

(00:00) in this video I get really in depth on the actual scaling of a sales team process the training process the onboarding process the management process Etc so that you can scale sales within your organizations the interview process what we're testing for is the speed of response you can test work ethic by how quickly they get back to you because you are a lead to them number two somebody who's intelligent so if somebody sounds like an idiot then it's the impression that they're going to be giving of your brand the next one
(00:21) is you want somebody who can listen so someone's dominating the conversation they're talking they're you know motor mouthing it's not a good idea you want somebody who's kind of an ambivert somebody you can listen and can talk when it's time and socially aware you want someone who's coachable and so you can measure coachability by saying Hey I want you to role play with me in this situation and you just give them a little bit of context I don't care about how well you sell me I just want to hear you talk through things and then what
(00:40) you'll do is you'll give them feedback and then ask them to try again now if someone can take the feedback without an ego then you have somebody who's coachable and if they make Improvement on the second try then you know that they can improve if someone is not coachable and they do not take feedback well you can already know way ahead of time that they're going to be terrible fit for the team now at this point they have to transition their general knowledge of sales to your specific product or service now I think one of
(00:59) the things that's overemphasized is proud technology which underemphasized is Prospect knowledge what we should be focusing on is who are we selling to more than what are we selling because who matters more in the sale the person the product the person right so we want to understand their problems so in depth because if you can explain to somebody exactly the problem that they're going through they will buy whatever you have because they will believe that you so intrinsically understand what they're going through once we've decided to hire
(01:20) this person I like to have a 14 day onboarding period what is covered in the onboarding period is that we want them to listen to sales calls that are good now if you don't have any sales calls that are good like I would recommend you go and sell and do it well and then record those calls and have them listen to it you want them to be bathing in good sales all they're doing all day long is listening to sales calls listening to sales calls listening sales calls and you can see if they watched it based on most software once they've
(01:40) watched let's say about 40 different sales calls they're gonna have a pretty good idea now in between those watchings you want them to work on the script the script should be in my opinion a question based framework it's a framework of questions that lead someone naturally to the conclusion when I review the salesforcement portfolio companies when they're trying to improve there wasn't a core decision that was articulated the sales people in general would multiple times throughout the sales say do you have any questions for
(02:02) me do you have any questions for me and that's an indication that the salesperson doesn't know how to close clearly not following the script because you're not asking the prospect to come with more reasons to not buy right you're asking them to make a decision it's going to be very clear at the beginning of the call which is clarifying why we're here and then labeling them with the problem so that's the closer primary clarify why they're there label them with a problem overview their past experiences and pains once
(02:21) you have that you've gathered enough info you say cool I think you'd be a good fit can I tell you about it you get invited to sell which is the S and then you explain in very short analogies why you think you're going to be able to solve two to three of the problems that they explained and then you ask for the sale and then enr are explaining what their concerns and then reinforce the decisions and so once we have a script do you want to boil down the decision to the most basic unit possible and the reason you have to do that thinking is
(02:43) because you don't want them to try and think about what the decision is you want to give them the decision that they have to make by the end of the call and so if you're selling a B2B service it would be like the decision we have to make is whether you're going to make more money on your own than you will with us in excess of our thing what most people do is they just talk for 30 minutes and then they just present the price and they just don't have any structure of the conversation and they don't actually do any fact finding they
(03:01) go on off all of these all these changes why are you here what is your problem what have you tried to solve here's how I think we can help you given what you just said to make this one decision which is can we help you more than you could on your own yes or no fantastic close that's it once we've clarified what that scripting needs to look like and that's big picture there's obviously wording but for the sake of this video I want to talk bigger picture so once you have that and this person is watched themselves in sales they're studying the
(03:23) script what you want to do is you want to role play with them you want to role play with them every morning during that process so they get better at it once they pass the role play test right and if you're like whoa that sounds like a lot of work well it is a lot of work to build a great sales team once they sell you on them being able to have this sales conversation then you put them on the floor on a half schedule you're not going to give them a full schedule because you want them to blow through a ton of leads you give them a half
(03:42) schedule the second half their day they're still reviewing the calls they had and then you're still meeting with them twice a day beginning of the day and a day the second week of this training when you're reviewing the sales costs with them they now have fresh ones that they went through that you're going to give them feedback on here's how you have these meetings when you do sales manager meetings you're communicating the goals which in sales is usually pretty sure straightforward you're making sure they're motivated and you're
(04:02) training them that is the point of the job you motivate and you train as long as they're clear on what their kpis are 30 minutes before the call that you have with the new trainee you listen to one or two of their sales calls at 2x you know speed take written notes of all the things that you would want to improve when you get on the call with them which should happen immediately afterwards because it's going to be fresh in your mind you then look at your notes and then you want to bold or prioritize one to two highest impact things that they
(04:25) can do now there's probably a hundred things they're doing wrong but you just want to start with the highest impact things and then you give them those things and it takes about five minutes to communicate that 30 minutes to review and write the notes five minutes to communicate the thing that the one to two highest leverage things that they can do to improve and then 25 minutes where you role play again with them with the new changes and then they go back the next day they do more calls you listen to see if they did the thing they
(04:46) didn't do the thing roll play again the next day you listen to recordings now maybe they got it right you say hey keep doing that you're getting better now let's also do this thing when someone says I got to think about it when someone says I have to talk to my spouse or when someone says that's a lot of money let's drill this overcome this is what I need you to say you have to Flex that muscle as many times you can get those reps in within that 25 minute period And so as you're scaling a sales team you need to do that with all of the
(05:07) Reps that is what Sales Management is it's not just like sitting there having one weekly meeting and checking in on people and asking them what their pipelines at you need to be reviewing sales calls with written notes prioritizing where they can improve the most and then communicating and drilling them on those things maintaining the culture of the team through three things one is having a leaderboard that is Visual and up to date at all times sales people are competitive you want to Foster that competition number two is
(05:30) that you want to have clear kpis and some sort of bonus and we like every 30 days to 42 days every four to six weeks having some sort of big little thing that they can brag about winning some sort of sales competition of the different objectives that we have optimized for the one that has worked best for all of our portfolio companies is optimizing for cash up front there's three things one is the leaderboard two is the kpi in competition and the three is that you have to cut the bottom 10 on a quarterly basis if you're not cutting
(05:55) you're communicating with the team that's okay to suck and it will drag down the culture of the team and so the job of the manager besides training is motivation motivation comes from culture and the standards that we set for ourselves and what you agree to tolerate and so fundamentally Sales Management is a skill of Tolerance is the person who tolerates the most is the one who has the weakest team you can tell the difference between the winning teams and losing teams usually by the coach how can you have one coach go from a losing
(06:17) team in the NFL to almost undefeated team in one year because of the leadership because of the culture because of the Mojo because we say we no longer tolerate these things like if you want to be here this is a world-class sales organization and if you are on this team it means that you're agreeing to them there was a time a few years back where our sales team got a little bit bloated got a little bit fat and so I ended up cutting more than half the team and then I had a meeting with everybody afterwards and I wanted to
(06:39) reset the tone and I was like guys if you're here it's because a we value and we think that you're solid but B is because we think that you're going to buy into the vision of what we will have for the future which is we want to build a world-class sales organization and if you want to stay on this team then it means that you're agreeing to that and I don't want to say that you're inherently agreeing to that I want to let you guys sleep on it because tomorrow if you want to quit that's fine you just let me know
(06:57) in the morning no harm to foul I'd rather you just tell me because what we're going going to go through is going to be a significant change and so if you're a sales manager coming into an organization you say these are the new standards of what we will do I expect you to all attend our 5 a.m training for an hour where we drill together I expect you to show up on time to every single call I expect you to clean your pipelines every single day and that you put the call notes in the CRM as required if you do not do those things
(07:20) even if you're the best closer on the team I will fire you are we clear and the reason I do that is because I want the culture of this team to be one of excellence in everything we do because if it's worth doing it's worth doing well and so you have to set that tone on the team to get them to want to raise up and that's where the leadership of sales manager is so important as a side note I have rarely found that the best salesperson is the best sales manager sales managers tend to be more giving in general and more stable as people
(07:44) there's less emotional highs and lows they are more even they need to be the rock of the team that people look up to no one respects a sales manager who says do all these things and doesn't do it themselves and so they have to emulate or exemplify what work ethic looks like what following through looks like which finishing your checklist every day looks like being first to show up for the meeting in the morning before everyone else does like you have to lead by example the last piece I want to hit on here is the Cadence which is what
(08:09) frequency are we talking to our sales people the first 14 days you're going to be talking to that person once or twice a day when they're getting onboarded once they get out of that training wheels period which is the half week if they meet the quota which is the minimum allowable close rate or whatever metric you want to use then they can get a full schedule once on the full schedule they're still kept on that and everyone understands that if you drop below kpi for two weeks you go on a pip which is a performance Improvement plan which means
(08:29) you go basically regress back to being a trainee which means I now have to train you the way we were and I'm going to take even more attention to fixing your calls and getting you back on track if after the next two weeks you still haven't improved you're all that's the name now when you hire people you also set that expectation this is how this works this is a dangerous place to work we do that because we expect Excellence you want them to be fired up they'll be like let's [ __ ] go the Cadence after you've graduated someone from trainee to
(08:52) full time is you would meet with them on a weekly basis and then maybe after a year every other week if they're just killing it but most times most sales people meet on every basis just to clean the engine check in on things give them a couple of tidbits hear them out Etc the structure of those calls already outlined in terms of how you give feedback that same feedback structure applies to all of the existing guys too which is an hour per guy per week is for the sales management and so you take 60 to here maybe two calls because you can
(09:17) listen to it on faster rate and then you can have your written feedback and after you have the call with them you want to message them or email them the Salient blocks and if you're an organized person which I recommend you be if you're a manager I like having a tab of all my sales guys and having the things that I want them to work on each week so that I can just date it and say like last Monday I said these two things come back this Monday and so when I'm reviewing it the next week I'm saying this is the two
(09:37) things I tell them to work on did they improve it yes no cool when I come back to that call I'm like hey we said these two things did you do it did it results in you making more deals awesome cool big meeting Cadence you've got your weeklies you've got your monthlies you've got your one-on-ones that happen on a weekly basis or more frequently if they're on a performance plan or a trainee and then you have as a team daily huddle end of day huddle the end of day is a short just like hey how's everyone doing checking in cool awesome
(09:59) make sure you clean your pipelines Etc the early morning one is a training if you want you can make it optional and if you're on a performance plan or you're a trainee it's mandatory with the right culture teams most guys always attend that's the overarching structure for scaling a sales team in an organization the only other thing that can happen is that they will lose conviction that's when sales can get cold the things that keep people motivated are the competitions because that keeps things fresh because it's a very repetitive job
(10:22) but also reading testimonials of clients they recently sold and the results that they're experiencing and you do that so that they feel like they're good guys because a lot of times sales can feel very hunt and kill but you want to sell from a place of empathy genuine empathy not nice guy but like I really want to help you which means you need to make a decision and that's what like I'm not going to let you hide in your excuses again because I really am trying to help you not say I am because I've seen guys
(10:44) just like you change their lives by doing this and I know you're just putting [ __ ] up and you're afraid and that's okay because we're going to help you you have to have somebody who who's willing to push through the know because they believe in the product and the transformation the other person is going to experience not because they have their ego tied into it and they want to close the sale to be number one you get there backwards and you do that by having people who were clients hop on a sales call and talk about their
(11:07) experience the second best thing is to watch videos of testimonials with the team before you start the day in the early morning huddle and then the third is just just read them out loud yourself and ideally what you want is if you're going to read them out loud have the guy who sold the person read the testimonial because then it'll double down on their conviction

A Magic Business Genie Grants You 3 Wishes... - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) we doubled the profit of a five million dollar business in less than eight weeks and we followed a single specific process that i'll break out in this video and at the very end of the video i'll walk you through a hypothetical example of a cavs business that would be the best business ever that taught people how to grow their cabs so you can apply it to your business using the same process so i want you to imagine that you have a business or you'd like to start a business that has a hundred customers that pay a hundred dollars a
(00:22) month i'm trying to use the simplest math possible so 100 customers 100 a month so that means it's doing 10 000 a month in revenue now let's assume that in order to fulfill those customers we have eight thousand dollars a month in cost so making two thousand dollars a month in profit ten thousand dollar top line two thousand dollars bottom line eight thousand dollars of cost that's the business now you rub a magic ipad a genie appears and this is not any kind of genie this is a business genie and this niche genie has one wish that he
(00:51) can grant you and so he says i can grant you one wish he says i will double your business in one of three ways you need to tell me which way you want me to do door number one or wish grants of number one is i will double the amount of customers that you bring in every month with this business let's assume that your churn is not that good so people stay for on average three months number two i will double your price so you'll have the same number of customers and i'll double how much they pay you every single month nothing else will change
(01:17) door number three he says now what i'll do is i'll double how long they stay so instead of staying for three months they'll stay for six months which of the wishes do you take the genie up on really be honest in the comments tell me what your first guess was going to be a b or c so with door a he doubles it so now we have 200 customers a month what happens well if we have 200 customers paying us a month we now are making twenty thousand dollars in top line revenue and assuming everything's scaled proportionately we would have four
(01:45) thousand dollars a month in profit and sixteen thousand dollars a month in cost double the number of customers we double the amount of profit doubled our business awesome let's go to door three because people are staying twice as long but you're getting the same amount of customers per month eventually you will get to the same equilibrium point as the first one the exception is that that wish accomplished does something more powerful which is it increases your ltv now because of that and the additional months that they pay you most businesses
(02:12) it's more profitable the last one someone pays than the first one usually a cost of acquisition cost of onboarding there's more costs associated with getting a new customer than keeping someone if you can double the lifetime growth profit per customer then your cost of acquisition can be bigger than it could in the first example here i eventually get to the same top line but i have more bottom line because i didn't have to spend as much on marketing so between a and c you pick c now you're like alright well what about door b so
(02:36) let's say we had the same hundred customers but now instead of paying 100 a month they're paying 200 a month we still have the same cost of fulfilling them it's 8 000 and our profit went from 2 000 a month to now we have literally the extra 100 a month that's pure profit so we six x the profit of the business with one change for those in the audience who are thinking but not as many people would buy so i told you that we increased how much profit the business made i'll tell you the one change that we did was we've looked at
(03:02) the entire marketplace that were selling a similar service to theirs and it was based on our research we felt that the market could support a 50 higher price and so we literally and this is already a pretty expensive thing we literally did nothing but add 50 to the price and changed nothing about the product and guess what happened more people bought why because when something becomes more expensive people perceive its value in a higher way and because of the brand that the person had it was more aligned with
(03:27) the person to have a higher price tag now most times in most markets you have supply and demand and when the price goes up demand goes down in most markets now not all markets and more times than not it doesn't drop by the same proportion so if you double the price sometimes you sell a third fewer but if you double the price and you've 6x the profit potential on a customer if i 6x my profit on a potential customer and i do it at uh two-thirds the price then i tripled the profit of the business still you still make way more money and so
(03:55) finding the absolute perfect point of profit many times comes from raising the price and pricing is one of those very interesting things because it's very tied to emotions a lot of people are very afraid of raising the price because they don't want to break it i want to talk to you about how to raise the price if that is your goal which is why the number one lever that you have on profits is pricing and constantly testing a lot of people's tests split test their pages they split test their scripts they split test their offers but
(04:18) the thing that they forget to test is their price and it's the strongest lever of all three levers okay so let's walk through a hypothetical business and the steps that we would need to take in order to increase the price if that's what we decided was the right call so the first thing we would do is we'd survey the existing audience using the van west store pricing survey and let's say this business sold a 12-week grow your cabs program and let's say it was 1200 for 12 weeks very simple and on the first third of the survey we're trying
(04:40) to find out more about the customer so we're like hey you know what was the main reason that you bought this was there an event that was coming up that incentivized you to do it what's your income level what's your job what was the primary way that you found out about us right so it's like okay these are the things that we know about the avatar and so we've got those client demographics okay second part is the four questions of the van west what if it was super expensive what if we're way too cheap what if it were a stretch and then what
(05:01) if it were a bargain right those are the four questions now we say of all the things that we do in our cavs program which is the book the training the nutrition the stretching thing that we have the one-on-one calls for accountability the body system that we've put together so you have an accountability buddy like all of these things that we do in our value stack which of these if we only had one of them you would keep and which of these if we got rid of one you would lose and not care you take that data number one
(05:22) number two now we communicate it internally first all right so we got to communicate to the team we got a community of sales team security marketing team then we communicate it to our customers this is what's happening this is why it's happening past present future this is what we did to get here this is why it's important now this is what we're trying to do later we're investing the business because we want to fulfill our promises finally now we bring it up to the new customers who are coming in so we hit our lists up to let
(05:45) them know we had the urgency in step four and then the last step is now we officially have this new price now what we want to do now is expect the fact that the change in price will probably result in fewer sales by total volume and the reason for that is because we cleared the pipeline before the price change it happens once you have that you have to let it shake out you have to let it settle and it's really trying it's very difficult to do that because it takes guts but once you make that you let it settle then you just do the math
(06:09) and let the math do the talking but if you sell it at twice the price you make more money so in our hypothetical cab scenario let's say we bumped it to 2000 or 3000 because we found out that that was the price that was right at that sweet spot that was the stretch but they'd still do it we might have just two or three x the profit of the business by making that one change and maybe because cavs are the coolest thing ever got even more people to buy it because they thought they really could get the results that we said we were
(06:32) gonna help them experience if this was interesting to you go to acquisition.com third video is on pricing you can watch more about pricing as it applies to your business it's absolutely free you don't need opt-in or anything you can just watch it

My $100M Leads Affiliate Marketing Guide - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) I got 10 000 people to promote my next book 100 million dollar leads absolutely free and to give you a visual of that that's like an entire Stadium full of people promoting your thing and now imagine those people leaving that stadium and then entering their own individual stadiums and shouting being like go check this thing out and the best part is it's absolutely free I was thinking to myself like what would be the craziest way that I could launch this book to make a big Fanfare about it because my first book 100 million dollar
(00:23) offers was all about making a crazy offer to people as in making an offer so good people feel stupid saying no and I tried to make the book A meta example of the concept within the book I talk about having elements to enhance the offer having a big price to Value discrepancy and so I offer the book for 99 cents but included a course which most people would charge thousands of dollars for absolutely free without even asking people to opt in for it all of this was just to demonstrate the value equation which was the core concept of that book
(00:47) now my 100 million dollar leads book is a different book it's about advertising in order to get leads and so I was like okay well if I wanted to demonstrate all the concepts in that book I'd have to do something totally different than how I did with offers and so with this I was like well how do I show that can get lots of leads with a book and so I was like I'm gonna hold a big book event so I'm going to hold a book launch event it's me virtual and it's going to be free and everyone's invited and I'm going to see how many people I can get
(01:11) to this thing and I'm not going to do it the way I could do it which would just be like I could post it on my social media I probably get plenty of people to go I wanted to use every single one of the methods I talk about in the book to promote the book itself and one of those methods is called affiliate marketing and so the way that I actually did this in the real world was that we created an affiliate opt-in which is just put your name your email your phone number and then what we would give them is a unique
(01:33) URL so a custom link that if someone clicked their link it would take them to the leads opt-in page for the event but it would be tracked back to them and then the top 10 Affiliates I said I would hop on a live q a call with their audience if they won and they were in the top 10. anyone who got at least 10 people to show up to the event I would give two bonus chapters for my book that I'm not going to release with the book as an added benefit and if you think about this it's because I want to incentivize the highest Affiliates to
(01:59) promote the most and become competitive but I don't want somebody who has like a hundred percent email list to think oh I'm never going to win that why bother well there's also a prize that everyone can win there's scarcity at the top but then just a tiny hurdle for everyone which is actually one of the strategies I talk about when creating an affiliate compensation system because it actually works the same way whether you're promoting an event or supplements or Widgets or Services it all works the same way so inside this video I'm going
(02:22) to talk about who to pick to affiliate with how to onboard them properly and set expectations how to get them to start advertising and how to keep them advertising along the way and a little bonus of how to structure that off all right so the first thing that you have to figure out when you're creating an affiliate strategy or influencer strategies who's the ideal affiliate one of the more advanced advertising strategies is that you actually have two customers now you have your affiliate Avatar and then you have your customer
(02:46) Avatar so now it means that you have to deliver to two types of people rather than one and that's where it gets more complicated if you're starting out that being said there's different ways of doing this in different Industries for example if I'm a brick and mortar business my affiliate strategy is let's say I'm a massage person I could then go and say okay what are all the big businesses in the area and say okay these guys hire 10 new employees a week it's a big Corporation I say hey Mr Corporation I want to give each of your
(03:08) new employees two free massages on the house here's a coupon you can give it to them in their new employee packet why would that business say no to giving their employees some sort of treat and for me I'm happy to just get new customers and if I make that partnership now with 10 or 100 companies then I'm going to be able to fill up my books and how much did that cost me in advertising literally only the effort to reach out to them and make the ask right and so you have with an affiliate strategy two levels of offers what's the offer you're
(03:32) going to make them and then what's the offer they're going to make on your behalf to their customers right and so the two free massages is my cut is my offer to their customer which in this place is an employee which totally underrated strategy because they'll never see you as competition but then also why am I going to make this offer to the employer the offer to them is your employees will like you more and have a better onboarding experience and be de-stressed by having this thing and you'll be perceived as a more caring
(03:55) employer that's the offer I don't need to like incentivize them and pay them or do anything like that because it's in their best interest to the same degree if I'm still that massage therapist I might go to a chiropractor and say hey some of your people get their backs cracked and they probably need someone to massage anybody who gets their back crack with you I'll give them a massage on the house and then all of a sudden that chiropractor gets 50 new patients a month will send you a certain percentage of those patients now you could also
(04:15) even pay them on top of that to further incentivize them but typically if you do a really good job and you establish a relationship they'll start doing that and if you're really smart about it you'll start referring them business too and then that is where you really start the machine going that's a brick and mortar example an influencer example is probably what most people are used to which is like hey use my discount code for 10 off and then the influencer gets some Kickback now sometimes that's just a straight endorsement you pay them to
(04:39) post which is much more like paid advertising or you do some sort of split based on what they bring you which is much closer to affiliate advertising which is what I'm talking about a third version of this is the main way that I used to Market this book which is affiliate marketing which is much more common in the internet marketing world this covers a huge amount of people who have lists and audiences that they have trust with what you have to do is say Hey you will gain trust with your audience the trade is that sometimes
(05:03) they do lose trust with their audience which is why people pay to get Affiliates ultimately your brand matters a lot with why they would trust their customers and their Goodwill with you and so the reason in my opinion that the book launch which is not here but pretend I have my book right here has gone well using the strategy is that many people in my audience trust that I'm going to over deliver which I absolutely am to Their audience and so Their audience will then associate the value they get from me with them and so
(05:31) it's almost like them getting free Goodwill by promoting my stuff right and that's what you want the crazy part about the affiliate strategy that I'm going to outline for you is that I actually have zero Financial incentive which is not common most the time if you go to a social media you know you get some influencer and you're like hey will you promote my supplement brand they're like well what's my split right because they're like I'm going to be taking some Goodwill out of my audience so I need to be compensated for that but if you have
(05:53) such Goodwill you might do it for free if you actually thought that it was good I mean think about when a friend of yours is like hey what pair of shoes are those you're like oh love these shoes or I love this bag or whatever it is you're being an affiliate just in a micro with your micro influence to that business and you do it because you feel like you will actually gain in relational Capital because that person will go buy the shoes use the shoes love the shoes tell you about it associate with you that's
(06:14) why you do it the affiliate strategy that I learned from my process was simple I have two layers of Affiliates and I think this is useful for anyone when you're thinking about your products or your business is that I've got my super affiliate level and then I've got regular Affiliates the key difference is that I like to have two polar opposite strategies the people who are super Affiliates have big audiences and they tend to be competitive more status driven Etc and so I want to align what they want which is status with what I
(06:37) want which is people what I decided to do was say hey and this is going to be pretty key and I haven't I haven't explained this publicly yet so you know enjoy I said the top 10 will get an AMA live with me to Their audience now here's why this is unique and different one I have a very small supply of time like I don't speak in public very much I think in the last year of companies that I don't own I've done one speech I try and limit my supply of time that I'm available to other people's audiences imagine you're now in the audience of
(07:06) this super affiliate and he says Hey register for this book of it now if I'm the customer or on that person's audience I think what's in it for me why don't I just go to Alex's thing rather than clicking your link or why do I click your link for someone else's well here's why this benefits them so if I'm the affiliate I say hey click my link so that our community can have the prize rather than me saying hey the top 10 Affiliates get supercars right because why does that benefit Their audience because if I did if I did it exactly
(07:32) that hey let me help me win my contest that is withdrawing from Their audience but if I do it this way then I can say hey I actually want to support you in your audience and that way when you make this email to your list it doesn't cost you anything and so that's why I engineered it this way so that this is just Goodwill they gain and the reason why is aligned so that their incentive my incentive and the audiences that are all aligned towards the same outcome which is to get the click and sign up for the event so whenever you're making
(07:55) something for any affiliate you want to align all of the incentives to the greatest degree possible now when you say I'm just going to pay them that aligns your incentive and their incentive but not the audience's incentive and so the more aligned incentives you get the bigger the outcome now the second level is regular affiliate so if you're like okay well right now I think the top people all have like a thousand people that they've sent over to uh the book launch for us and so if you have a thousand total followers the likelihood that you're
(08:19) going to send all thousand is probably pretty low and so you might be like well why even bother so you have to answer that question which is why I have the second tier so why bother even affiliating to begin with why bother even promoting this I said if you get more than 10 to show up to the event just 10 people and if you have an email list or you have any following whatsoever even if you don't have any of those things you just know 10 people who you think it would be valuable you don't have to have any marketing skills to get
(08:41) 10 people to a thing and the reason you would do it remember aligned incentives is that they trust that if I say hey this is going to be worth it I'm going to deliver on that and the reason they might be able or willing to make that bet is because if I've said it in the past that it would be worth it I have delivered on that and so give you a bit of context I've only emailed my list I think like three or four times in the past year and I've made a lot of content we put out 250 a week a thousand pieces of content a month so 12 000 a year
(09:05) right roughly in terms of pieces of content and only four pieces of content that I say I think you guys should go check this out it's worth the time right not to say I don't think the other time is worth it but if I'm going to make the ask I want to make sure that whatever they get is far in excess because let's say every piece of content 80 of people think it's good and 20 of people think it's mid whatever okay but if I know that 99 of people are going to believe that it's going to be amazing then that's one where I have a low risk of
(09:28) saying hey you're going to get more than your time by doing this or by watching this and so from the big picture perspective when you're promoting this you don't want to like smash everyone all at once the whole time because then people get sick of you right the best analogy I've heard from this is something called whisper T shout and I heard this somewhere at some event and I don't know who originally came up with it but I just love this you've got whisper T shout and this is really like the three phases of promoting anything
(09:49) so whisper is where you drip itty bit like not even hints you're just building anticipation and so this is like the Godzilla scene in the movie theaters that's just like the foot and it's just says may 2025 right and so they don't tell you the plot there's no character development it's just enough to get you excited that's all it is within the context of this book over the last two years I've just been sprinkling little stories maybe like up another day of riding another like just oh got another thing I got something
(10:19) good for you like and I'm just showing just not a lot not saying what's inside of it not talking at all about the contents just saying I'm writing a book and there's some and it's going to be good you guys are going to love it right and showing the work because let me give you a quick example on this is that if I said I spent two years making this 10 minute video How likely would it be that you think that video was good compared to I said hey I spent two hours on this 10 minute video you'd probably be way more likely to watch the 10 minute video
(10:45) that I spent two years working on and so the same thing works with whatever projects you want to sell the further out you can show them that you're working on this thing the more they'll believe that you have invested in it and I learned this from an early mentor of mine he said the key to making it a big deal is to make it a big deal and so like it doesn't matter what you're doing if you tell people that something's a big deal then they will believe that it's a big deal and so I can't say it more simply than that and so if I show
(11:08) you that I've been working on this for two years then when I say it's finally ready people be like wow he's worked a long time on this I want to check it out so you build curiosity here we transition to the t-space let me let me walk you through so phase one is six weeks plus out that means like three months out 12 months two years out you're just Whispering that's all we're doing here then we get into teasing so this is where you you peel back a corner of the page and you and you show one page or you do a reading of a paragraph
(11:35) or you make videos about some of the content right that's inside the book now you don't show the whole thing you just zoom in on a little bit just just a clip just a little something something so they're like now I have a prediction of what type of value I'm going to get from this thing right now you're looking at the trailer right that's 30 seconds long that has a couple dinosaurs running in and out you're like oh there's there's action in this like you get a general direction of what this movie is going to
(11:58) be about this is six weeks to seven days then you transition to shout shout is the last seven days leading up into the thing at this point you're not whispering you're not teasing you're not hinting you're like this is the thing it's gonna be awesome be there and most of this is reminders a big part that most people mess up and this is what I see a lot of marketers do overall is they spend six weeks shouting right people literally get bored of your thing before before it even happens because you've talked about it so much right so
(12:24) that's number one and you want it to be a you want it to feel like this it's like intermittent intermittent more frequent and then you Crescendo up into whatever the event is right and you get big lots of money there you go all right when we're in the shout phase how effective you are at the shout is actually predicted by everything you did before that and so what happens is most people don't provide enough value before they say hey I've got my thing right and so what they have to do is they start having to artificially create value and
(12:50) increase their content frequency in order to approximate having provided value beforehand and so they try and provide value and ask and provide value and ask at the same time and it just looks disjointed because they don't have any good will to withdraw from and so then they ask and Shout even harder and louder until eventually no one listens to them you don't want that we want to be really careful about when we're shouting it is super effective but then you burn it out quickly and so you want to use it right here so it leads to the
(13:14) event during the whisper and tease phase this is something that my brain director and I Caleb had a long discussion about which is during these time periods are we going to only talk about the book it's like well no what about during the cheese phase are we only going to talk about the book no we're going to still provide value the exact same way we have been in the exact same volume we have been and then added it on top so think about that you're like wait that sounds like more work sure is my team's behind the cameras this way
(13:40) the idea though is that why would I want to decrease the value that I'm providing my audience during the time when I want to ask them to do something even more it's like no not only do I want to make sure that I'm providing my regular value which is about business content in general growing businesses scaling sales marketing Etc but then I also want to talk about the book and if you want to be clever with it whenever you're making your advertisements because this is an advertisement it just means making other
(14:03) people know about your stuff that's what I'm doing right you want to still make sure that the advertisement itself is still valuable like who here likes going to the movie theater and then watching the trailers I love watching the trailers before a movie like I'm bummed if I don't get the first 15 minutes before the movie why because they are valuable they're entertaining I like watching them and so there's a reason they design them that way people share trailers why because it's valuable and if you share the trailer what did it do
(14:24) you got more people to find out about it which is why well-designed advertisements provide value to the person and let them know about the thing that's the magic throughout this whole process if you think about value as this line This is constant all the way through it it's unchanging all right so we're providing value the whole time and then we sprinkle in whisper whisper then we start showing more details about what they're going to find out the value that they're going to get and then we remind we remind we remind until the event
(14:48) meanwhile still posting value still adding to the audience so that each of these hit because think about this every day you have new people who come into your world and they don't have two years of Goodwill so I have probably more people coming to my world right now because so many more people are promoting my book that I actually have to deliver more value than I ever have because I have so many new people who are now going to find out about my stuff and what a shame it would be if they enter my world and then the only thing
(15:13) they have is a smash for me saying go grab something go check out my virtual event right so I have to be delivering in higher amounts because I have more people than ever who are seeing your stuff right that's the idea and that is the whole concept between the three-phase attack of whisper tease shout and for everyone who wants to use paid influencers paid Affiliates endorsements I have tons of money examples costs and returns how to calculate it how to set what percentages for what tiers of Affiliates how to set
(15:39) up multiple tiers how much value I put in each one have all of those and all the best practices that I've used inside of here I didn't want to include in this video not because I don't want to share it because I think a lot of people get lost in the numbers and you probably want to read and reread it again in front of you which is why it's in the book so if this is interesting you're like man I would love to find a way that other businesses could advertise my stuff on my behalf and do it for free or do it only after I've made money so
(15:59) there's no risk to me then Affiliates are your play so let's talk about the actual mechanics of this all right so for me because I didn't have to do payouts it became significantly easier for me to get Affiliates all right right because typically when you have an affiliate there's two ways to do it you can have paid and unpaid So Paid Affiliates either pay them with money or you scratch their back they scratch your back right this is the collab this is the I'll promote your thing if you promote my thing now for me I don't feel
(16:24) confident that I could promote a lot of my affiliate stuff just being really candid because I don't know if they're necessarily at that level yet or I wouldn't risk the trust that I have built with my audience just being very candid but they're not asking me to do that so that's okay now on the unpaid side they have to get other things and that's where I'm adding those extra bonuses in in order to get them to want to do it when you have a paid affiliate you have to get them to fill out all these forms taxes so that you can pay them and they can be
(16:50) seen as uh I don't even remember what it is maybe it's a K1 or a 1099 I think it's a 1099 they get a 1099 from your company because they all have sent you money and then you have to send them money back and there's all these forms you have to have them fill out now the good thing with this is that if someone goes to the trouble of doing this they'll likely that they want to promote a significantly higher so there are benefits this if I'm in a B2B business all day long I want to have a little bit more friction I want to qualify the
(17:11) affiliate I want to make sure that they're sending the right types of people to whatever it is that I have especially if I'm selling services now I have a book which is delivered without my time and so I'm willing to forego some of the friction that I would normally put it with a B2B business in order to get more scale and volume in a b2c scenario so for here the way the opt-in form worked for our affiliate campaign if you've if you want to check it out you can go to acquisition.
(17:34) com forward slash affiliate and what you'll see is you'll see a first name last name email phone and that's it and you'll see a button when they click that the thank you page and we did it in two ways the thank you page has their now custom link that they can use to promote your thing and they get an email because sometimes people lose it or they don't screenshot or whatever that also has a copy of that this sounds like tiny stuff but sometimes like the extra email or putting on the thank you page makes a 25 difference in the amount of people who
(17:58) promote your stuff and as a side benefit here we actually changed the banner on top of the submit form and increase the amount of Affiliates who decided to sign up on the opt-in Page by 60 all right and so little things can still make huge differences in the Campaign which is why I'm sharing these tiny details with you now when you want the Affiliates to sign up if you want volume you make it easier if you want quality you make it harder and the push-pull in business is figuring out where the sweet spot is for
(18:22) your for your products at your price point I'm going really Mass market for a book which is considered probably a pretty cheap thing all right and so I can go all the way on this side and then I'm trying to make this as easy as simply possible so like how long does it take to sign up to be an affiliate of the book 30 seconds and literally someone can go 30 seconds and then make a story on social media and immediately share it and get leads right so I made it really low time delay remember the value equation we can still apply it to
(18:45) every step in this whole process so the value is they become an affiliate the time delay is 30 seconds the effort and sacrifices they type their stuff in and the perceived likely that it works is they click submit and if it works they're done right so we still apply the same four variables to every step in this process to get the most amount of people to promote your stuff now from your promotional aspects there are two big promotions that you'll be running concurrently again remember I said there's two types of customers well that
(19:08) means that I'm running marketing campaigns to the customers who I want to show up to the event and I'm also now running campaigns to the Affiliates to remind them to promote the vet right because once you get the affiliate that's the easy part the hard part is getting them to advertise your thing and so this is where reminders reach outs like tokens here's Starbucks just getting them engaged messaging them to remind them to keep doing it because the thing is is if they promote it once it'll help a little bit but if they
(19:34) promote it consistently throughout the whole time they're all in and the depth that you will get with their audience because their audience will see that they are bought in you will carry on some of that trust when you make your offer for whatever it is so one of the important things is that I have a big list of people who are going to this event and so I said hey it would mean the world to me if you shared this event with your audience so I sent two emails to that big list and from those two emails we got 9 000 people to say they
(19:58) wanted to register now I share on my story I shared in other places but the majority of that came from my email list who decided to become Affiliates and promote it to their audiences here's a mistake that a lot of people make is that they will then keep messaging the the audience that's supposed to show up to the event to promote the event and then they lose Goodwill in that audience and so I opt to do two Max three advertisements over the entire length of whatever your campaign is to let them know that the opportunity exists and
(20:24) even within those messages I assume that my customers are going to be the vast majority of people are going to read this so be smart about what you're saying don't be like oh man we're gonna sell a shitload of books here right like you can't say that right like because your customers are like that's how he sees me right you don't want that and so the idea is like this is going to be an amazing event like you want to continue to edify the event and follow the same messaging buckets that you would about the main thing but then tie in the why
(20:49) it ties to the mission for them to also support you and the whole cause overall and so for us we sent two emails that created nine thousand and then once they get onto that list then they've given you permission to give them way more information but even then I tend to just because probably my communication style in general I tend to communicate thoroughly but not as frequently like some people want to email every day that's not my vibe and so every week and we set set the expectation up front you will get two emails a week from me from
(21:14) now until the day of the Fig and that way they can think okay there's five weeks I'm gonna get ten emails from it done and then what do I do when I make my promises I keep my promises and so I say the first email is going to be more content that you can then use because I'm going to give them stuff in real time now what did we do with the content I told you I gave them the black book was there any more stuff of course there was but I didn't give it up front because I knew that everybody's going to take that stuff because now that's their
(21:34) Insider Intel that shows that they have more inside knowledge than anyone else does which is why people click their link and also gives them stronger brand Association but then three weeks in I'm going to give them another big packet of stuff that they can then use so that I can guarantee that their ads don't get stale as they promote my thing just like I would for myself so I would not give them that same Advantage because I want them to promote it and I want it to work two emails a week one with the content
(21:56) and the other with the update of where they stand because a lot of people are like well where am I how many do I have and this is the part that a lot of people don't get it's like you have to give them tracking back now the more advanced you are as an affiliate marketer and people who manage networks Affiliates sometimes you need to have back-end tie-in so they can get pixel 5 fires and all sorts of stuff now for me because of the nature of this event I didn't mess with any of that because I wanted to make it very easy very light
(22:16) lift for all the Affiliates and I wanted to be more on Goodwill and if they're aligned with the cause more than because they're trying to get a paycheck the right Affiliates are also stoked about the thing right and this is a piece that I think a lot of people miss when they do this is they're like if you just try to get people for the money then it means you've hired mercenaries if you get people for the cause you've hired missionaries right and you want missionaries not mercenaries because mercenaries will just go to the next
(22:35) person who has the highest bidder and then you basically have a reverse race to the bottom you have a race to the top in terms of how much you're willing to pay them to promote your thing which is not a type of business that I want to be in and so I'd rather say hey you're not going to get anything but you're going to get all this Goodwill and if you're associated with that or you want to associate with that then here's a way to do it that's fast and easy and so we provide them even more value than the people who are on the list in their
(22:57) sphere like it's not as more value it's different value that they would find interesting like me explaining how I'm doing this affiliate thing is valuable for them so that they can use it on their own stuff because these are all marketers and promoters in their own right have their own businesses and so for them half the value is seeing what I'm doing behind the scenes so that they can employ it themselves I'll bet you a third of the list of the nine thousand are just want to see what I'm doing and aren't even planning to promote it at
(23:18) all and that's okay I'm fine with that right but by the way if you are going to promote go promote the tldr here is provide value to them just like you would a customer give them stats of where they're at be consistent with whatever promises you make be upfront about the expectations that you have of them and what expectations they can have of you and then stick to those and then the last week the last few days a couple extra reminders and then you're on and then after that you announce the winners and you give them the prizes that you
(23:41) promised and when you choreograph all that together you might be like man that's a lot of work well yeah but so is so valuable is having 9 000 other people promoting your stuff for you because if you think about at the end of the day there's two people who can promote what you have you and other people and there are more of them than there are of you there's a lot of people in the world and there's a lot of people who don't know who you are and so if you can find a way to make it a win-win win you unlock as
(24:03) much traffic as you want for whatever it is you're trying to sell and so the win-win-win because I'm going to say this against I think it's important is that you have to win the affiliate has to win and most importantly Their audience has to win and if you can if you can show them that Their audience wins by them associating with you you will unlock the doors to as much promotion as you want and the coolest part I'm saying this again is that this is absolutely free anyone can do this and all you do is you lead with value
(24:25) and you have to remember that you now have two customers you have your Affiliates that you have to make offers to and deliver on and Market to and provide value to and you have the customers yours and their customers that you know have to deliver on and I will tell you this the standards that the Affiliates will have for how you treat their customers will be even higher than how you treat your customers and the main thing is is because everybody thinks they treat their customers better than they really do and so they expect
(24:46) anyone else to treat them with the utmost respect in care having Affiliates forces you to raise your own standards for how you how good you are at messaging and advertising in general which is one of the things I kind of like about it because it gives me a little bit more pressure to keep over delivering and I will tell you that there are a couple things that I made a couple tweaks that I made to how we're promoting the book that I only made after some of my closest friends were like dude I'm gonna be pushing this to
(25:08) my whole audience and I was like I need to say this different I need to word this differently and these tiny tweaks that I think will give huge up huge outcomes for us and them but I wouldn't have done if I didn't have that next level of pressure and so that is the complete behind the scenes affiliate guide of how I promoted this book 100 million dollar leads and maybe by the time you see this we'll be at 10 000.
(25:28) and real quick if you have an audience that's big or small and you've enjoyed the content or you enjoyed the last book and you think that your audience or your friends would enjoy the next book then you can go register and actually promote it at acquisition.com forward slash affiliate and there's no Financial incentive and you can tell your audience that you have no Financial incentive for doing it and the idea is that if they click your link you might enter to win but I forgot to say the last little secret which is that if you just get
(25:51) over 10 people to the event I'll give you two bonus chapters that I'm not going to release in the book just for every single person who brings 10 people to the event because it means so much to me that I didn't put the value in the book just to give it to you guys because I knew that I wanted this to be special and I wanted to demonstrate what I say in the book in real life and now that you understand the affiliate strategy that I'm using to promote 100 million here is the next video for making you more dollars

(00:00) 500,000 people. That's the amount of people who registered for my last book launch for $100 million leads. But that's not even the crazy part. The crazy part is that almost a third of those people didn't even know who I was. They were actually referred to the launch by other people for free. Most businesses don't know how to use this advertising method.
(00:19) And so, I'm going to show you not just the theory, but the tactics of how I'm setting up the affiliate structure for my $100 million money models launch so that you can take every single tactic cuz you're going to understand how in-depth it really is. is if you want to use this as your advertising strategy for your business or whatever it is you sell.
(00:34) So, first things first, what the hell is an affiliate? So, we're opening up our fun leads book. And an affiliate is a lead getter. Somebody who gets you leads. All right? They're an independent business that tells their audience to buy your stuff. Affiliates seem like referrals on the outside, but are much different under the hood.
(00:47) First, they own their own businesses and do their own advertising. Second, they agree to offer your stuff to their engaged leads in exchange for money, free stuff, or both. So, just like any business should always start with the offer, which is what are you going to sell? What are you going to give away? Affiliates is the same thing.
(01:00) They're a new customer that you have to think about. What's the offer I'm going to make the affiliate? Again, it's money, free stuff, or both. Now, you can use whatever one you want. You can do combinations for my $100 million leads and $100 million money models launch. I'm using free stuff.
(01:14) Number one reason for that is because paperwork-wise, it's an absolute pain in the ass to pay a gazillion people with 1099s and it's a nightmare. But beyond that, I can also still provide value that probably be better than maybe just some sort of kickback. back. And that's the thing is that sometimes the non-monetary value can be significantly higher than just trying to pay someone 10% back or something like that.
(01:32) And especially if you have something like a book, which is not super expensive, these other things can make it worth it for an audience. But let's get into the offer. So, whenever I set up an affiliate structure, I want to have a two-tiered structure. So, what that means is I want to have something for all the killers at the top who are going to send me a bunch of people with big audiences and whatnot.
(01:50) And I want to have something so that the everyman can still get something because I still want the longtail. I still want all the people who can bring three friends, five friends, 10 friends. And I also want the people who want to bring 10,000. So you don't want to have something that's only for one or the other. You want both. I think about it like this.
(02:02) If we draw this, what are the big players getting? So for us, we're doing top 10 people get a fireside in-person one- on-one Q&A session. Now, there's some thinking behind this. Why do we do this? We do this because the prizes you want to give an affiliate has to not only benefit the affiliate, it also has to benefit their audience.
(02:22) This is something that like so many people don't get. You can get significantly higher engagement from affiliates if they don't feel like they're hard closing their audience on your thing cuz at the end of the day they're like I got to save my my goodwill, my whatever for my own stuff. And that makes sense. Of course they do. So it's like how can we make the thing that we're going to give them something that's a give to their audience so it doesn't detract from the goodwill they have and ideally it adds to the goodwill so that you ultimately benefit them and
(02:46) their audience. So, you want a win-winwin win for you and for the affiliate and their people. With the fireside chat, the key is their audience is going to want to click through their link so that they can submit their questions so that the person who represents them can then ask those questions on their behalf.
(03:00) So, this becomes very valuable. Like, oh, we're in the ATM niche. It's like, okay, well then how do we apply some of this Alex big business stuff to an ATM niche? Well, they wouldn't probably get that answer answered otherwise unless it's like that guy's in front of me and that's what we're talking about for 30 minutes in person.
(03:14) Now, the next tier is like, okay, well, some people are going to be like, well, top 10, that might be tough, but I think I can hit the top 50. Okay, well, the top 50 can be there in person, so they're approximations of this thing. They're still in person. And then I'm basically taking 3 hours. This is in person, all of this, at my headquarters where I'm going to do Q&A.
(03:29) I'll be able to answer maybe a question from them, but they're going to be there. They're going to meet one another. Still super valuable, great experience. Okay, that's the top 50. On top of this, there's also a dinner that I'm taking all the uh all the top 10 guys out to, so it's even cooler. Now what about the bottom guys? So 10 plus.
(03:44) So first we have to decide what is the thing that is the kind of bottom. What's the minimum activation point for someone to become an affiliate or referral that gets something. All right. This depends on how difficult it is to do. So if I said like you have to bring someone in person to my facility like a gym or something then it might be two people because that's a lot of work.
(03:59) Now if it's just like can you make me a text introduction? It's like that might be you know a four or five. Now if it's just can you get someone to opt into something I have to make that higher because the friction is so low. I made it 10 plus. That's what I did last year. It worked great. So, I'm doing it again. If somebody can get 10 plus opt-ins into my thing, for us it's the book launch, then they're going to get multiple things.
(04:20) So, number one is they're going to get an audio book. That's not the book for the launch. It's actually a separate book I recorded specifically for my affiliates. 70 plus one minute tactics that drive profit in businesses. So, it's like it's just super bite-sized, very tactical, really cool. And I made something really sexy because I want that long tail.
(04:38) people who just just want to invite their 10 their 10 friends or their Slack group or their WhatsApp group or their school community, whatever it is. They're like, I don't think I'm going to get top 50, but if you think you're going to invite 20 or 30 people, then get credit for it. You know, get some free stuff, but on top of that, what else can I do? Well, there's also these 50 other seats on this day over here.
(04:55) Well, I could just say top 100, but wouldn't it be more valuable to say, hey, I'll raffle these off to 50 of the people who get this. So, that's what we're doing. So, this is the offer. This is the thing that we give away. The stuff that we want to do is number one, you want it to be big and sexy.
(05:09) Number two, I like things that are unscalable, especially at the top. Of course, I can't do a fireside chat with a thousand people. It wouldn't work for them, wouldn't work for me, wouldn't work. But how can I create something great that many people would want and then create varying levels of approximation to this, which then adds in the last piece here, which is everybody who's over that 10 gets a recording.
(05:27) Top 10 guys get to be in person with their questions answered and a dinner. The top 50 get three hours and a shot at getting their question, but they're still in person and they still get the experience. If you're in the just 10 plus opt-ins, you're going to get an audiobook. You're going to get a shot at getting in the room, and you're still going to get a recording, which is an approximation of that.
(05:44) So, I try to think, how could this be something that would benefit their audience and benefit them and lad our way up to performance? I'll spend two days on just coming up with this stuff. The amount of different permutations we came up with to try and make this clear and simple and compelling and beneficial to every party was tough.
(06:04) But now we fit it in and you're like, "Oh, well, it seems obvious now." It's like it always seems obvious in retrospect. And so when you're thinking about yours, it's like this is the highest leverage thing you can do. If you make the offer good enough, you can get you can move mountains. So now that we have our offer, the next thing that comes up, how are we going to tell people about this offer so that they sign up for it? So that brings the next thing up.
(06:25) Now that you have the offer, you have to put a place that people can find out about it. And so what we did is we built an affiliate sales page. All right? So, it is exactly what it sounds like, which is we have to sell people on why they should become an affiliate or why they should refer their friends to our thing.
(06:40) An affiliate sales page is fairly straightforward. It's just explaining each of the prizes and exactly what they have to do and how we're going to help them do it. For us, I already went over the prizes. The what they have to do is they have to opt in, right? So, they just put their name and email, etc., and then they submit this. And what happens is they then get a little link that they use to then rank on the leaderboard and send all their traffic through.
(07:02) It's like, okay, that's the how. Now, what else am I going to do? Well, one is I'm going to support them. And the other thing is that once I know how I'm going to support them, then once I have this whole machine together, then I'm going to start promoting it. So, the way that we're going to support the affiliates is that we actually write them emails and posts and ads that we have already pre-approved and written that we already know worked because we did it last year.
(07:24) And so we give them all of these ads, posts, and emails to send to their lists that they don't have to do any work, right? You don't want to have be like, "Okay, go make a campaign for me." It's like, that's a big ask, right? But if I said, "Hey, here's some posts we already know work. Here's the ads that already worked.
(07:36) Here's the emails that already work." People like, "Okay, cool. I'll just copy and paste these and maybe change a couple things." I want to make it easy to become an affiliate to get the benefits. So, we give this. Now, on top of this, because I'm a maniac, what else do affiliates want? At least in my audience, a lot of them want to know what's happening behind the scenes.
(07:53) While the actual launch is going, one of the exclusive benefits we give to our affiliates. So, this is like maybe you could say it's related to this offer, but it's kind of like a like a dotted line is that behind the scenes, we're actually sharing how each email is doing, what the what ads are performing, and so they can actually kind of follow along so that when they want to promote whatever it is that they sell, they can actually learn the process from the outside in, which I think is really cool and probably one of the most underrated components of
(08:16) becoming an affiliate. Now, once we have that plus our BTS breakdowns, now we have our machine. And so, now what do we have to do? We got to promote the hell out of this thing. And so, we're not just going to promote it in one place. We're going to promote it in many. So, the first thing that I'm going to do is I'm going to email my list.
(08:33) And you don't want to do this a ton because, hey, I mean, I want to promote the book, not promote promoting the book, right? And so, I do this two times. Just one saying, "Hey, FYI, we have this. And by the way, in case you missed it, that's it. After that, I'm not going to talk about it again.
(08:49) All my focus is going to be on the actual launch itself. That's number one. The second place that I'm going to look is last year's affiliates. Now, some of you guys might not have this, but I just want to be transparent and complete here. Is that I want to say, okay, well, we had 30 something thousand affiliates last year who promoted our stuff.
(09:04) I'm going to say, "Hey, you did this. Want to do it again?" If you liked how it was last time and you liked having the behind the scenes, you like the bonuses, you like competing for stuff, which automatically just makes the whole event more fun because you know that you're in the drawing, do you want to do it again? Let's run it back.
(09:17) And so there's going to be people that I'm going to email here one or two times separately as well. I feel okay emailing them extra because they already opted in to be an affiliate before. So I'm not emailing the whole list, just this very small segment. Now, what else are we going to do? Every single person who opts in for the book, this guy, our product service, is going to then have the option to at the bottom, if they say, you know what, I just pre-ordered the book and now I'm at the thank you page where it gives me the reminder sequence to make sure that
(09:45) I show up for the event. If it says, hey, do you want to send anybody else or you have an audience? Uh, would you like to get more free prizes? If they click the button there, it takes them to the affiliate sales page. And so all of these traffic sources are going to one place that then feeds into the machine where they get the behind-the-scenes training of what we're doing, plus the actual deliverables that they can get all so they can win these prizes.
(10:08) Now, on top of this, to make this the most meta thing ever, this video is also something that is for affiliates. So, this is the affiliate YouTube video, which is both me explaining how it works, but also showing how the machine is being put together as I'm putting it together, which by the way, when you pre-order for the book, if you already have on the thank you page, there's a button at the bottom.
(10:29) You can hit it and you go to the affiliate sales page. And I'll probably put the link somewhere here or here somewhere, magic that you can go to sign up. All right, very simple. By the way, if you're thinking about this, it's like, okay, what are all the advertising methods that we're using? We are using warm and cold outreach via us reaching out to our existing affiliates to see if we can bring the high leverage people on. Email is also the same thing there.
(10:52) Posting free content. That's what this is. That's what this video is. I'm not running ads to get affiliates because I'd rather just focus on the book and let that flow come in through here. So, I guess technically I am running ads to get pre-orders for the book and registrations for the book, but then it ultimately still leads to promoting the book itself if you were going to do it anyways.
(11:13) And we use all of these core four in order to get the affiliates. And then the affiliates we then spin the same things for them. How do you make posts? How do you make emails? How do you make ads so that they can do the same thing for us. So that is the cycle of the core four and the lead getters being done together. You tell people about your stuff and then other people tell people about your stuff.
(11:32) That's the game. So now that we know what our offer is and we know how we're going to build the machine and we know how we're going to promote the affiliates, well, we can't just expect that they're just going to be like, "Oh, great. I'm just going to magically promote all your stuff. Of course not.
(11:44) And again, this is another place where businesses follow up. So, if any of the three steps I went over you weren't doing for your stuff, well, you could just stop right there. It's not going to work, right? You have to have every one of these pieces. If you expect people to actually promote your stuff, you got to make it worth it for them.
(11:55) You got to let them know about it. And you got to make it easy. So, what do we do? So, number one is we want to have some sort of onboarding plus activation. The simple thing is obviously, well, you got to opt in. Fine. That's the first thing you do. The next thing is if we can get any other data on the affiliates that helps us out so we can help them out, we'll do that too.
(12:14) The next is we want to have some sort of fast reward, right? And so the way that we do that is they get their custom link because if they don't believe that you have good attribution tracking, they're like, "Wait, why am I going to send all this track if I don't know that you're actually going to count it for me?" So we have to have a custom link that they know and we have to demonstrate that we have good attribution.
(12:31) Now, the way that we do that is through a leaderboard. So we want to show in real time that their stuff is getting tracked and they can know how they stack up compared to everybody else. So the next thing after we give them the onboarding, they get their custom link, they get attributions, they're like, "Okay, they're all set up.
(12:45) " Is we give the collateral. So I talked about this briefly before, but I want to make this like a very big point because this is where a lot of people fall off again. Is that if you expect them to make an entire campaign to launch your thing, good luck. It's not going to happen, right? So it's like you have to make it fast and easy.
(13:02) And so what we do is one is there's the regular communication. Now part of that is just awesome and fun because anybody who markets or sells stuff like love I mean I myself included I love to know like what are the winners? What's working now? Like what are some of the stats? Like that's the stuff that we share behind the scenes and I think that generates like a ton of interest or at least it did last year.
(13:18) People really loved it and honestly we enjoy doing it because it's like we can't share any of this stuff and so it's like cool to at least share it with some people who who dig this thing. So regular communication is one of them but the other is is knowing the winners. All right.
(13:30) And so this is where we create the blackbooks. This is all the collateral that you will use plugand play that you can use into your marketing again and it's going to be all of the different ways to market content ads outreach via email typically right and when we have all those things including test messages which we also give so that people can message their threads their slacks at work so that people just don't have to think about it.
(13:53) This is another thing that makes them more successful. And one of the other benefits here is that if we, you know, write the collateral, then we know that everything is being represented properly. So it's not like this is going to be get rich quick. Like no, of course not, right? But we want to make sure that we're just, you know, that the messaging is aligned, that everyone who comes in is expecting the same things so that we can deliver on expectations.
(14:10) And included within that is some obvious like compliance guidelines. Don't promote anything like don't don't lie. That's basically all it comes down to. Don't lie. Don't exaggerate. Just state the facts, tell the truth, and everyone will be fine. We actually break the collateral into two pieces. So basically we have this is what we're starting with.
(14:27) Then as time goes on we say hey here are the winners. And so that means either new ads that we're doing or we can at least take here's all the stuff that you know we're starting with and then here's the stuff that's really converting. And then that way the affiliates can double down on what's working and use your data to win for their audience.
(14:41) And then if you're like well what's the regular communication? Well there's two components to the communication. One is cool stuff right which is here's the neat stuff here's the data. All that jazz right? That's the That's kind of thing one that we announced. The next is we have the leaderboard, which you absolutely need to send out as frequently as possible because believe it or not, people want to check that thing daily.
(15:01) Anybody who's actually competing wants to know, you know, where they're at, right? They want to know if they're doing okay. And so this gives them that way of giving a feedback loop of you're doing a good job, keep doing what you're doing. And then as people move up the leaderboard, typically my director of marketing, my team will actually talk to the top ones as they kind of move up and filter the board so that we can help them do even more.
(15:20) So it's like kind of almost an additional unstated incentive is that if you crush it, we want to help you crush it even more. So one of the really important things that we that we like to think of is who are quote affiliates because affiliates like there's different words in different industries for the same thing. So fundamentally anybody who promotes your stuff is a promoter.
(15:40) Now some people like in the physical products world they call them influencer advertising. If it's customer-driven then it's UGC. It's userenerated content. If it's in the kind of direct response world, they call them affiliates. What the hell? And you know, in the brick and mortar world, they just call them referrals. In the finance world, they call them uh uh centers of influence, COIs.
(15:59) Uh in other places, they call them joint ventures. Like the number of names for the exact same thing is exhausting. But all they fundamentally are are people who tell other people about your stuff for some reason, money, free stuff, or just because they love the product. When I'm thinking through this, it's like I want to make sure that for every type or genre, I can speak their language.
(16:17) I want to make posts frame my stuff for people who have warm audiences on Instagram or YouTube or you know that in terms of how they're communicating in a specific way so they can use it. Right? If you're somebody who has an email list and you're more textbased info, you've got a substack, you've got a you've got you're on X, you're on LinkedIn, you do more blog style stuff, it's like that I want to make sure that I can set you up.
(16:38) If you're somebody who's just a really good advertiser, some guys just, it's funny because last year I had, some of the top guys were just, they're just really good at paid ads. They didn't even have any of this stuff. They're just like, "Oh, I'll just take the ads. I'll run them. I know I can just make my way into the top 50.
(16:49) " It's exactly what they did, right? And so, it's like I want to make sure that those guys are taken care of by giving them the ads that I know that are working that are pre-approved. They don't have to I have zero friction. They just take them, run them. As you're building this for your business, it's like you want to make sure that you're taking care of every single type of affiliate because as soon as there's friction, they'll stop.
(17:05) And so, it's like you want to make it easy. You want to make it fast and you want to make it personalized to them. If you want to sell something using other people's audience, which is free with the caveat that you give them some strong incentive to do so, then the first thing that we start with is why the hell should they do this? Which is you have to make the offer for the affiliates.
(17:27) And you want to make the offer beneficial for you, beneficial for them, and beneficial for their audience so that it doesn't feel like an ask from them to their people because you don't want to take away from them. The next is, okay, once you build that offer, it's like, how do you how are you going to tell people about it? Well, you got to have some place that exists, you have some sort of promotion, and then you have some sort of followup.
(17:45) All right? And so, the place that exists, I like having an affiliate sales page, an influencer sales page, a partner page, a center of influence page, a JV page, whatever you want to say or call it. People letting other people know you sell them on why it's a good idea for them to do it. Now, beyond that, it's like, okay, now we got to let people know about this thing.
(18:02) So, for me, I use the same ones. I use my outreach, which is talking to people who already know me. I make my posts for content like this video. And I'm going to be running ads, which I'm actually just flowing through our existing funnel. That's going to be to pre-order and register for the book. All of that that then ends up here so that it spins the loop of getting other people to ideally and hopefully promote the book.
(18:20) It's going to be awesome. You should totally do it. Once we have that, we can't just like leave them to flounder. We have to make sure that they actually succeed. And so we have onboarding activation with fast feedback loops. They immediately get their custom link. They know it's going to work.
(18:33) they see regular leaderboards so that they know that they're moving up or that they're doing well. And then beyond having the feedback loop, we want to give them the stuff, right? We want to give them regular communication which is going to be the data and the cool stuff that's happening behind the scene plus the leaderboard obviously.
(18:46) And then the winners is going to be like the ads or the posts or the angles or hooks that are outperforming. And so by doing this, we set as many people up as humanly possible for success. And then at the very top end for the people who are in that top 100 or top 50, my team actually reaches out to them and says, "Hey, how can we help you promote it and crush it even more, we want you to win? Because if you win and your audience wins, we all win.
(19:08) " And so fundamentally, that's how you advertise for free. It's also one of the most scalable ways to advertise in any niche. It's been one of the the core pillars of how I advertise. I mean, like school, the majority of the traffic is from people telling people about it. Allen was almost entirely my software company that we sold was almost entirely off of affiliates.
(19:25) Prestige Labs is almost 100% affiliate sales, meaning the brick-andmortar distributors who are actually selling the stuff at their brick and mortars. And so it doesn't matter also whether the people who like, for example, for me it's like I probably do have some gym owners who have 100 members at their gym, will they win the top 50? Probably not.
(19:43) Can they make sure that they get all the 10 plus and get a shot at getting in? Absolutely. Right? And so I want to make sure that somebody at the bottom and at the top can still win. And if you follow this stuff, you'll probably do pretty good. And if you want more details um about this, I have a monster chapter on affiliates, which I actually had to cut in half to even fit in the book because there's so much stuff to really do it right.
(20:06) Um that's inside of the leads book in the affiliates chapter. You can go check that out. With that being said, if you are an affiliate, you can click this link and you can become one. Or if you just want to send your friends, you just want to send your employees, you just want to send your gym, you want to send your pickle ball buddies, you want to send human beings who like in who like business to the event, I would love to give you free stuff to do it because I'd rather help you out rather than, you know, give a king's ransom to the social
(20:28) media platforms. So maybe that's our way of banning the

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video i'm going to be talking to you about how to fix the character traits and deficiencies that you have in your life so whether it be struggling with anxiety or happiness and depression or being a bad husband or being money focused or whatever the thing is that you claim to have a problem with i'm going to give you really the only mental framework that has ever worked for me if you're new to the channel my name is alex from rosie i own acquisition.
(00:29) com to portfolio of companies is about 85 million a year i make these videos because candidly i enjoy sharing some of the things that have helped us kind of get through things as we've grown our companies and there are a lot of people who are broke and i don't want you to be one of them and so i'm going to probably piss a lot of people off in this video so i'm going to give you a heads up second thing is i will be cussing in this video so if you have kids around um i would say you know mute it or listen to it another time so i was talking to
(00:50) an entrepreneur the other day and uh they were saying that they were having panic attacks right and they were struggling with this issue what i want to do is walk you through um the process that i was explaining to them now at this point they uh the reason the the panic attacks started uh for this entrepreneur ironically um is that they were talking to a therapist and the therapist was like let's look at your past and dug up you know crap about their past and then they started looking at this thing and then they started
(01:17) getting you know anxiety kind of remembering all these these kind of past experiences and whatnot here's the thing most therapists and i say this with zero degree most therapists are humans and most humans suck at most things especially things they think they're good at and so most of them are just normal people who did okay in school and now just like talking to people and don't have any [ __ ] clue what they're doing all right so here's the deal here's the hot take what most of them will do is they will try
(01:44) and pull something up and say something to the extent of what do you make that mean what does that mean to you the thought process behind this is hey you have this thing it's triggering a feeling it's because you think that having anxiety makes you a bad person or makes you a bad entrepreneur or whatever thing that you say it has meaning right what do we make this mean all right that's the question what are you making this mean all right so if you have problems and this is especially important with cyclical behavior
(02:11) reinforcing behavior this is also one of the reasons that i actually do not stand for the whole aaa concept of standing up in front of people every morning and say hi everybody i am an adult i [ __ ] hate it it's literally like owning this deficiency and incorporating it and weaving it into your contract and your identity and you reinforce it every [ __ ] morning it's insanity to me the way to stop being addicted to something is to stop thinking about it like what does it look like to not be addicted it looks like you just
(02:40) continuing to live your life not even thinking about it what does it look like to not have anxiety it's not you doing your anti-anxiety routine in the morning and saying i suffer from anxiety or i struggle with anxiety it's not saying that and saying i have to do these things i must i should i i need to in order to not have anxiety because then you're thinking about anxiety you give anxiety power and so what i'm going to walk you through is the way to hold the space and own the power that you have in your own mind outside of the
(03:10) thing that you were projecting the power onto the process that these therapists that are [ __ ] retards will do is they will lead you through this thing where they try and transform meaning they say instead of saying it means you're a bad person what if we just said this is you know it's a good thing or it's not a bad thing right so we're trying to transform meaning and i think that's like level one elementary you know grade school of of cognitive behavioral therapy right i think that's grade school but the thing
(03:37) is and this is the problem because i've gone through the cycle which is why i'm speaking about this so passionately and i'll tell you a quick story before i dive in so there was a period of time in my life where i was very unhappy all right and so i obsessed about happiness right i read all the positive psychology journals i read the the books i read the happiness equation i mean like i went through all of these things and yet after spending all of this time trying to obsess about happiness i was no less no more happy and so then i thought to
(04:04) myself well in one instance i can spend lots of time and effort and be unhappy or i can spend zero time and effort and be unhappy well this one cost me less i might as well start pursuing this and this is what happened i adopted this mentality and i will share it with you called [ __ ] happiness all right bear with me and so what ended up happening is that i thought these thoughts and and whenever uh the idea of is this making me happy and all of these normal trigger thoughts i'd be like oh i'm not happy this isn't good i feel sad blah blah
(04:33) blah blah i would literally have this trump card that i would just pop in my head and be like [ __ ] happiness and i keep moving the difference between [ __ ] happiness and let's think about how we should be grateful for things is that when you say [ __ ] happiness or [ __ ] the thing that you are struggling with [ __ ] anxiety [ __ ] whatever is that it no longer has power because we're not trying to transform the meaning of the behavior we're eliminating the meaning behind it all together we're transforming it
(05:05) into nothing and so hear me out for a second and i don't know why this is getting all spacey and weird i've tried to fix this thing a hundred times the reason this is so important all right is that when you enter these vicious reinforcing cycles so let's say it's like oh god uh i'm afraid i'm gonna have a panic attack tonight i don't wanna have a panic attack you start thinking about having a panic attack and then of course you have a panic attack because the fear of the thing is what reinforces the cycle and you can do this with
(05:30) anything right it could be it could be a guy with erectile dysfunction like i hope it doesn't happen i hope it doesn't happen and then it happens right because you're worried about it happening not because the happening itself is the thing right and i'm trying to use examples that purposefully people derive shame from because the thing is is that the shame of the occurrence is the thing that gives it power and so if you remove the shame and by the way the way to remove shame is to shed light on it so nothing can give you shame if you
(05:57) admit it openly think about it if everyone knows the thing and you accept the thing or deem the thing meaningless then it no longer has powerful over you so let me let me give you an example so this entrepreneur that i was talking about earlier they were telling me that they were having you know they're having anxiety taxes preventing them from sleeping etc right and i was like so they're like well you know i'm really working on it i was like why and they like looked at me cross-eyed and i was like how long have
(06:27) you been working this you know like you know eight months and i was like are you less anxious than you were before they're like well i think a little bit and i was like do you think you would be a little bit less anxious if you just did jack [ __ ] and waited eight months from when you went from when you were bad until now they were like well maybe i was like time does heal lots of wounds i was like so you spent all this time to get this little outcome and you could have just let time happen and probably had the
(06:48) same outcome right right i was like but let's take it one step further why didn't you tell me how many bowel movements you had yesterday i mean i didn't think it was relevant exactly so why are you sharing with me that you have panic attacks because you think it's meaningful you derive meaning your brain is telling you that this is something that is a problem so the thing is is that the deeming of the thing a problem is the problem and trying to change it or transform the meaning into something else is in my opinion just as bad because the
(07:23) way that you created the mess that you are in in a vicious cycle of reinforcement is that you found a thing and then you said i will give this meaning and then you spent the rest of your time trying to transform the meaning when if you want to solve the problem the experience of having the problem solved is to not think about the problem at all what it is is actually reversing the process that created meaning to begin with which is removing meaning altogether i'm saying this because i've had so many things that
(07:50) i've struggled with in my life that i would consistently obsess about over and over and over again oh i don't want to have that happening ah i don't want to have that happen again and then it would happen and so in my opinion the only way to overcome these issues is to you can you can slap the [ __ ] happiness concept on it but is to destroy the meaning of the thing itself and let it shrink into irrelevance most my opinion most of the psychological problems that we deal with are better dealt with not by trying to directly combat them
(08:24) but by not giving them the power of our attention and there's a big difference here i'm not saying the thought of anxiety comes up you say oh i don't want to think about it because then it's fear fear gives it power shame gives it power it's not that it's looking at it and saying why are you bringing this up this is irrelevant this is a non-issue and so for the same reason that you can have noise in the background and you don't think about it is that it's just noise and so what we do is we shrink the thing from being a signal that our
(08:53) brain deems meaningful to noise that is in the background that we no longer ascribe meaning to altogether and that is how it eventually shrinks into a relevance and then we only choose to allocate our attention towards the thing that we find meaningful right and so when what happened in my little [ __ ] happiness story is that i said this is no longer a productive conversation i'd be like i'm unhappy like [ __ ] happiness whatever i'm gonna keep moving and a funny thing happened a few years later i looked up and i
(09:22) realized that i was significantly more happy than i was before or as i prefer to say i was significantly less unhappy which also gives less power to the thing altogether a different point that i want to bring up because i think it's equally important around this this topic a lot of the fear and the shame comes from perceived judgment that we have from an anonymous outside society right we have a voice or a series of voices that we believe exist that only exist in our mind that are judging us based on this behavior that we are suffering from one
(09:53) of the reasons that i like to own the deficiencies publicly is not because of you guys it's for me i own like for example when i had uh you know when we were we were running and growing our our first big business which is the licensing business i was always up front i said i'm here to make money and the reason i said that was so that i would have no shame in making money because then if people in the future were going to say something like alex is only here to make money i would then look at them and say and so here hear me out
(10:26) listen to this dialogue let's say i was attacked because the attacks that i'm saying i'm going to portray as though it's outside but it's inside of our minds that we attack ourselves right so let's say somebody comes up to me a woman and says you're a terrible husband most people say that there are two forms of defense against this number one is saying no no i'm not a bad bad a bad husband right and then giving all the reasons why i'm a good husband the other way to defend against that would be to say well you know being a husband is not
(10:54) necessarily such a bad thing right and so one is to dispute the other is to alter right we're altering the meaning behind the thing the first is we're combating and we're saying that we're not the thing but still allowing the thing to have meaning allowing a bad husband to be a negative connotation that we ascribe meaning to i think this is meaningful and i it's negative but meaningful and so i will say i am not that thing or version two is this thing is meaningful but i i understand it and interpret differently right those are the two ways
(11:24) the second way is how most therapy works and i also think that it's [ __ ] and so here's door number three is that you look at the thing in the face and you say and i think you're a bad husband and you're right and and watch them shrivel they will be paralyzed because everything that they have exists to have a counter force but if there is no counter force for it to react to the thought process stops and so if you struggle with these vicious recurring consistent dialogues and and arguments in your head about what's good
(12:04) and why should change and why you need to be different and why this shouldn't be this way just look at it in the eyes and say and and i'm going to give you a really controversial example of what i think should have happened in a public scenario tiger woods he was outed you know what i mean or ousted or whatever it is you know what i mean he was publicly shamed for the the cheating thing right and mind you this is not me condoning cheating this is me to illustrate a position of power and this is a public demonstration of
(12:34) power but you can take it in terms of how you can internally project that power onto the idea that you want to vanquish all right and we don't vanquish it by transforming it we vanquish it by eliminating the meaning altogether and letting it shrink into irrelevance so what tiger in my opinion should have done in that situation when they said you banged all these girls and you were lying and blah blah blah he should have said yes i'm a liar and a cheater but i'm the best [ __ ] golfer there is next question what do they
(13:05) say when you accept it there is no conversation and so try this in the next argument you have with someone a but more importantly with yourself is that someone says i think you're x y and z and you said you're right just give the power just just say sure you're right now what and so your point when your brain tells you something that you don't like or that you don't want to look at instead of trying to make it into something else liking it to an irrelevant observation brain why didn't you bring up that i have brown hair because it doesn't
(13:43) matter brain why didn't you bring up how many bowel movements had yesterday this doesn't matter brain why didn't you say tell me how many uh how many stairs i went up yesterday because it doesn't matter you don't find it meaningful and so why am i now deeming this thing to be meaningful it's irrelevant to me it's it it halts the conversation and it stops the cycle i say this and i know that i got passionate about this but i say this to someone who struggled with this for a very long time and so the only psychotherapy that i was
(14:18) able to do was on myself and it was not through talking out all of these things and i know that a lot of people get triggered a lot of people are going to say hey i have a therapist they changed my life good for you that's awesome keep doing it i don't care what i'm doing is i'm trying to talk to the people who have not had that or have done that and it and it did not work for them all right and so i'm sharing the single most powerful mental model that has worked for me which is purposefully staring at the problem and
(14:44) saying so what your move and watch it shrivel and then moving on the [ __ ] with your life so anyways i love you all mozy nation appreciate you thank you for giving me the attention that you did today i make these videos because i just i i i hope that some of the lessons that that that have served me uh can serve some other people at least and if you're in a darker place or you're struggling with something like anxiety or struggling with shame around some sort of activity that you have done i can tell you the only way to struggle
(15:17) to deal with shame is to shed light on it shade shame only exists in darkness and the only way something has power is when we fight it because we deem it meaningful or worth combating and so i think the only way to truly fight it is to not fight it at all and say it is not a fight worth having and then it will evaporate and so anyways my friends keeping awesome lots of love i'll see you guys next video bye

This ONE Thing Will Make You A Better Entrepreneur - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) the one thing that limits every business is the entrepreneur not the opportunity not the business vehicle not anything else it's the entrepreneur everything stems from them it's there's three things you've got the skills of the entrepreneur the character traits of the entrepreneur and then you have what I would call the beliefs of the entrepreneur is what do they believe about the world to be true and what do they believe about the world to be true that isn't we have so many of these belief statements that like quote
(00:21) Society or things that we inherit but we just choose to say that this is how life is the easiest way to think about this is an analogy which is if you imagine a ladder right which you've got the ladder of success skill on one side beliefs on the other side then you've got character traits in the middle as the rungs you might have a tremendous amount of skills and great character but your beliefs are limited if all of a sudden you see somebody have an overnight success it's usually because they had two of the
(00:43) three already very very high level but they were missing some huge part some belief was wrong so for example for me when I went from 2 million to 7 to just under 30 in a matter of like 3 years I believe things that were true of the world that weren't and I didn't know that licensing was a model I didn't know I could expand in that way and in so doing I was able to explode because I got into the right vehicle the vehicle wasn't limiter it was me and my beliefs about it and then as soon as I changed the way I saw the world I was able to
(01:06) get into a much better vehicle and explode from there the skills we learn through education education comes from repeatedly doing things and learning from that experience the information that we acquire to learn things comes in a lot of different forms now the things that I actually invested in workshops books seminars coaching programs one1 tutors oneone mentorships and Google Google and I would say if I had to allocate uh amount of time spent learning things Google was still by far the biggest one it's funny the other day
(01:38) I just set up this new widget for our site I Googled it and I did it in two hours and so I think that the amount of time that elapses between wanting to figure something out and doing something the more advanced you get shortens I remember it took me 3 years to figure out how to build a landing page and the day I decided to do it it took me 4 hours so took me 3 years and then 4 hours to actually figure it out because I was avoiding the feeling of sucking and so if you can confront sucking fast and just get over that idea that sucking
(02:02) is a bad thing then I think you compress the time between you and the skills you want the highest value I've gotten from is from one-onone mentorship is from people who are far ahead of me that were willing to speak strategically into my life and that's usually because those people can identify all three of those things they can identify skill deficiencies they can identify character trait deficiencies and they can identify things that you believe that are true that aren't so that is where I've gotten the most leverage in my life is on and
(02:21) I've paid 20 $30,000 an hour to many many different people just to have them speak into my life right underneath of that as I was coming up was joining masterminds it was the getting around other people because for me it was very lonely and so just being around other people doing things it a got my competitive drive up because I always wanted to be the best and seeing people that I didn't think were like better than me do something better than me gave me hope that I too could do it I'd see somebody be like I don't think they were
(02:46) harder than me I don't think they've got like some genius brain if they can do it I can do it too also when I was in those communities they would also already have sifted through information for me because there's lots of information out there the problem is that we have limited time so it's no longer about oh information's free you can find anywhere it's not free it costs time to go find where it is and so the idea is when you pay someone for information it's not you're paying for the info you're paying for the time took them to sort through
(03:06) it to hand it for you so you're cutting time that's what you're saving when you exchange the money that's the idea and I think a lot of people don't get that this is the actual order that I bought things so the first thing that I did I did free interviews so I tried to reach out to people so I just said hey I'll show you the stuff that I've got you want to share notes with me I can drive out there we can meet up and that's how I learned a lot of my initial stuff usually was older guys who were willing to like you know take a young young buck
(03:27) under their under their wing if you're young the advantage you have is that you're young you can get a little bit of that Goodwill from older guys that you might not normally get if they're the same age people were like well the millionaire won't let me pick his brain he like well no his time's more valuable than yours either pay them or you have to go down a run you have to keep going down until there's somebody that's either a peer or just slightly ahead of you who you can provide value to in a very narrow way the next one I
(03:46) did is I I joined a mastermind that was $10,000 and that was Sam backyard's Mastermind rest in peace and he actually took enough of a liking to me that he said why don't you just become my apprentice and then he started paying me so it's kind of weird so I paid him and then he paid me back so I work from 4:00 a.m.
(03:59) to 4:00 p.m. every day with him basically as his secretary and I learned a ton 3 months just like learning all these new terms sales copyrighting affiliate marketing I learned all the stuff just from him cuz he was in that world from there I started my first gym and I stayed in that gym Mastermind during the time I also bought a weekend workshop for uh Facebook ads I learned Facebook ads in a small group of 10 people in two days it was really valuable for me then I didn't really do anything for a couple years and then I went to traffic and conversion Summit so
(04:21) that was an event and I just learned more about Marketing in general I got introduced to different softwares that I then started using and then from there I kind of got more into the digital marketing world so I joined some master Minds in that world I didn't do coaching programs myself I actually ended up buying them for teammates I think the coaching programs are really effective to teach methods so if there's a method of acquisition you want to learn whether it's like YouTube ads or Twitter ads or cold calling whatever it is joining a
(04:43) coaching program by other people trying to learn the same thing from some who's good is a great way to fast trck your success it just gives you the accountability it helps you resolve problems faster what you're buying is speed it's not that you can't do it on your own it's that you can do it faster with help if you're trying to solve a specific problem finding specific coaching programs is really good if you've been stuck for a long time I think that's where like masterminds and one-on-one mentorship is more valuable
(05:04) because you probably have a strategic issue more than a tactical problem now the beliefs kind of get solved concurrently when you're in communities because the best way to break a belief is to see someone doing what you thought was not real and then have it happen a lot of people have heard of the Roger banister story first man to break a 4minute mile and then the next year 28 people or whatever it was broke the 4-minute mile and so the nice thing is that when you join these communities the biggest benefit is not even the coaching
(05:24) it's the beliefs that are broken and the things that you thought were false about the world that aren't and I remember there was a moment where I was in a mastermind and there was a guy making I think $350,000 a month and he got up there and he sounded like an idiot and L and I looked at each other afterwards we're like if he can do it we can do it that was when we weren't even doing that much money we were probably doing I don't know 20 $30,000 a month like it was not a lot of money so when I joined one of the first masterminds I wanted to get my
(05:46) money's worth I wanted to get as much out of this as I possibly could remember be everyone's number one student I talked to every single person in the M I set up a call with everybody and I was like hey I'm new I'm good at sales that was my first skill that I had I didn't have any I didn't know Market I didn't know ads I didn't know webinars I didn't know Ling I didn't know any of that stuff but I was like I know how to sell what I did was I just offered every single person to go over their sales script edit it the way that I would
(06:06) structure it and then rewrite them a sales script my way for free and I did that with everyone and then what happened is I had all these big stack of IUS and then I was like I want to get into internet marketing and I was like Johnny was good at landing pages hey Johnny remember I have to do that sales thing do you think you could help me with landing pages sure man of course okay what else do I need I don't know how to run ads hey Sarah you were really good at running ads remember that sales thing I helped you sure of course and I
(06:29) get one tutoring from everybody on the things that they're best at because I just gave everyone what I was best at that's how I did it you want to become the most valuable person in your network and then in so doing you gain access to everyone's Network like Joe Rogan doesn't need to network he just is Joe Rogan and so if he wants access to somebody he gets access to them because he is valuable I've never been a fan of like the networking hacks it just provide value to people for nothing and then you will have people who who owe
(06:51) you stuff you've got your skills you got your beliefs and then you've got your character traits if there's one that is the most important I do think it's character traits because the character traits are the Wellspring that the other things are are are founded upon if you don't have discipline you'll never be able to actually study anything consistently to gain the skill if you don't have focus and you're always building a new bridge every week about the new business that you're going to do it doesn't matter how many skills you
(07:09) have and the beliefs you have about the world Zuckerberg couldn't start 17 Facebooks you could only start one and you have to stick with it and so that takes Focus this is a really important point if you have a trait and this is where it's helpful to have communities of other people and ideally mentors Etc who can speak in your life and there's not even that many mentors who have the social awareness to say I don't think you have integrity I don't think you have Focus I don't think you have discipline I don't think you have work
(07:29) ethics I don't think you have Drive I don't think you have empathy I don't think you have patience like these are virtues these are character traits that people want to embody and so you're like how do you develop these traits you don't develop a character trait you act in accordance to what someone with that character trait would do and you do it despite being uncomfortable doing it so I'll give you an example I was walking the other day with Lila I was like God I'm so impatient I was labeling myself as impatient and i' I've probably that's
(07:55) been something I've believed my whole life I was like yeah I'm impatient I'm an impatient person I'm go go go go go but I also want to be a more patient person I want to be wiser I want to be more long-term thinking and she said you're not impatient and I was like what do you mean I was like all I want is for all this stuff to go faster and she's like yeah but you're not changing direction all your actions are one of somebody who is patient so the fact that you're uncomfortable being patient does not mean you are impatient it means
(08:19) you're just patient and so your internal feelings about what you're doing have nothing to do with the trait and so you think about the reverse of that where someone's like I'm super disciplined except they don't do anything that's disciplined you're like no you're not they're like no but I feel good like yeah but you're not disciplined you have no evidence to support that you were disciplined the idea of building a character trait is not do I have the character trait or do I not have the character trait it's to what extent do I
(08:40) have the trait and so if you can think about character traits that way then you can start reverse engineering the character traits that you lack and this is really hard because one of the things that I see with entrepreneurs all the time is it will happen is that they will feel bad about something and then they will want to change something in their business to make themselves feel better they take those emotions and then they try and feel better by erratic Behavior that's non-directional and then they break their original strategy the more
(09:02) willing you are to endure discomfort for an extended period of time based on a decision that you made in the past because you know it's better for your future means you are more patient character CHS even more than any of them are a pursuit of perfection that we will never attain but in understanding it that way you can see it as a journey of trying to stack up winds in your favor you do the thing and you do it so many times that at some point you look back and you realize you know what I do do this most of the time I guess I do own
(09:25) this trait and then you can label yourself as a patient man A wise man a kind man and I think in doing that you ultimately tap into the W spring that allows you to grow um beyond your dreams

I emailed myself all of my failures for the last 5 years...this is what I learned.. - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) for the past five years i've kept a documented email chain that i've called lessons and failures and in that chain whenever i have like a lesson that i feel like i've learned i would email it to myself with kind of the circumstance and you know the the lesson so i could document it and i've been doing that for five years this may be the last year that i do that because i've kind of transitioned to documenting my thoughts on twitter uh rather than an email chain to myself and so that's actually grown a lot because they were
(00:28) public rather than private and then consolidated but this video is far overdue because it is from the lessons and failures of 2021 and um you know perennially this lessons and failures videos tend to be like my number one video for the year and so i hope you enjoy it i'm going to be covering a vast you know big big swath of topics during during this video and just to give you a little bit of context uh my name is alex for mozy i own acquisition.com it's a portfolio of companies at this point over 100 million a year i make these videos because i'll be dead one day and
(00:59) that's all that's left and so just a couple of major bullets from 2021 i sold the majority stake of allen which was a software company that we owned 100 of it had done 12 million in trailing 12 months revenue we sold it to strategic buyer the terms and price of the deal i signed a nine disclosure four so i cannot share that part but we did 12 million leading into the sale we sold two thirds of uh of jim launch and prestige labs which was a company that we founded my wife and i to american pacific group at a 46.2 million valuation it was an all-cash
(01:27) deal for us there was no earn out there was no seller financing there was no transition period and those were the terms of that deal so i was able to do that and i negotiated in so i could tell you guys on this level youtube video in addition to that i wrote and published 100 million offers uh which to date is still the number one bestseller for advertising for now eight straight months or at least the time of this video um it has nearly five thousand five stars on amazon and a five-star uh 4.9 ranking on there which i'm very grateful for so thank you guys uh part
(01:52) of moza nation for for sharing the word i hope to continue to write more of these books i have a lot of outlines it's just very hard to make them exceptional and that's why they take so long that being said in the same 2021 we grew uh tik-tok instagram youtube all to over 100 000 into subscribers followers et cetera in a year and uh grew twitter uh to 20 000 and 90 days all of which without really any knowledge of these platforms so um i'll share some of the things that that worked for us if that is of interest to you guys despite the sale not including
(02:21) the sale money that we got from all three of those exits that i discussed we still did seven to eight million dollars of ebitda or like personal earnings um outside of the sale from real estate things like that and just from dividends from other companies we own i sold our bentley that was uh the only nice car that we owned we had an i8 but it was a gift we still have that we'll probably end up selling it because it's just not that practical and beyond that i also sold my home and so at this point i own no personal assets and i'm leasing my life
(02:50) and so that's kind of what happened last year so let's get to the lessons because you're like alex i don't really give a  about your accomplishments and i tend to agree with you we'll dive in together to some of the major topics i'm going to start with some heavy hitters and then we're going to get into the more tactical stuff one of the heavy hitters here is if we think about you know betty white have you heard of betty white she was one of the golden gals super successful actress uh she just died right before
(03:13) 100th birthday very sad and what's interesting is that she was kind of a meme all over the place that how she just missed it by like 14 days but what's interesting is that you probably haven't thought about betty white since then or you might not even heard of her what's interesting to me about that is that betty white achieved pretty much all levels of success she was a really nice person she was a huge human rights advocate she donated tons of money she was famous she had like she did everything right and yet you probably
(03:37) haven't thought about her except for me making this video right and i think in a lot of ways that's how our lives will be and it gives me a lot of perspective in the things that we find important and how much we value the opinions of others when most of them won't even remember after we die like even a few weeks later they don't need they'll just continue to live their lives and so if people don't even care for more than a few weeks that we died why do we ascribe so much value to how they want us to live and so that has been kind of one of the guiding principles that i've tried to think through with you know how i live my life
(04:08) and kind of this this next chapter and it's been it's been a great lens for realizing that most things just don't matter and that most of the meaning at least for me comes from the things that i choose to deem meaningful rather than a capital meaning that has been prescribed from everyone else and i'll share with you a quote that was very meaningful to me because again this was just a long email chain that i've sent to myself but albert camus was a french is a moroccan philosopher and he said the meaning of
(04:32) life is why you don't kill yourself and that will probably trigger a lot of people and that's not my intention but when i heard it so succinctly stated i thought about it i was like that might be one of the best messages i've heard the reason you don't kill yourself like right now you have a reason like why don't you do it like what is the deep core reason for why you don't kill yourself that reason is is your actual meaning that is the thing that prevents you from killing yourself and so that is the meaning for you and i thought that was really fascinating now obviously for people who have you know who follow a certain or
(05:01) specific faith that is going to be maybe the reason and if it's not the reason then that might not be your deepest held belief kind of interesting thought but for me that was uh very interesting and i'll share with you what the reason i don't which is i i just love learning and i just there's so much more to learn and that's really it i just love learning and i want to continue to learn because i enjoy it so much and i would be really bummed if i died because i wouldn't be able to learn all the stuff that i want to learn and then uh dispelling the legacy myth
(05:26) kind of once and for all my great great grandfather was a king or something in iran and maybe this is folklore but doesn't really matter because the the point of the message is the same i don't actually remember his name um i think it's hormoz han but doesn't matter the point is i don't remember his name and he was like royalty and he had 400 kids and he was a ruler and so think about that from like an achievement perspective he like ruled a country so wealth kids fame all of those things right and here i am only like five generations later and i can barely tell you his name i don't even
(06:00) know what he looked like right and so i mean he influenced my life in basically no way besides the fact that he i was pro-generated from him right and so we have these ideas of legacy and they are not real because if you just take out the time horizon for any reasonable period of time a thousand years ten thousand years we will be forgotten right there is no legacy and so the idea of like i want to build a legacy is silly unless you want to say that it's just well i'm going to leave an impact on people and those people even impact on people then cool then you just want
(06:29) to help humans and that's fine but the whole concept of legal legacy though is kind of superfluous it's kind of irrelevant it's just living your life according to your values which is great but i wouldn't necessarily call that a legacy i have taken the stance that it's very much a myth and that us accumulating assets is very much like a casino analogy that a lot of a lot of you guys have loved from mosination which is if you imagine life as a casino where as we come in or come of age we get a chip and we get seated at a poker table and we're dealt cards right and based on our skill we're able to continually
(06:58) hopefully amass chips over time um and continue to play and the difference between a casino uh in the real world and the casino of life is in the real world you can cash out your chips and walk away with more money but in the casino of life when the green river taps you on the shoulder and it says you it's time to go you get up from the table your chip's still on the table and everyone pushes it back to the middle and then everyone redistributes those things the lanes you own the bassets you own etc those just get redistributed new
(07:22) people own them right after you and i remember thinking about this when i had bought a piece of land and i was like this is cool i own this land and then i realized that that land had been bought from another guy who'd been bought from another guy who'd been bought from another guy every one person before me had been like this is mine but not really we just kind of lease it while we're alive and then we die and then we give it back and then someone else takes it right and so death taxes everyone 100 and so that thought process for me has led to you know the decision that layla and i had which is to give away our wealth when we
(07:46) die no matter what because we don't think it's good for anybody to inherit tremendous wealth because we think it ruins the person and if we're gonna give it back to humanity anyways then might as well just be more targeted in how we give it right and so that has been a lot of the thought process around like why do we choose to do what we do because it's one of the questions i get on interviews a lot which is like why are you still motivated to do it it's like well what else would i do i'm not going to just sit and drink puny class all day that would be terrible and the process of success for me is the process of
(08:10) becoming the becoming is the is the success and so hard work is the goal that is the goal hard work that we find meaningful and that is for me learning is meaningful and i learn by doing so that being said 2021 was also difficult for me because it was a year that i basically took off i did not work much at all and that was mostly to kind of have the full experience you know i don't want to say i don't want to poo poo not working without having not worked and after not working for almost an entire year i can tell you for me no
(08:37) bueno it was very sad for me it was very depressing for me i did not enjoy it i did not get any meaningful it just was it was not good very empty and so i'll give you a couple of quick conclusions that i had uh from that whole year um the first thing is that uh for me price of things no longer confers value which is actually kind of interesting because when you think about it in the beginning you can go out to a night restaurant and it's really fancy because it's a nice restaurant and so the fact that you're sacrificing so much to go out makes you enjoy it more if you save up to buy a purse if you're a girl then
(09:05) the purse is more meaningful to you but if you can buy a purse off of you know one minute's worth of income then a really nice purse or the most expensive purse off one minutes worth of income then the person no longer has that conferred value from the price and so what's interesting about that though is that it allows i feel like me now to look at things without price altogether because if all things cost essentially zero then you get to just purely look at things for what they are which is you take out the marketing you take out the
(09:28) psychology it's like do i like this thing does it serve me does it have function and so that has been kind of my outcomes razor for how i deem things more valuable to me so i realize that i prefer just simple cotton tanks because they are just easier for me and i like them i don't need more expensive tanks because i don't like them i like these ones right and if there's something that happens to be more expensive and i like it the best then i will get that right but price no longer confirms value if you don't feel
(09:52) like the price gives you status because you don't get your status from the expensiveness of the thing or the cost of the things that you wear kind of interesting next was um i had the realization that i had no way to actually spend the amount of money that we have accumulated over our lives that we continue to accumulate there's no real way to spend it like as in consume it like you can spend it to buy assets for sure but then those assets just make you more money and so buying things for the sake of consuming
(10:15) them there is a very easy limit that you reach where they're there you don't really get any more benefit and so realizing that there's a diminishing marginal return with money was like an interesting conclusion to like realize myself and i think what's interesting is that having more allows you to realize that you were just as happy when you had less and maybe you have to do that on your own and get there to let me prove it to myself as les brown says but to me it was it was just a very interesting you know kind of realization um the next one was as a result of this you know dealing with tax shenanigans as
(10:44) as i like to say um almost went down this path of building like these cascading trusts to decrease tax drag uh only exits that we had and i think it probably would have saved me somewhere in the neighborhood of about six million dollars was like i just don't care enough i'll just pay my taxes and um i already have more than i can i can spend or eat and move on and at the end of the day like for me i realize that the wealth is built through the owning and not the selling and so the goal is to just transact as little as possible and just continue to build value in the things that you do own because most things over a very long period of time
(11:15) just go up a lot and so it's all about patience and i like this is a quote that you can you can share but i like setting up games where if i wait i win and so those tend to be the games that i now am more drawn towards whereas i feel like when i was younger it was more like if i can't win fast that i want to play but now it's like i would love to have the games where you cannot win unless you wait because i know so few people will play and typically the rewards are outsized next one was just really
(11:40) thinking about ownership in general for personal belongings uh i have still dedicated you know a layla night now we own nothing we lease our lifestyle and i would say that it has been very freeing we thought about buying a house again and we actually ended up deciding not to do that and so we are just leasing our lifestyle and it is very freeing i will say that one of the things that i also have started asking myself as a question for framing what someone else who's ahead of me is doing and this might be useful for you is a lot of times i originally would look at what is this person doing that
(12:09) i'm not doing right and so it comes from the assumption that i need to do more right whereas if we come from the opposite perspective of what is this person lack that i have what is this person not doing that i am doing i think a lot of times there's more answers to that question that are more meaningful than trying to do more because at a certain point you max out your ability to do and if you're doing all day long right and you're not getting to where you want to go then what you're doing is the wrong
(12:34) stuff to do and so it's not about doing more because what you're doing is already maxed out it's about doing less and about doing different and so in order to do different if you're maxed out you must do fewer of the things you're currently doing and so that is a really good limits task for me to think through what are the character traits that someone might lack that i have what are the activities that they are do that are they are not doing that i am doing so that i can look through a different lens you know through which to improve
(12:58) myself and then the final one on on living stuff and this may have seemed a little bit more heady than some of my uh past lessons and failures but i think part of that was just because you know with the sale of all three businesses and the dividends and everything like we crossed the nine figure net worth at you know layla's 29 i'm 32.
(13:16) and so we have a lot of summers left hopefully and so it it gives you a little bit of perspective on like so what do i want to dedicate the rest of my life to and so the the last framework that i'll leave you with in the kind of the woo-woo uh-ness of this video is the 85-year-old decision framework which is instead of talking to an 85 year old which is a great thing to do by the way if i imagine myself as an 85 year old version of me and i ask that man for advice on what i should do in situations a he's an uh always making fun of me but beyond that i get really really clear answers from someone who wants truly just my best and i found
(13:48) this to be a repeated theme throughout my life is that a lot of times i know what i need to do and i'm just not doing it that may be true for you too is that a lot of times we don't have as much ignorance as we think we do we just have a lot more fear to take that action and so when i talk to my 85 year old self i get a lot of clarity in terms of what decisions i should make and more realistically how few of them really matter because when i think about my 85 votes off all he ends up telling me to do is like enjoy the enjoy it like
(14:12) you're gonna die and definitely don't sacrifice anything for me like i would give everything i have to be 32 again 85 year old self would give everything he has all the billions of dollars just to be 32 again and i have that gift right now and it's kind of interesting and so too many of you probably you know if you could if you could give up everything you have to get 10 year to go back in time 10 years would you do it and it's not to relive life from a regret standpoint but just to have 10 more years right of youth i think a lot of
(14:38) people would do that which then gives you a really interesting perspective on the value of money and how we trade it for time and living that was one of the frameworks that i've been really thinking a lot about when it comes to my life the next one is about solving problems which is a lot a lot of you guys know that i'm a huge fan of charlie mungers and one of the processes that he champions is inverted thinking which is or inverted problem solving which is rather than asking how do i want to solve this problem i try and destroy the solution so for example if i wanted to
(15:07) destroy my marriage what would i do right i would probably not be loyal right i would probably never compliment my wife um and i could you know the list would go on right and what's interesting about the inverted thinking process is that you think of far more ways that are threats to a certain condition than you do solutions naturally and i think it's because our brains are wired to think of threats right we're trying to survive not thrive but you can use and trick your brain into thinking of all of the
(15:29) threats that could possibly come up within a given situation and then all you do is reverse them right and so if you think how can i destroy my business you know as easily as quickly as possible what i do then you tell yourself what those things would be right and then all you have to do is reverse those and those become your strategic anchors those becomes the biggest priorities in the business that you need to do more of and so it's a really wonderful process that has taken me time to just you know immediately go to that you know first i had to think about it deliberately and then i saw the utility in using that framework and now i use it
(15:57) quickly you know it's more top of mind for me now that i solve more problems through inverted thinking but it takes time to get there and so that has been probably something that i've worked a lot on in 2021 that i hope serves you but you can really solve so many questions you know like if i wanted to make an offer or would i if i wanted to get something that no one would say yes to what do i do and then you put all the things down and great do the opposite of that right if i wanted to sell this person what would i do great what would i to make to guarantee that they would
(16:20) never buy what would i do right and so you you reverse it and then that gives you what you need to sell and so you can solve so many problems that way but i think it just it triggers a different part of your brain and you solve problems differently a few major lessons one is uh financing so we're gonna we're gonna go from clouds all the way to dirt okay so business business if you can find people the money to pay they will find a way to make it work and so i think that financing is something that is underrated i think the entire
(16:43) education industry at large exists because government gives basically free money to anyone who wants to get educated through student debt and student loans and so that whole industry probably would not exist if you know if that student loan thing didn't happen and so if you can find yourself in industries where there is easier lending you will sell more people at higher prices just interesting lesson that was a great reminder for me number two whenever possible especially within services sell to gold rather than selling programs uh and the reason for
(17:11) that is because people want to buy the outcome they don't want to buy your program so if someone wants to buy you know uh they don't want to buy your gym membership they want to buy a body they want to buy what their body's going to look like and so sell that it's a it's a very interesting nuance but it's really important when you're trying to you know persuade someone to take action and it be and it creates a clear line between their purchase and their desired end state and so rather than sell like i said you know a 12-week whatever sell the goal and so i think if you can make
(17:36) that shift uh in your products and services you ultimately sell more people and have happier customers moving along i read 70 books uh last year i barely read most of them i skimmed the majority and that was mostly because most of them were just not that interesting or that good um the books that i read intentionally last year so i would skim thought they had good stuff and then reread uh ready fire aim which i've talked about which is uh masterson uh stephen schwartzman's what it takes really good book conscious capitalism i
(18:01) read the first half but it was really good and it really shifted how i saw business and what we want to do with acquisition.com in terms of giving back and helping all stakeholders because i'll go on the tangent that this book led me to which is the realization that charity as a whole is a very broken model and so it's my belief and this is what my you know what i hope to accomplish with acquisition is that if we can create an entity that is self-sustaining and self-growing and continually gives a percentage of its earnings then
(18:30) we will have created a charity that grows and fuels itself rather than creating a charity that solicits money because the exchange just it's just not there it's always banking on goodwill rather than a value exchange from selfish people and so i think it's much easier to focus on people's as a large selfishness and then only have to get one person to be more giving right which you could make the argument that we're being selfish by giving but whatever if you only have to convince yourself to be giving and then convince everyone else
(18:56) to be selfish it's much easier to do that over a longer period of time than convince everyone else to give right that is kind of the perspective that has changed for me with regards to charity and giving overall and so laila and i have given millions now uh to charity and i feel like now that we've been involved there are things that i would want to improve and the only solution that i could think of was creating a true for-profit type business that would attract the best talent who could grow the thing and then dedicate a specific
(19:25) percentage of the profit every year no matter what that would go to the causes right and then that way as the company grew so too with the giving right rather than always soliciting all right so that's one of the things that the conscious capitalism gave to me i read everything uh that warren buffett and charlie munger have written i read that last year so there's the the shareholder letters um that uh buffett has written there's charlie munger's almanac and there's just basically anything they've written uh the transcriptions from all of munger
(19:53) speeches uh very very very very good very impactful for me and the almanac of naval ravicon that was a good book uh very easy read like two hours very very easy read um i think i read it again like literally right afterwards very good book very very good all i have to say about that very very good book now let's get even more tactical social media so um some of the things that worked for growing these social medias for us number one is only talk about stuff that you know or that you have experienced or that real for you um i think one of the things that i see at least turns me off when i see other people's stuff is i see people clearly
(20:24) regurgitating other people's content and it's like this has already been said and you're not adding to the body of knowledge you're just you know diluting down your version of it and it's just not that useful right it just it's not value additive and so it either has to be true because you've done it or it is true to you and i think that is a very good so like if you're starting out what's true to you is that you're trying and so that would be true and your experiences that you're going through are true and so that is kind of in accordance with the whole document
(20:48) don't create concept from garyvee which is very difficult to operationalize but at least just capturing the things that you're going through no one can no one can no one can claim that you are speaking false truths like no one can negate your truth of what you just did right if you did this thing or you helped this client that is true there's no way that anyone can can say that you didn't do that right and so you can give your unique perspective which is adding to the body of knowledge rather than regurgitating stuff that you read in a book right which goes down to if someone has
(21:20) already made it don't remake it next one is um i realize for me i don't want to have a schedule uh so what i mean by that is like i don't have a schedule for posting stuff uh i'm not a social media creator i i'm a business guy you know what i mean like we take investments in in e-learning and and really internet businesses uh is is what we focus on so you know that's where i make my money the schedule felt very constraining to me and when i didn't have the schedule i ended up making more and so that was something that i figured out for me was useful the next one was like why do you
(21:48) make stuff uh and i think i alluded to the beginning of this video but like making stuff there's obviously making stuff for you know the audience but i think for me it's making it for me making it to document so that when i look back and i'm old and gray and baggy and saggy i can be like oh yeah that's what i used to think about when i was at that point and it get it'll it'll help me document my what i'm thinking about at that time and hopefully maybe for you if you can shift that frame i think would be helpful and i heard this from
(22:11) grant that i really liked he said assume no one will ever see it and make it anyways right and so when he said that i thought that was like it corroborated the conclusion that i had gone to or come to it next one was uh you want to be platform specific for formatting uh that's something that we you know we found out like you just you got to be platform specific and so either learn the platform by using it or find someone who does that was very helpful for for us the next one is that people feel intention more than anything else and i think that was a big lesson for me
(22:37) because like i don't sell anything i have a book that's 99 cents that you can get on amazon because the cheapest they'll let me list it for is 99 cents and audible they don't even let you list your own prices they list the prices people feel intention right and so i think that people are always waiting for the other shooter job at least for me in my channel like when is he going to pitch or something like i have nothing to say right like unless you're a company in which case i'm buying not selling right and so the point here is if you're coming at it from the right place like people are
(23:00) exceptionally good at sniffing out why people want something right like we're very good at not being deceived like it's very good from an evolutionary standpoint to not get double crossed right and so we i think we have very good intuition to who is lying right and so the easiest way to get people to believe you is to tell the truth and if you do want to sell people stuff just tell them you're trying to sell them  right like in the companies when i like when we were selling stuff i was like i'm here to sell you i want to
(23:23) make money that's why i'm here and i do long-term want to make money from all the investments that we make which these videos do help with that to attract internet businesses but a lot of my opinion is the fact that i know that i'm going to die and it's not going to matter anyways and like this is fun for me tone like in selling matters more than words and that was something that i got to see firsthand i saw someone deliver a pitch that was really bad someone else basically go up and say the same thing with the right tone and that was where the intention came in and it crushed and i think that seeing that
(23:51) juxtaposition just showed me how much more the intention in the heart behind the action like humans are so good at sniffing out intention we can it's just so you have to be so perfect at lying it's impossible and so the easiest way to to become to become trusted is to be trustworthy right is to actually have people's best interest in mind and if you can't get that then like figure out a way to do that and then the selling will happen on its own the next belief that i had that was broken was that organic traffic is very worthwhile if you are patient you are good enough and i think that being good enough comes
(24:22) back to the stuff i started earlier which is only talk about stuff you know make sure it's true because you did it if someone else made it don't remake it like make it for yourself assume no one else is going to watch it and still make it anyways and at the end of the day i think this stuff has to be art because you make art because you believe it should exist not because the art's going to do something for you true art is made to exist because you believe it should exist because you believe the universe is better for it like you believe the body of knowledge exists as as a result
(24:46) of this thing if you're making something to do something it's usually not as good and people can sense it and i think that's where people fail with organic marketing uh which is just like earned media and i'll share this with you my my youtube team bro scott told me something uh that he said was like his biggest learning that i'm sharing with you from what he told me and he was like you have the you have the longest time horizon of anyone i've ever worked with it's like you just you're talking like you know five year and ten year time horizons for like whether we're going to deem something successful or not
(25:16) and i you know i guess sometimes you adopt these things and you get so used to it that you forget that other people don't think that way and so i guess i'm sharing it with you because he he seemed to think that it was something that was worth sharing but like time is everything like how you think through how long something is going to take because time is really just a function of your expectations of an outcome and so if you could extend the time rise into infinite then you basically remove your expectations and when you can create without expectations you usually end up
(25:44) creating better stuff and so it's one of those things where like you only gain your life when you choose to give it right you only achieve happiness when you decide that it's no longer a priority right and you just start to live and accept the moment for what it is and so i think that it's in a lot of ways it's similar that time horizons really feed into everything and the most successful people that i know have the longest horizons and in game theory the person with the longest horizon wins it's the difference between finite and infinite players and so you can literally give yourself an immediate
(26:12) competitive advantage simply by thinking i will outlast i will endure and i will be here for a long time and you build with that in mind right so what happens is you just you get rid of all the short-term plays like i was asked the other day like why don't you create a no strip line and i'm like because it's just not what's what's the point you know what i mean um maybe i'll change my mind later but like i just it's like short-term cash crap right and so i think it's all about being long-term selfish rather than short-term selfish and long-term self-esteem comes from
(26:36) just giving more than everyone else which ends up benefiting humanity which is great that humanity serves or rewards the people who give the most which i think is interesting moving along so we had coveted in 2020 2021 was the recovery for all three of our companies it taught me a very important lesson which is a buffett quote but market over manager which is it is more important the boat that you are in rather than how hard or how well you row and um you know our company was able to have a very strong recovery um as a result of that but it taught me that
(27:06) we were not supermen that we are fallible that we are that we can lose and despite how hard we row it's you can still have harder like you can still not achieve the outcomes that you want and so i decided you know when when when the flu hit or whatever that i was not going to like we were i was like we're not going to be affected by this like we've made i was like i've made the decision that we're not going to be affected by this but you know my decision did not really change reality and so it really was very humbling for me to see that like yes indeed market is stronger than the manager and so that is
(27:35) what you know spawned me to create the 55 minutes of becoming a millionaire that that presentation because it's all about opportunity vehicles and that was a great deal of my thinking last year in putting together what we were doing with acquisition.
(27:49) com another conversation that i had was with perry belcher um who told me a story and i think he's he's in i think he's 60. hopefully perry don't get upset with me maybe he's in his 50s i don't know and he said that when he looks back in his life he said three or four huge like where he was crushing it just home runs right where he was just hitting it out of the park business-wise he said every time he did it he thought it was because he was doing so well he said but when he looked back on it it was because he had hopped on a trend that was happening that he was unaware of and um he was like he was selling
(28:10) gold by the inch at some point like in his first big you know home run thing and it was because uh it was a it was gold-plated metal but it was because the cost of gold was so expensive and so he happened to hop onto a trend that he was unknowing of and so people wanted alternatives to gold right and so he was selling something that capitalized on a trend and it blew up and he's got a company now that does uh you know bookkeepers and va's and it's because cost of wages in the u.
(28:33) s has skyrocketed and there's a huge demand for offshore services and so he's just riding that wave and he said so you know as i've gone on he's like i've learned a market learn to sell i have all these skills and expertises but a lot of times i was just riding the market and so i think that i too have had a little bit you know i think i've had a little bit i've been a little more humbled by life that some of the biggest successes we had have just been luck you know i mean we were at the right place the right time the thing is is that when those occasions do happen uh swinging hard at that fat pitch because you don't know
(28:57) when the next one's going to come and so i think that that was something that we did well but i would urge you that if you are in something and something is growing is crushing it don't think it's because of you but do go all in and i think that you will be very happy with the outcome the market makes a lot of our success we feel smart or dumb and it has nothing to do with us the entire time uh was the little little email thread that i left to myself and so that was uh very interesting for me now next lesson in failure talent so a lot of stuff on hiring and building team because that was what was necessary for
(29:26) us to to sell and obviously build the hold code for acquisition.com so for context uh you know everybody in the hotel acquisition.com we've got harvard grads we've got uh mckinsey which is the number one consultant management consulting firm in the world recruits from there we have some of the best strategists from vanguard which manages six trillion dollars that we recruited in to really get the absolute best of the best people uh we had you know our cfo has been cfo of a 5 billion a 1 billion a 750 million dollar company she's been sell side exits 16 times so
(29:55) very very very very well-versed experienced team and so i've learned a lot about talent um the management the acquisition of talent and my perspectives on business have fundamentally changed from they were five years ago i used to think it was all about strategy now i think it's all about people and because if you find great people great people build great strategy and execute great strategy to build great companies you can't build a great company without great people and i just i just i just really i just didn't think that when i was younger i was like i can will power my way through it and it's just even if you
(30:25) can you can't do it forever or maybe you can i don't know but uh for me like at a certain point it wasn't worth it in order to scale like only one man only has two hands and so you have to have more hands and you have to have more people aligned with your mission and so here's some of the conclusions that i've had around talent um over the last however long better understanding of entrepreneurs versus entrepreneurs so i had a big you know i used to say like you need to find entrepreneurs not entrepreneurs silly it was a false binary entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs
(30:49) exist on a continuum you have some people here either more or less entrepreneurial and all of those things can change given a dynamic plenty of people were employees got laid off and coveted and decided to start making money on their own and then found out they did have an entrepreneurial streak right and so i used to think that this was much more like born and i think now that it's much more made and i never would have considered myself a big risk taker i did everything by the book you know for basically all my career and i was
(31:13) only very lucky that i hated my life so much that i was willing to quit everything uh to start a business but that is not common and it was still one of the hardest decisions of my life and seeing how easily some people quit their jobs compared to how long it took me to do it even when i had no stake i had no family i had no kids it was still the hardest decision my entire life i really do think more and more that entrepreneurs are made rather than born and it is again a continuum and that continuum can change uh where you sit on that continuum can change based on your
(31:37) circumstances right and so i think that there's this like he's a pure entrepreneur he's not a peer entrepreneur and to me i feel like it's like in this context for right now and that can change so that was something that i thought was interesting and in that way when we're recruiting talent i'm not really looking necessarily for entrepreneur entrepreneur it's just like is this person aligned with where we want to go and are they motivated intrinsically by getting there right if so then they will be entrepreneurial if
(32:00) we can create the environment such that those character traits come out and i'll tell you the one thing that sealed the deal for this is that layla's father is the or was the dean of the mechanical engineering department so academic you know all the way tenure the whole like literally the most secure security you know driven career path of all time and i remember saying i was like if he can start doing entrepreneurship i was like i will change all of my views because i mean literally like an engineer in academia tenure like it's
(32:27) just like all of the most security driven things and lo and behold here he is now you know starting his entrepreneurial dream that now that he retired and he's making money and i like i'm just filled with pride uh seeing that but at the same time it just it gave it just it was such a testament to the fact that we can change our stars we can be what we want to be and that was just such a big profound proof point for me that it really shifted the way i saw talent and entrepreneurship in general next one was uh in terms of finding talent it has now been my it's now my feeling that it's better to find a 400
(32:57) batter than to teach someone how to swing right i would rather find people who are really really good already and then orient them rather than try and teach someone how to do the thing right now you might not be able to afford that at a certain point in your business career but that is still the ideal that i would that would go towards and if you look at what you know steve jobs you know was able to do in his in his career he was really the assembler of great people towards a common mission and goal
(33:20) and that is what creates big companies is lots of people aligned in a specific direction to something that is meaningful which again if the point of your company is to make you money it's not that meaningful for a lot of people and so it has to be something bigger than you and that again is something that i had to learn once you do that you need to get out of their way really and so i have a friend of mine who owns a company and he's uh ceo of that company and the founder of the company you know made him ceo but he has become he's not really a ceo by the true sense that he's
(33:49) not actually executing and like leading uh the stuff because the founder is micromanaging which either means one of two things you either don't trust the person to to do their job or you're not good at hiring people that's it it's like either the person has the talent and you need to trust them or they don't have the talent which means you suck at hiring but either way we suck and so once you do have the right person we have to extend trust even if that person hasn't quote earned it yet because it's
(34:14) the only way that the machine runs and trust is typically reciprocal and sometimes you have to give it first and you will make more by giving it than by deciding to live a life without trust even if you get burned so that was been a lesson for me um from the last year one of the next ones was uh a players are the things that really grow business and like once you get stuck at like 30ish million and i've said this said this and i will say it again i was stuck there for for almost four years right and the
(34:39) thing that that got me out of that was realizing that i it was kept being me i kept trying to make me the center but it had to be everyone else it had to be other leaders it had to be other people driving the growth and setting up the incentive such that like they can win big time not just little time but big time and uh part of that i got from schwartzman's book in order to attract level 10 talent you have to have a level 10 opportunity and most people are not actually pursuing level 10 opportunities they're just trying to make some money and so if you want to attract the best people and work with the best people you
(35:07) have to be going after the big stuff the big goals right and it is just as hard to accomplish a big goal is a little goal and it takes just as long so you might as well go big that leaves me the next one which is like character and values must be present in order to attract caliber people right high caliber people and so i think one of the hardest parts of entrepreneurship is the leadership component because it's it's the most raw it's who you are right people have to buy into you because like you as you grow like
(35:31) get go up in the in the ranks like you're not going to be smarter than the people you hire like a lot of people that work at acorns.com are smarter than i am like i mean that generally that's not just like me paying lip service like they're very smart and they're smarter especially in their domains than i am the only way to attract those people is obviously to have a mission that that makes sense that they want to be a part of like i had to change i have to be better right this is adopted from mongers you know things of living an excellent life but it's living a life without envy it's
(35:58) living a life without resentment a living a life of discipline of not overspending means remaining charitable despite circumstance dealing with reliable people and doing what you say you're going to do and what you were supposed to do those are very easy to say very hard to do and i think that if we hold those as ideals we can just keep walking towards them without with knowing wholeheartedly that we will never achieve perfection but the process itself can be a perfect process even if you have an imperfect outcome and so in that way we can be joyful in our imperfection because we are following a
(36:28) perfect process so to me that's very cool but i think that if we view our leadership as a process of becoming rather than getting there then we will attract people who also want to walk in that path alongside us so that was from a talent perspective major lessons time horizons if you can extend them you will win sometimes we need to eat for an extended period of time and uh entrepreneurship is a battle of will not intellect and that was something that i learned especially in 2021 um and 2020.
(36:54) it is a battle of will not intellect i'm just going to say it again i don't know what you're doing right now it is a battle of will not intellect because since it is an infinite game which means that the point of the game is to keep the game going the point of the game is to keep playing not to win right because there is no winning you realize there is no winning so if the point of the game is to keep playing then it's about will it's about the will to endure it's about the will to continue and so if you can frame it that way then the game gets much easier because you realize there are no wins and losses as long as you're
(37:19) playing and if it is a game then what better to do in life than play next one is the importance of frame so this one is a really insane story and i'm gonna try and tell it as short as i can dean graziosi who's now become a very close personal friend uh he told me this story that just blew me away so if you don't know who he is he uh dean has is one of if not the best marketer out there he's unbelievable he's tony robbins right hand man he he's the main driver behind you know the business machine that that works there and he also has his own brand and they're all mass market and he had multiple brands before that motor
(37:48) millions and real estate and he's done a lot of stuff and he told me about this um ad that he ran and he was this perfect dad that he ran with larry king and he did this book interview and he was like it was the perfect interview i knew it was going to crush as an infomercial and then it bombed and he's like and he watched the whole thing and he knew it was going to be awesome he didn't get it so he flew larry king live out because he looked at all of his best winning infomercials and he looked at his and he thought that the first two
(38:12) sentences of the one hour long segment needed to be changed and so he flew him back out he did he redid the entire setup of larry king live covered all the expenses just so he could re-record the first two sentences and he re-recorded the first two sentences and then that infomercial did 100 million dollars plus in sales and to me the biggest lesson there from a marketing perspective but also from a psychology perspective was the frame is everything how you frame a conversation how you frame a situation how you frame a circumstance to yourself or others will massively
(38:47) change how they perceive the remaining information that they that gets transmitted to them and so when we're selling how we set the frame when we're trying to persuade our team how we set the frame when we want to make an offer how we set the frame when we want to make an ad how we set the frame are so important and if we look back on the best ads that you have those hooks you know ogilvy i think said once you've ridden your headline you've spent 80 cents out of your dollar in advertising and so realizing that that frame is so
(39:15) important has really made me rethink a lot of the things that we think about in our ads our copy headlines etc and how much more time needs to be allocated to that if eighty percent of your dollar is spent on the headline then you should spend eighty percent on that piece right on just perfecting that i'll tell you in the split test that we run things like that it's been bar none crazy to see how different just these tweaks are just on the headlines themselves and so the next one i want to cover is people are either helping you become the person you want to be or they are not
(39:46) there is no in between and so we have these people that we have in our lives and i think sometimes it was useful for me to kind of take inventory of like who are the people that when i see their name on my phone i get a pang of cortisol like i get a little bit of stress because i think they're taking something from me and when i actually looked through my my text messages it was 41 of texts were something that caused me stress and i was like well half i was like no wonder i hate my phone right and so piece by piece trying
(40:11) to remove uh people or just slow down the the communication cycles with people that i thought were draining me has been a very good process for me overall for thinking clarity and for accomplishing what i want to accomplish and so i don't know where you're at and the people but i think if you can take inventory of like and i just feel like the easiest litmus test is look at your phone look through your last week of texts and then think about which of these people are trying to take something from you and if you can slowly phase those people out and
(40:34) only have more of the people who who energize you i think life is just better right because if if you lose your phone and you're happier as a result of it it makes you really wonder why you have a phone success must be measured through multiple metrics so this was a huge one for 2021 for me is that and this is a quote from charlie munger is that someone is always doing better right someone's always doing better than you and so in in one aspect and so i think it's useful to have uh multiple metrics for measurements so you can have your body you can have your marriage you can
(41:00) have your finances you can have your business you can have your team you can have your kids you can have whatever like multiple metrics for success and in 2021 in my direct income not including the the sale numbers it was a medium year for me but for my marriage it was an amazing year and i'd say like we you know we three axed our marriage uh last year but it was a great great year for our marriage and so i think that and i think about 85 year old me looking back it's like yes good like multiple metrics
(41:24) for success and so i think measuring those things has been helpful for me when i think about a year of lessons and failures uh that was a good that was a plus in the plus column because i didn't used to do that the only goals i ever said were financial and so i think now i think i think more a little bit more holistically um next one is uh simple attainable goals create crazy growth one of the things is like now that we work with you know a lot of portfolio companies that are in internet businesses that are doing you know three million plus et cetera we set goals with them a lot right and a lot of times i see the goals that they
(41:55) want to set them just these massive goals and the thing is is that when we extend this horizon if you can get a 10 or 20 per quarter growth that's unbelievable and that adds up very very very very fast but everyone wants to double every 90 days and that's just not realistic and so they always fall short and so i have been a big proponent of how can we set a goal that's impossible for us to hit and then let's crush it halfway through the quarter and then reset the goal because i feel like it's better to just keep setting goals and keep crushing goals than to set goals and then miss them everyone has different psychologies
(42:24) around this but for me i like to make a commitment and stick with it and know that i'm going to hit it that has been very helpful and i think as i've gotten older in entrepreneurship i have set more and more reasonable goals and i think that as a result of that we actually grow more consistently and build a better company because we're not trying to do something crazy to hit a goal for no reason because it's arbitrary we set up the timeline so if we set the timeline way way way in the future and we know that we can just hit these basic benchmarks over a longer period of time we're going to build something huge and it's just thinking like that is what
(42:52) unlocks the huge growth potential that time provides next one contrarian investing so you must be willing to do the unpopular thing to be against the cycle right when everyone's worried right like when everyone's buying and buying inflated prices that's when you have to hold and just wait i look at uncle warren and he's got 25 percent of his uh of his assets in cash right now like that's a little interesting to me best investor of all time he's seen every cycle imaginable he understands stuff better than anyone he's probably also more connected and he's got 25 in
(43:22) cash interesting right very very interesting the next one is from an investing standpoint um layla and i have really committed just only investing in things we know which is why we work with internet businesses because it's the business as we know right and so sticking with that as our primary thesis so like there's something that you do know better than other people stick with that for us we limited real estate we still have you know a portfolio in real estate but it's limited due to the fact that like i don't have skill or experience in that and i can get outsized returns doing the thing that i'm good at right and an interesting
(43:51) thing is like if you get 10x on one tenth of your money you still have 100 irr right and so if you're worried about inflation for all of your money it's like if you get crazy returns on 20 of your money it still covers your whole nut right and so i think that's always making sure that you have the downside of mitigation you buy with a margin of safety right which is again uncle warren a couple things on time so i've realized that for me meetings on mondays work great so i just always just throw mondays up as like this is the day that i do for meetings that's that right i just accepted that as as a reality for
(44:23) me so people ask me about how my life looks that's how it looks mornings are sacred for me and so for me morning is until i lunch so basically 4 5 6 a.m until noon is my time to do stuff and i think that that has probably been one of the most integral habits that i have had in my life which is that i just get all my  done before lunch after lunch i do all my meetings and all my calls and all those things because my creative juice if i if i take meetings first thing my creative juice is spent and i can't work
(44:50) after but if i do creative stuff in the morning i still feel like i'm very effective on meetings after that for for whatever reason and that works for me some people might be opposite but i think having that dedicated time is really important some people work and then they love working from like whatever you know eight o'clock at night until two in the morning everyone's different but for me having that dedicated time has been super important next one i want all of my i like having space uh to do free things on my
(45:14) calendar and so when i have everything every minute booked um and this has changed over time for me and maybe it'll change in the future but i get i stress out and i feel like i'm less productive and so having free time to think and create ultimately produces outsized returns it's just not as reliable or at least rather as it is more volatile in nature so i might have a free day and not get anything done and then i might have a free day and crush it but i know that having free days makes me more than never having free days hopefully that makes sense next one is that writing next books so i think a lot
(45:44) of people underestimate how much time it takes to make something that's excellent and the difference between good and great is vast and so uh when we're making products i share this story because i think it will resonate with someone like writing this book uh took me a really long time right and that's why i think it ended up being uh pretty decent because we spent so many times rewriting it like i rewrote this book four times end to end the leads book i've now i'm on my sixth version and it's still not done yet because it's it's honestly a more complicated topic and it just takes
(46:13) it just takes work sometimes the work just needs doing for it to be excellent and so that is just a reminder more than it is a lesson and it's for myself included um because i get impatient i want to send you guys the next book i want to publish it but like it's just not there and i'm also doing all the other stuff and so it will happen when it happens and i promise that if it you know has my name on it and i'm saying it's great then it is my best effort to be exceptional and worthy of your time next one is uh supply and demand i have i feel like every few years i get like a
(46:41) new level of depth on my on my understanding my perceived understanding of those two forces but man supply and demand drive price just so much i just and what's crazy is that you have you can influence demand by being persuasive right in that you can channel more of it towards you it's even easier to influence supply uh and so it's it's so it's so interesting to put limits on things and again it's very counter-human right we think if we limit things we will make less money but a lot of times when we limit things we make more money
(47:12) which is why a limited swag drop makes more money than always have the t-shirt on your website and so creating and imposing limits creates clarity of thinking it creates clear value and you actually end up getting more people who want it because it is scarce and so i am continually re-re-taught i re-learn this lesson in different in different ways and it's been very valuable and so like for us you know at acquisition.
(47:36) com we're taking on internet businesses it's like we have a lot of people who who reach out and we just the reason that we have such high returns with the companies and they grow so well is because we have no need to take anyone i don't we don't need to do any of it and so we just get to pick the ones that we want to do for a long time because we want to do it and because we think we can absolutely kill it and i think that having that i don't like there's no need there's no scarce there's no there's no vacuum that needs to get filled there's no short-term arbitrary goal that we're
(48:05) trying to hit it's just for the love of the game and as a result of the long-time horizon you can have more scarcity because there is no arbitrary goal that we need to hit and in so doing you create better outcomes which is again so counter-intuitive that it drives me nuts but it's also like the one of the beautiful things with life that i feel like i'm learning right now and so anyways i to me that's like a very beautiful contrast that i figured i'd share with you just the idea that the perceived supply and demand are really the only factors that influence price and we can control both of those things
(48:36) and especially how few things we want to sell if it comes to our time our attention etc and a lot of us we better serve just limiting the amount of people and actively saying i'm only doing this once that cap is met being done it's amazing how good it feels to say like i have hit like i we are we are where we need to be that is all we don't there is no need for more we have enough right and then when you so choose to you have built up sufficient demand that when you open up the door the slots fill back up and you can close it again right and it's much better to
(49:05) always know where your next meal is coming from i think emotionally than to never know and always feel like you are wanting and craving more and so it's been an interesting process uh to kind of like walk through that and i think a lot of service-based businesses would be very well served properly utilizing scarcity to better serve their customers to increase their margins and ultimately provide a better experience overall because they're not doing it because they have some arbitrary goal that they just like set and they're like i want to hit a million a month for no reason
(49:29) right why why right if you can answer that question i guarantee you'll hit it last one last last major lesson topic for me was uh leverage the amount we make amount of money we make is directly proportionally amount of leverage that we are able to employ you know naval has his his his four that he talks about i renamed them as cs so i could remember it but you've got collaboration which is employing other people you've got capital which is using other people's money you've got code which is using software and you've got content or media right which is uh all
(50:04) of these things uh especially the top two you can replicate without cost right like if two people use a software 100 people use the software there's very little additional cost if one person watches this video or a thousand people watch this video there's no added cost to me for capital if i can use other people's money right then i can grow something faster if i can use other people's time when it comes to labor then i can do more right and so i think understanding how to use all four of those things is one of the things that unlocks true wealth and so i
(50:33) would encourage you and this has been a process that i've taken i've really geeked out on but look at the wealthiest people in the world and look at the people around you who are succeeding who are growing quickly and look at which of those four c's if one two three four or all of them they are using to grow their businesses and so now when i look at opportunity it's how can i employ the most leverage and the opportunity because then all leverage does is give you higher output per unit of effort or time that's all it
(51:02) is if we only have limited time the extent to which we can multiply that time is an extent to which we're employing leverage which is the multiplier and so these are all multipliers in and of themselves if you look at facebook they used they have labor there's lots of employees who are working there there's capital they use other people's money to grow the business there's code which is the software base that the whole thing is built on and they sell media it's all four right all four things are created and that's why the thing is the empire that it is you can see how people are
(51:30) employing these things together you look at uh grant and some of you guys for some reason like poopoo the fact that like i've even talked to grant which is beyond silly to me whenever someone's doing better than you at anything there's something we can learn from them right and so like i'm okay i'm gonna i'm gonna talk to your heart for a second it is your ego that is fragile that makes you not want to learn from someone else who's doing better than you in some way because you feel like it makes you suck
(51:59) and you want to give an excuse for why someone else has achieved more than you in that way well he doesn't have the ethics that i have well he has better genetics well blah blah he was born better looking whatever it is right for the wife right whatever it is it doesn't serve you and i say this as somebody who used to do that a lot and so i realized that i was not getting any better by giving up all my excuses for why i wasn't achieving what someone else was achieving and so the biggest goal was to reframe my envy into curiosity which is how are they doing
(52:28) that and how am i not doing as well as them if i claim to be all these things then the reality should match that and it's not and so i will break down why i think um i think grant's going to multiply by a lot like a lot a lot i'll tell you why so one he knows how to he knows how to galvanize people towards a cause so he knows how to employ and and and have people aligned so that's he's got collaboration the next level is he's got capital he's raising tons and tons and tons of money to to buy stuff and he's
(52:58) got tons and tons of content and uh the next move that i think he's going to make is um is around starting a bank and i think it'll be one of the most brilliant moves that he makes because what's even easier than getting someone to invest just get someone to save and what'll be cool is that what is going to happen is he's going to have so many deposits into cardone bank that he can then use that money to go to the fed and he can lever bank rates of leverage um and then buy way more stuff to get returns on that because people are still
(53:25) too chicken to make investments for themselves so they're just going to bank and he'll give them a better return on their money than the banks are and he'll be able to suck so much cash from the universe of his audience and that he will get so much leverage on the things that he's going to buy i think it's going to be a really really cool thing to say and so anyways i think they're in that way we can learn of him now does he have any does he have any code no he's got three other four maybe he'll be able to embed that stuff in later maybe he won't
(53:49) i don't know and so the thing is just like you don't need to have all of them but the more of them you have the more multiplicative the effect is on the ultimate amount of money that you make and when someone goes from you know zero to billionaire in a decade i think we can all learn something from it i certainly am trying to analyze everything that someone is doing much better than i am um is doing right especially with the same period i'm like well i i was alive 10 years ago and he was live 10 years ago and he became a billionaire in that
(54:13) time and i did not become a billionaire therefore he's better at this game than i am right now right and so um i just think it's really valuable to look at that way the last piece is uh seasons of waiting waiting and in action are active decisions charlie martin talks about this when it comes to investing he's like not selling is an active decision all you have to do is look at the markets because people cannot hold themselves back it's not that we are doing nothing we are doing nothing get the difference we're not doing nothing we're doing
(54:43) nothing and that was the active decision we chose to make and so sometimes we just need to wait and that was something that i feel like i learned last year as well was that you know you can't you can't uh you can't have you can have you can't get nine women pregnant for a month to have a baby right like some things take time i think an acceptance of a different view on time has been something that shaped my life for the better and i can tell you the people unequivocally that make the most money that i know all speak in the longest time horizons and the people who make the least amount of money
(55:15) unequivocally talking the shortest time horizons the people who talk about today tomorrow next week this month make less money than the people we're talking about five years from now without fail and so if that's all you can think about which is what are we making this month what are making this week what are we making today right you need to extend your time horizon because when you do that you think smart because you think long and when you think long you make games where if you wait you win and so
(55:40) mosi nation those are the lessons and failures from 2021 those are things that i learned that were very valuable to me i made another video about just lessons that i learned from the sale which i think i might have made a little bit too technical and i have another video that i made uh about how to sell a business uh that was very in-depth as well in terms of the actual process of selling because i get lots of questions around that and so um check out those videos if you did and as always love you all and i'll see you guys next video keeping awesome bye

Why "Following Your Dreams" is Keeping You Poor - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6uhd-FiCggg

Transcript:
(00:00) Following your passion keeps people poor, or at least poorer than they ought to be. And maybe you feel lost right now. I get it. I've been there. I was dead broke in my early 20s and I read all the self-help books I could get my hands on. And a lot of them said follow your passion. And ironically, that didn't help me.
(00:17) Then I started changing what I did and my life changed as a result. So problem number one with follow your passion, it gets cause and effect backwards. So often we become passionate about things after we get good at them, not before. You will hear people say, "Follow your passion." You'll hear really smart people, very successful people say that.
(00:33) And think about why they might say that. They're like, "Well, let me look at myself. I'm passionate about what I do, so just do what I do. Be passionate." But the thing is is it's just like saying, "Hey, if you want to be rich, fly private, or if you want to be tall, go play basketball." It doesn't work that way. You get rich and then as a result of being rich, you can fly private.
(00:52) It's not that flying private is the reason that you're rich, right? So you will do the work to become passionate. Not that being passion is necessarily the thing. Now here's the thing. Some people are like, well, some people just naturally have a passion. No, they found the thing earlier. They had their chance experience when they were in their early toddler years or they're five, six, seven.
(01:13) They start painting and it's like, oh god. So they follow the same process. They had some sort of chance encounter. They start doing a little bit of deliberate practice. All of a sudden they realize there's value in their skill. Their parents, their friends are like, oh, you're good at drawing. Oh, you must really like this. And then boom, all of a sudden deeper passion emerges.
(01:28) They start identifying as it and then boom, competence, skill, and then passion. And so I say this to say that some of you, myself included, like never really had some thing that just magically occurred. Uh you have to start stuff that you're not necessarily as good at and have broader exposure to the allowed chance to take root.
(01:45) Number two, it's too vague and assumes everyone has a clear passion. And many people have no idea, right? So, it's hard to say that you like X more than Y. You might like both, right? And so, it's very hard to quantify. It makes it hard to decide. And so, how good you are at something is a little bit easier to make an AB decision on, right? So, if I said, you know, do you like pizza more than you like tacos? You might be like, I don't know.
(02:08) Like, I kind of like both of them, right? But if I said, are you better at English than you are at math? It's probably easier for you to make a call there, right? And so preferences versus skills are easier to determine a decision path which then gives you clarity on what next steps to take. So even examples. So Bill Gates tried a bunch of different things.
(02:26) So he tried law, he tried mathematics, he tried programming before he found his direction and he wasn't following a clear passion, but he was exploring his abilities and opportunities. And I'll give you a personal example. Back in the day before I started business, I was like, well, I kind of like fro yo. And I learned a little bit about that.
(02:40) I was like, I like fitness and I like test prep. And so I kind of had these different skill sets and these different domains, but I was only able to have clarity once I started and then took action on it because then the feedback loop begins. And so the objective of developing passion is to get a feedback loop started.
(02:57) So three, liking something doesn't make you good at it. All right? So think about it like this. Being passionate doesn't even guarantee that you have the skills for it. And sometimes it's better to have a career and enjoy your passions in your free time. My dad used to tell me, "Well, if I did what I was passionate about, I'd be a bartender at a ski slope.
(03:13) " And I mean, he used to say it in Jess, but like the point rang clear to me. He was like, "Listen, there's things that you do to provide for your family. There's things you do to provide for yourself, build a future, have security, and there's things that you do uh with your free time." Now, some people are like, "Those things can be one and the same.
(03:26) " But I'll tell you what, my dad loves what he does. And I'll tell you that he didn't start it because he loved it. He started because he wanted to just be a productive member of society. Maybe it's a little bit that immigrant in me, but like you know the rest of the world isn't so comfortable that they're sitting in sunshine and rainbows.
(03:40) But here's the crazy part. Many of them are more fulfilled than we are because they don't see anything wrong with doing the work. Doing the work is seen as a very like it's seen as a beautiful responsibility. Seen as a good thing. Guy provides for his family. Nothing wrong with that. So I'll give you a little a little example here.
(03:55) So Warren Buffett follows a philosophy that he calls the circle of competence. All right? Which is focusing not on what excites you but on what you understand best. and his passion follows his competence, not the other way around. So, for example, me personally, all the gym owners I know love fitness, but many of them were very broke.
(04:14) And so, they said, hey, I should start a business around fitness because I'm passionate about it. And then made no money because they had to realize, oh, wait, I don't know anything about business. And so, it's like being understanding fitness is like 5% of the fitness business. It's just kind of like, oh, I like cooking.
(04:27) I should start a restaurant. It's like, well, it's about 5%. And what's crazy is the thing that you're actually passionate about, cooking or doing fitness, has almost nothing to do with monetizing that skill. Real. So here's the fourth reason I think it's bad advice. Follow your passion skips the hard work part.
(04:42) So getting really good at something means practicing the boring or the hard parts too, right? So for example, I actually really like playing ping pong, something that I enjoy. So I decided I was like, "Oh, I'm going to look into what it would take to get better at ping pong because I do like it and I play it a lot when I can.
(04:56) " And I started watching what some of the teams do and they're like, "All right, 500 forehands, 500 backhands in a row." And I was like, "Oh, yeah. I don't want to do this." And so I may be passionate about it, but I don't want to do the work that is required to go from passionate to like world class or state level or whatever, right? All of the research on deliberate practice shows that it's not an enjoyable process.
(05:20) I want to say this again. all the research on deliberate practice which is required for competence and competence is certainly required for making money in whatever career you want is that it is not an enjoyable process. This is what the research showed. All right, I was actually kind of blown away by that.
(05:34) And so when you're repeating the same sales script over and over again, it's not that fun. All right, it's very tedious. Or you do the same basketball shot over and over again, right? Or you know, you do the same presentation, the same speech, you do it over and over and over again. So it's not novel.
(05:48) It's just focused on tiny iterations on feedback loops. is just sanding off the edges over and over and over again. And once all of the first level of roughness uh is faded off, you take a a lower grade uh sandpaper and then all of a sudden you do it another level of smoothness. Like you just you approach it in levels of feedback.
(06:06) I mean, one of my favorite quotes from myself is the real work begins when the excitement to work ends. A lot of skill development is like running a marathon where you have a couple people might cheer you on in the beginning for making a decision to start and then for 26.1 miles basically no one cares.
(06:24) You're running and you're like, "Wow, this is really long." And then you're like, "Oh my god, I have to do four more of these 15s, right?" And you're like, "Holy God, this is or five more of these 1/5s is tough." And then at the very end, right as you're about to accomplish, people just see you sprint the last bit and they're like, "Oh, congratulations.
(06:39) " But you're like, "It's the mundane middle. You have to master the middle. That's where all the That's where all the gains come in. So, I'll share a rule that has worked very well for me for developing skills. And so, this is the $100 million leads book. Step four of Outbound, I talked about this, which is reach out to them 100 per day, right? And so, I call this the rule of 100.
(06:58) I talk about it at length a little further in the book, but like when I did my book launch, actually for this book two years ago, I practiced the presentation that I did 90 times before I actually did it live. Right? Now, the rule of 100 is about doing a h 100red per day, right? So, it's hard for me to do the entire preparation 100 times a day because there's literally not that much that many hours.
(07:16) But, I did it three full times per day. It was a 90-minute presentation. So, about four and a half hours of deliberate practice per day. And I would watch the recording and then I would tweak the presentation where I stumbled or I felt like I needed a better visual, whatever. And I did that every single day.
(07:30) And so, the idea is that it just requires significantly more work. And it's also not going to be fun. And the more practice you have at practicing, the better you get at it. Because I know that practice precedes excellence. And so the more times you start practicing and realizing that that practice leads to winning, you start to get excited to practice, not for that practice itself, but because what practice means to you because you know what comes after practice, which is winning.
(07:58) Here's the fifth reason that I think following your passion is terrible advice. It also sets false expectations. So, it makes you feel like work should always be fun and exciting and it isn't. An early mentor of mine told me and I will never forget this. He said, "Never try to make money out of something you love.
(08:13) " He said, "Because then you'll just ruin it and turn it into work." And it was so interesting because he was a very successful guy. And of course, you're going to have people on both sides of this. And again, I I want to be clear. I think that you want to do things you enjoy. I just think that it takes time of not enjoying it to get to the part where you enjoy it because it takes time to get good.
(08:32) And so for anybody who's going to like try and blow me up on this, by all means do it. We're all going to die and no one's going to remember us. But like the point is you have to develop passion rather than follow it. You have to create it. And so I'll give you a different example. Many Hollywood actors realize that it sucks and that many acting careers involve more waiting, rejection, and business administration than actually creative fulfillment.
(08:58) And so Jeff Bezos talks about this where he says everything is overhead. And so there's like you might have you basically have like maybe 10% or 20% or 30% of your day. Like if you have 30% of your day that you love. I feel like you're winning at life, right? Because the other 70% is stuff that is required in order to get that 30%.
(09:14) Because the thing is is let's look at the alternative. You could just do nothing, right? And I think that if you do nothing or you hate everything you do that there's probably a middle path. And I'll also say something that I think most people will disagree with, but I'll just shoot I'm going to shoot my shot.
(09:28) I think that the way that you approach the work you do can fundamentally change the work itself. And so there's this great um I think it's a parable or analogy, maybe it's a story. Um but basically of this man who uh basically swept floors for like 35 years and he just did an amazing job.
(09:48) It's a Japanese uh story and the way that he approached this and was like how are you like there's no way that this is fun or interesting. And he ends up saying like, I imagine that they're paying me a million dollars every single day to sweep the floors. And so I think, how would I sweep them if they paid me a million dollars every day to sweep? And so it changed his entire perception of how to approach the work.
(10:13) And if the work that you do, um, I saw this this this little post that went viral the other day of a waiter that had a tip that said, "Do better," right? So instead of having money there, it said basically $0. And the person said do better. And he said, "Normally, you know, I could, you know, take this and be like really offended or say these people sucked.
(10:32) " But he decided to take it to heart. And so the next day he showed up to work and was like, "I'm just going to try and be the best." He's like, "I'm going to try and remember everyone's names. I'm going to try and smile, be charismatic." He's like, "And the craziest thing happened. All of a sudden people were telling me I was so nice and they started giving me bigger tips and they started talking to me about other opportunities.
(10:50) " And the thing is is that he was still doing the same job but he was the way he approached it was different. And so like would you say that you're was he did he become passionate about his work or he did he just decide to see the larger picture that the work we do works on us more than we work on it? And so that leads me naturally to the sixth reason that I think follow your passion is terrible advice.
(11:15) Um it also just ignores money realities. Right? Just because you love something doesn't mean you can make enough money doing it. So just look at American Idol triyouts, right? Ain't nobody trying to see them sing, right? Even though those people love it. And so I remember for me early in my career, I wasn't driven really by a specific passion.
(11:31) I just didn't really want to be broke anymore. Like as terrible as this sounds, like people used to ask me like, "What's the mission of Gym Launch?" The mission of Gym Launch when I started Gym Launch was Alex not being broke. That was the mission of Gym Launch. Now here's the thing. As I developed the business, it did become to take an industry from its knees to its feet.
(11:50) But at the moment when I started gym lunch, I just lost everything for the second time. And I was like, I I am not doing this again. I was like, this has to work, right? And so I I say this that like a lot of people have a lot of romanticism, but it's just not based in reality. And people doctor their memories.
(12:09) They look back and it feels different than when you're going through it. And I'll give you a simple example of this. when you look back on some of the hardest things you've gone through, you probably have a sense of pride for having gotten through them, but you're proud in retrospect. And so if someone says, "Hey, you know what's it like?" It's like, "Oh, you know what? You got to you just got to enjoy the moment.
(12:26) You got to revel in it." It's like you're not reing in it. It sucks. But you keep going. You persist because of what you know it's building inside of you, the skill sets so that you can persevere at a higher level. So I'll give you I'll give you a business example. All right? So there's a very harsh reality of supply and demand.
(12:45) All right? And so if your passion is something that a lot of people like to do, there's probably a lot of people wanting to do it. And so that means there's a lot of supply. And so it's going to be super super competitive. Think acting, think singing, think painting. And so it might not be the most realistic path for making money.
(13:03) And like one of my early mentors said, it's like, well, what stops you from just painting when you want to paint and then making money when you want to make money. Seventh reason I think that follow your advice is follow your advice. Follow your advice is bad advice is bad passion. Follow your passion is bad advice.
(13:16) All right is that it misses often more important life things. All right. So good work needs decent pay, good co-workers, good recognition, security and purpose. All right? And so the environment you work in will absolutely affect how much you like it and how long you can endure it. All right? So this is a a quote from my good friend Shiron Servata.
(13:38) Um, in my 20s I thought it was about the destination. In my 30s I thought it was about the journey. And in my 40s I realized it's about the company. And I thought that was so profound. It's like in the beginning you're just you're always like, "How do I get there? How do I get there? How do I get there?" And then little later you're like, you know what? It's about enjoying the process.
(13:55) But then later you're like, well, how do I enjoy the process? Well, if I've got the people I like around me, it makes almost any process enjoyable. And so there's other components that factor into the overall soup of what you want to do in your life and what you actually spend your time on.
(14:11) And so I'll give you two examples. So imagine uh you've got one career where you do what you like, but it's terrible work environments. You hate all the people. You actually don't like the the the thing you're producing, but you like the work that you do, but not what the outcome is. Right? So it's removing purpose.
(14:28) Um and it doesn't allow you to do some of the other things that you enjoy. Well, that would probably be pretty painful. On the flip side, if you had a job where you're like, "Okay, I don't like this component of my job, but I like literally everything else." Well, you'd probably have a more filling life that way. Now, I will zoom out for a moment if we want to break the world for a second.
(14:47) You don't need to have a fulfilling life. Who made that demand of the universe? Anyways, uh so I'll give you some people like, well, life should be life should be fulfilling. I should it life should make me happy, right? You just demand of the universe. And by doing that, by the way, you create space between you and the outcome, which means you'll never achieve it.
(15:10) Anyways, so eighth reason why follow your passion is terrible advice is that it doesn't allow flexibility and a changing world. This is a big one. All right? And a changing you. So think about like this. What did you like when you were 12? probably different things than you like when you're 22, which I can promise you is different than the things that you like at 32 and probably different than things that you like at 52.
(15:31) And so the thing is is that the world cares also about different things 20 years later. And so you are going to change and the world is going to change about what you like and about what it likes. And so if you say follow your passion, what if you change or the world change as that's happening? And so being obsessed with your one thing doesn't give you the flexibility to evolve.
(15:54) And so for example, what if you were really passionate about making MySpace pages that was something you're really passionate about. Well, the world moved on. And so like either you're going to move on or the world moves on. And if you always obsess about that one thing, then it's like that might change. And if you if you burn all these boats around this one passion, it assumes that it will be there forever.
(16:10) And that's not reality. And here's the ninth reason that I think follow your passion is terrible advice. It's self-focused rather than others focused. And there's tons of research that says that people who focus on others are the happiest if that's your goal. You might not want to be the happiest. So fine. And so we tend to look back and are proud of the hard things that we overcame, especially in service of other people or a larger mission.
(16:35) So for me, I would make real business education accessible for everyone. And the thing is is that I don't always want to record content. I don't always want to think about what we're going to talk about today or what, you know, what we're going to put out. But the the service of that mission is very valuable for me. And there's a different body of research.
(16:50) I can't tell you where it is. So you can choose to believe it or not. But that people can actually endure a significantly larger amount of pain for other people. So hear me out. So if if if you got hooked up to an electric shock machine and they said, "Cool, we're just going to turn this up and just tell us when to stop.
(17:06) " People stop. But if you tell the person that their loved one is in the other room and that every shock that you take, they don't have to take, people's tolerance for pain goes up like tenfold. And so to me, I see that as an allegory for how we can choose to live our lives. So that person who's experiencing the pain for let's say their loved one, their wife, their spouse, their daughter, their their their son, do you think that in that moment when they're when they feel like they're shielding the storm from the people they love that they don't
(17:33) feel like they have purpose, but objectively they're suffering? See how there's layers to this? And so the idea is I think that saying follow your passion is very self-interested. It actually doesn't allow you to plug into a much stronger motivation or fuel. And so I would prefer follow your purpose. It's called the martyrdom effect.
(17:54) But basically you can handle way more pain in the service of others which is wild. But the thing is is if you're like man I'm struggling to get motivated. It's because it's you're trying to get motivated for you rather than get motivated for other people. And I know that sounds a little fufu but at the end of the day like the research is the research right? Like we are built this way. We're social creatures.
(18:11) And it would make sense that people get applauded for sheltering and protecting and serving the community. And I think that that's so woven into our culture or most cultures that we're willing to do so much for it. I can tell you right now, I absolutely can take more pain for Leila than I can for it and just replace Ila with whatever that thing is that you love.
(18:32) And so I want to I want to tell you this story cuz I think it's uh it's a parable that really resonates deeply with me and it's similar to that Japanese man who who sweeps the floors, which is a traveler came upon three stone cutters working at a quarry. And so he asks them what they were doing. The first stone cutter replies, "I'm cutting stone. I'm exhausted.
(18:52) It's backbreaking work. I'm miserable." This He goes to the second stone cutter. He says, "You know, what are you doing here?" He says, "Uh, I'm earning a living to support my family." And, you know, cool. He goes to the third stone cutter and he says, "What are you doing?" The third stone cutter smiles and he says, "I'm building a cathedral that's going to inspire people for generations that my grandchildren and their grandchildren are going to be able to go to and worship our Lord.
(19:18) " And the thing is is that all three stone cutters, all three men are doing the same work fundamentally having an entirely different experience of what that work means to them. And so that same work that you do that right now might feel terrible can be a job. That work can be a career or that work can be a calling simply depending on your own perspective.
(19:42) And so maybe just do what the world wants that you're good at it and then allow yourself the time to become passionate about it along the way as you get better. And so passion happens as a consequence, not a requirement. So if you're like that's all well and good, Alex, but what do I do? Well, big operationalization fan. And so what do you do instead of following your passion? So here's a practical actionoriented framework that will invert that advice into positive steps that anyone can take.
(20:06) Number one, start with curiosity, not passion. So begin by exploring things that pique your interest, even mildly. All right? Just like Duckworth research showed, most successful people didn't start with a burning passion. They began with just simple curiosity that they were willing to investigate.
(20:20) They were willing to follow up. A different way of saying that is just something that you might be interested in, right? The second is embrace the learning process. So commit to developing the skills and competence first. Get good first. Recognize that mastery precedes passion. Getting good precedes enjoying it, not the other way around.
(20:39) And set skillspecific building goals rather than kind of waiting for motivation to strike because I promise you, you're going to wait for a long time. Number three, value your existing abilities. So assess what you're already good at and then consider building from there. Like Warren Buffett says, look at the circle of competence, right? Focus on the areas of natural advantages.
(20:57) Some things you naturally have done more early on in your life. Just do more of those things. Four, commit to the deliberate process. Burn the boats. And I define commitment as the elimination of alternatives. Meaning accept that meaningful progress requires hard work and fundamentals might not feel exciting, right? Like Olympic athletes do so many repetitive drills.
(21:15) Like uh Phelps used to talk about just eight hours of swimming. Can you imagine that? Just lap after lap after lap after lap after lap after lap. It's just so many repetitions. And just understand that excellence requires practice and the boring parts are included. Five, set realistic expectations. So recognize that all work involves tedious aspects, stuff that sucks, right? So instead of expecting constant enjoyment, aim for overall satisfaction and meaning.
(21:40) And just remember that even dream jobs like Baso said have administrative tasks challenges. They have overhead, right? They have stuff that sucks. It's just part of life. Six, take the reality of money seriously, right? Like money will not bring you happiness, but it can help you avoid pain. Now, I also have a little bit of a a nuggie on this, which is that people do get happier up to a certain amount of money and then it stops. Alex's theory on this.
(22:04) Spending money is a skill. Most people can only learn how to spend money up to here and then they don't learn how to spend it effectively. I believe that money can continue to make you happier as you develop the skill of spending in a way that gets you better returns on in on intangible returns rather than tangible returns.
(22:23) So if you have the if you have to pick between two different things, follow the path that might have higher income earning. If you're about even on both, follow the money. Next, prioritize other environmental factors. All right? So if you want to change your life, change your environment. I've said this a hundred times, but if you want, if you're like, I'm really getting I'm struggling to do to do this, you know, to find this passion, go to a place where other people are passionate about it.
(22:44) All right? That environment in of itself will create multiple feedback loops because all we're really looking for here, guys, like just be very real is you just want to find a feedback loop. That's all we're looking for. You just find want to find a place where you can do something and get someone that says that sucked. That was terrible. This is what you need to do better or different.
(23:00) And so finding a place where you have supportive colleagues or you've got supportive people who are all kind of in pursuit of the same thing, all trying to get better. That's the the like it will change your life. Next, allow your passions to evolve. So stay open to developing new interests throughout your life. You don't have to be stuck with one thing.
(23:15) And if you change your mind, that's okay, right? Your 40-year-old self will likely have different passions than your 20-year-old self. They probably will find different people interesting at 40 as you do as 20, right? And the world will also change, too. So having that flexibility is important.
(23:28) And so committing to this one passion forever, it's it's it's too heavy of a decision, I think. And so if you come into it saying this might change will allow you to take the first step because it's not this has to be the perfect pick. I have to this has to be the one thing forever. It's like it's too big, right? Just shrink it down like all right well I'm kind of interested in this for now.
(23:49) So start, right? And then finally connect your work to serving others. And I think this is arguably one of the biggest ones just because there's so much research that supports it is that you just want to find ways on how your work benefits other people. You look at think about the stone cutters, right? All three guys are doing the same work.
(24:03) One of them feels like so incredibly passionate about this because it's helping the world. It's helping his family out and he's getting paid while he does it. Like and the crazy part is that all of them are doing the same work. And so I think the easiest way to become passionate about what you do is to choose to become passionate about what you do and find a reason that's larger than yourself to pursue it.
(24:24) And that passion and your ability to withstand the pain because the pain now has purpose behind it rather than it being meaningless. And if you want to see a real person taking their passion and then turning it into uh you know a monetized business, I did this full breakdown of a girl who's really into fashion and stylist stuff.
(24:41) Don't worry, you don't have to be into that.

(00:00) Business is hard, but you can make it easy if you have the right cheat codes. So, it's something called a money model, and they are responsible for the vast majority of my material success, and I'm launching it live August 16th. So, goal, that sounds like a pretty big promise. Let me tell you a little bit more about the book overall.
(00:18) So, what is a money model? So, a money model is a series of offers deliberately structured to generate the most upfront cash. That's this guy. Get the most leads together, and get the highest lifetime value, which you generate by getting people to buy again and again and again. And we purposely also accelerate this cash flow so that we can get them to buy in less time.
(00:37) And by doing that, we can outspend our competition and futureproof the business. Because the one thing that I can absolutely guarantee that will not change in the history of mankind is that the cost of advertising will only go one way, which is up. How is it that some businesses can be 100 plus years old and other businesses struggle in their first year despite the ones that are brand new starting in this digital age? Whereas these ancient businesses are still able to out compete. The difference is a money model. That's how you see companies like JP Morgan. That's how you see companies like Northwestern Mutual.
(01:03) Some of these companies that are 100 plus years old, GE, that have existed and been able to continue to exist, not because they're hopping on some influencer trend or because they have the latest trending hashtag or they've got meme music in the background, but because they have a stronger money model.
(01:20) So, money models are sequences that when combined are so profitable, they're responsible for the vast majority of my material success. Like, nothing else comes close. And to put this in context, I have not talked about the concepts in this book publicly. And I started writing this in 2021 and I have saved every single concept from this book just for now and for the live launch. So let me put this in context.
(01:37) Most businesses have it completely backwards, right? They spend money to get customers and then they hope to make it back over time. That's what makes business so hard. That's playing on hard mode. Money models is flipping that. You make more money getting a customer than it costs you to get them within the first 30 days. That's the cheat code.
(01:53) So, let me give you an example what this looks like in action. When I started my gym, you know, obviously things started slowly, but then I started running ads and things started improving. Now, that worked for a minute until my ads became too expensive. The algorithm changed overnight, which happens over and over again throughout, you know, time.
(02:12) And all of a sudden, my cost of getting a customer went from like $100 to like $500. And I'm using these as placeholders, but just say they went from I could afford it to not afford it. You can do the math here. If I charge a $99 a month membership, which I did at the time, and I'm spending $500 to get them, I'm literally paying $400 out of pocket for the privilege of having a customer that I hope will someday make me money later.
(02:29) Now, if that person stays for, call it 10 months, then I pay 500 to make a,000. Kind of tough because I still have other costs that I have to make out of that 500, but like maybe tenable, but not realistically tenable because that means that I have to be negative for 5 months before I make my first dollar profit, which means I have to front money that I might not have, which is the situation that most business owners find themselves in.
(02:45) Option one is you either just burn through your savings and pray. Option two is you take on debt and then just give away, you know, your future essentially. Or number three is that you take on cash from investors. You raise money, then you sell, you know, sell your equity, which you may or may not want to do, or you just eventually go broke and close the doors, right? This is kind of what I was facing at this moment. I was flying home for the holidays. This is before I stopped flying home for the holidays. And I was at the airport and a guy that I knew in
(03:11) college came up to me. He was like, "Oh, you know, you know, how things going?" I was like, "Oh, I started a business." He's like, "Oh, well, I have two locations." I was like, "So, what's the business?" And he was like, "Oh, I have a supplement store.
(03:22) " I was like, "Okay, how much you making out of the stores?" And he said, "I'm making 80 grand and 130 grand a month between, you know, in each one." And mind you, again, I didn't ask him for bank statements, but that's what he said. And I was like, "Holy, like 80 grand a month." And I was like, "If he can do that just selling supplements," I was like, "And he doesn't have members." I was like, "I've got members at my gym.
(03:41) I'm sure I could get at least a quarter of that if I tried." I then, you know, bought a bunch of supplements. I couldn't figure out how to how to get them to to actually buy, but eventually I was able to figure out how to get them to buy. Once I did, that took my person walking in the door and then I was able to get them to buy a few hundred in supplements in the first 48 hours.
(04:00) And then after that point, all of a sudden, I could afford to run ads again. That very small change of just saying, "Oh, I'm just going to sell them supplements after they come to my gym." That change fundamentally changed the economics of my business. It changed my money model and as a result I was able to now spend more than my competitors who were at the at that time only spending enough to just get enough leads.
(04:24) They burn through their marketing budget and then they had to wait till the next month to reload up on customers. And this is what allowed me to continue to expand and expand until the point that I open up new locations over and over again because it made me money to open locations which makes absolutely no sense. But if you have a money model, if you have a way of getting customers to pay you more than it costs to get them upfront, then figuratively you unlock your ability to get more customers. Now, you're going to have other constraints in the business.
(04:48) I had four walls. I had to get trainers. I had other operational issues. But getting customers and more succinctly the cash required to get more customers no longer was a constraint. Because if every customer comes preloaded within them, the cost of getting them, the cost of delivering for them, and the cost of getting the next customer, plus the cost of delivering for the next customer, when you have all four of those preloaded in one in gross profit, you can spend as much as you want. The only thing worse than lighting fake money on fire is lighting real money on fire, which business owners do every single
(05:18) day when they try to get customers and the cost of getting customers cost them more than the customers make them. And fundamentally, if you do that for long enough, you go out of business. And so, it is the biggest threat to businesses every single day. But there is a better way, and the way you do that is with a money model.
(05:34) Because money models show you how to get more customers to spend more money in less time over and over again. And I'm going to be showing you how to do this live at my money models launch. So, click register and I'll see you there. The next question is like, well, so how does this actually work mechanically to get customers? In the book, after I looked at all of the different businesses that I've had over my career, I realized that I could basically bucket deliberate sequence of offers into four buckets that kind of meet four different objectives. And when you combine all four, you maximize likelihood that you generate the most cash flow from the
(05:59) most customers in the shortest period of time. So number one is you have attraction offers. So these are offers that maximize the likelihood of conversion. So think about getting the most leads to buy something. And these ones tend to often have what I would consider upfront cash components. So things that pull cash flow forward.
(06:16) The next is upsells, which is okay, now that we've maximized the number of customers that are walking the door, how can we maximize the gross profit per customer? So this is the getting them to spend more money part. After that, we have the downell component. We have customers who come in and aren't willing to pay for the most expensive thing, but they may be willing to buy something. And so by doing that, we turn nos into yeses.
(06:33) Now, the key part is that downells are very risky if you don't know how to do them properly. If you do them the wrong way, what ends up happening is you take all your customers that were otherwise going to pay for a more expensive thing and they just buy a cheaper thing. That's bad.
(06:46) So, we want to present the offer in such a way that we get all the people who are going to buy the first thing that was the most expensive and then also capture additional sales from customers who otherwise would have said no. I'll walk through that in in a second in terms of more details. The fourth element is continuity.
(07:04) Because if you just got a bunch of cash up front from people and you upsold and downsold, well, then what do you have after that? Well, you have a one-time transaction. We don't get customers to make sales. We make sales to get customers. And the point there is we create a relationship with a customer that increase the likelihood they continue to purchase from us again and again.
(07:16) There are offer structure that each of these objective points that increase the likelihood that that objective occurs. We want to have an offer that gets people in the door. We want to have an offer that gets them to spend more money.
(07:28) We would have an offer that captures the other part of people who who weren't originally going to say yes. And then we want them to have something that that gets them to buy over and over again. If we have those things, we have a model that can outspend our competition. At least in the most basic way, outspend the cost of getting customers. If we think about what is required for a business to exist, you have to have cash. That's literally it.
(07:46) Like you could have nothing else, but as long as you can pay your bills, as long as you can payroll, as long as you can pay the incorporation fee every year to maintain a business, you are still in business. Your ego might be bruised, you might have lower revenue, you might not be hitting the goals you want, but you are still in business.
(08:02) If you have a money model that increases the cash flow in the business and pulls it forward, then by doing that, you have a way that you can stay alive. And what I have found from all the people that I've known in in my life, and I would say myself included, is that business is an endurance game. It's a marathon. It's about staying alive and outlasting. And the way that you outlast is you continue to have ways to generate cash flow for the business. So, I'm going to walk you through the model that broke the gym industry.
(08:21) So when I got into the gym game, what people ran was something called an LBO, which is not a leverage buyout, but they called it that because it was a low barrier offer. All right? And so this is what those gyms did at the time. So they would run a $21 21-day promotion, right? So that was their front-end offer.
(08:37) That was their attraction offer. Now, is that a good attraction offer? Not by my standards, but it was an attraction offer for me. This would probably be a downell, but for them, this is what they were running on the front end. And what's really interesting about all the offer structures that I mentioned in the Money Models book, which you'll soon learn about, is that all of those offers can be used anywhere, but I tend to bucket them in this way because I think they better satisfy this specific objective. Back to the story. They were running $21 21day promotions. And this
(09:02) is back when people could in a local market convert maybe 25 or even 30% of leads. Lead quality has gone down on those platforms. But let's just let's just walk through it with uh with like really bullcase scenario, the best case scenario. So, they're closing one out of four leads.
(09:20) So, let's say they get a 100 leads, which would cost them, let's say that their their lead cost was 20 bucks. All right? So, it's going to cost them $2,000 to get 100 leads. Okay. Fine. Now, they're going to convert 25% of these leads and their price point is going to be $21, which means that they're going to make $525. Well, that's in the first 21 days. Now, of these 25, what percentage of these people are going to convert to continuity? this guy, the membership.
(09:46) Well, the industry average for these types of trials is 35%. So, let's just call it a third and say eight of those people are going to convert. And let's say that their price point is $99. All right. So, now they have another $800 here. Okay, fine.
(10:05) Now, the average stay of a customer that's at $99 a month is going to be usually, and this is kind of sad, somewhere in the neighbor of like fiveish months for the industry average. It's much lower than you think it is. And so that means that they've got another $4,000 that's going to come in off of these eight people. So all we have to do is add this up.
(10:23) So they got $525, they got 800 at the conversion and then they got five more months. I'm actually technically giving them six, but let's just let's let's give it to them. That means they were at 4,800 plus that we're at 5325. Now, if they spent $2,000 to make that, it's okay.
(10:41) you know, they made some money, but they still have rent, they have admin, they have trainers, they have other stuff that has to get factored into this. I'm not even taking into account gross profit here, which is a huge factor. All right, but let's just leave it at these numbers. That's okay. You can kind of compete. You'll live, but you're probably not going to make much. And so, this is what I did in the gym industry, and this is what changed the game.
(10:57) I'll put this little number here. So, remember we had 100 leads, right? Well, we got we made 5325, which means the maximum amount of money that we could spend, right, from these would be $53 per lead. Now, you couldn't actually realistically spend that money because you have every other cost in the business you'd have to spend and you'd be losing money. Let's just use that as a hypothetic.
(11:14) And again, I'm just trying to bolster this scenario. Now, what we did was this. Someone would come in and we ran a free sixe challenge or a six week challenge, 42-day detox, 42-day transformation, tons of different rappers, but basically a six week thing. All right? And so let's say we got our same hundred leads.
(11:31) Now our 100 leads, especially if we had a free offer on the front end, would be usually about half the cost. And so that means that let's say we were spending, you know, they spent 20 bucks a lead, we'd spend 10. Now I'm going to again I'm going to make this the worst case scenario for this one. So let's say we spent 20.
(11:47) We spent the same amount for these leads, even though we wouldn't. Let's just say we did. So we spent the same $2,000 to get these leads. Great. All right. These are our leads. Let's say we convert even less of these leads. All right. Let's say that we're going to convert 15% of these leads. So, we're going to get 15 15 sales. Now, important point.
(12:04) I had the perspective that when someone signs up for something like a gym, their highest point of motivation is the moment they walk in the door. That is when they're the most deprived of the outcome. They literally they're they're so in pain that they booked, you know, they booked an appointment, they clicked a lead, they opted in, they responded to a a phone call, they got in their car, they drove all the way there. They're ready to change. That is the point that I'm not trying to sell someone something for 20 bucks. I'm trying to sell them
(12:26) something for $500, right? The point of greatest pain. Now, maybe it's $5,000, but at the at this point in my career, you know, $5,000 wasn't in my lexicon, so 500 was was high ticket. All right? I'd have 15 people that would come in and I'd sell them for five or 600 bucks. All right? So, let's just use 500 as simple math. So, we would make $7,500.
(12:44) Now, mind you, this is upfront. Upfront. So, that means that if I'm spending this money to get these customers in, I'm already positive. I still have my membership. I still have other things that I can sell on top of that. But remember here, we had to wait a month plus to get to this 5325. Here, I'm getting it day one.
(13:04) But after that, I realized, wait a second, all these 15 people, I'll bet you I could sell 12 of them on supplements. And so, the average person there would spend about 200 bucks. So, I'd sp I'd make $2,400. Now, gross profit on that, you actually have physical costs there, but I ran close to 80% gross profit on the products that I sold.
(13:25) that was roughly $2,000 in gross profit that I'd make from selling these 12 people. All right, but you'd be like, "Okay, well then that's already, you know, 9500 compared to the 53." And this is all within the first 48 hours because I'd sell these people within the first two days or so. And you might be thinking, "Wait a second. I thought they just bought a gym membership.
(13:42) Why would you sell them supplements afterwards?" Because people have different wallets. They have different needs that can get satisfied. And so just because you spent all your money on your membership doesn't mean you spent all of your supplement money.
(13:54) And once you spend all your supplement money, what else are you going to do? Well, you're going to have gym clothes, which is a different wallet. And then once you buy your gym clothes, what else are you going to buy? You probably have to get food that's going to be your new fitness food, right? So all of these things have these different buckets that customers are willing to spend money on.
(14:05) And the and the business that's able to capture the highest percentage of that money in the shortest period of time is the one that's going to be able to out compete and outspend. Now, let's continue. So for me, remember this is a six week thing that I sold them on. But does that mean that I wait till the end of the six weeks to sell them something else after the supplements? Of course not.
(14:21) What would I do? Well, I would say, "Hey, we can take your $500 here and if you want, we can credit it forward for the year." How's that sound? If you just choose to stay with us afterwards. Now, in the first scenario, I've got no I've got no leverage, right? I can't say like, "Hey, you gave me $21.
(14:40) Let me put that $21 towards your $99." It's like, who cares, right? But if I said, "Hey, I'm going to take your $500 and put it towards a year." That's real money. And so all of a sudden, I could get somewhere in the neighborhood of around 70% of people, so double the percentage here, to take the next offer.
(14:59) And so I take my 15 originally, and I've got about 10 who stay on the back end. Now, at this point, because I learned a little bit more about pricing, instead of charging 99, I'd be charging $ 250 a month. And then that would knock me down to about $200 per month for my large group training studio. Now, that means that I've got $200 per month, which means $2,000 per month in recurring.
(15:18) Now, let's assume that I had the same stick as them. Let's just assume that. Well, now I've got $10,000 here, right? In total, because times five, five months. So, I got 10 grand here. But wait a second. Do you think there's anything else we could do? Great idea. I said I had six weeks, right? And I got a percentage of these people to say, "Hey, I'm going to continue on and credit my money." Fine.
(15:38) What What happens at week six here? Well, I would still weigh them out from their from their promotion that I had, but what else would I do? I'd say, "Hey, you're already committed for the year. If you want, we can save you another 10% if you just prepay today. I saved you 500 on the first one. I'm going to save you another 200 or 400 if you take 10 or 20% off.
(15:55) " Like, why not? And I would get somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 to 30%ish. Not a promise, not a guarantee that if you do this, this is what's going to happen. I'm just giving you a rough estimate, right? And so that means that I'm going to get two or three people which kind of factor I'll say in my experience it's like 20ish% of customers so one out of five will buy something that's significantly more expensive.
(16:18) So customers tend to be fractal 8020 right and so here I would get somebody to then spend call it $2,000. And so I'd make let's just call this $5,000. We can take the average here. $5,000 extra. Now let's add up the difference here. My competitors could spend up to $50 a lead. That was very important right? 53 bucks elite is what they were able to spend.
(16:41) But if we're adding ours up, I'm going to get 7500 2,000 9500 10,000 19,500 plus five. So I've got 24,500 that I'm making from the same 100 leads, remember? Which means that my ability to spend is that I can spend $245 per lead at max. Here obviously I have other costs, etc. But I just want to make the math example simple. compared to my competitor who could only spend $53 per lead. 5x, not like 20% more or 50% more, but five times more.
(17:12) And all of this money, and this is where it got weird, all of this money minus this 5K was in the first 30 days. Which means that if I spent money on ads and I put it on a credit card and I was able to make $19,500 after I originally just put $2,000 in, I'm getting $8 $9 back for every dollar I put in. And I still have the lead. I still have the customers.
(17:38) I can still sell sell them lean by Halloween and Slim for Santa. And I can still sell them semi-private training. I can still sell them other stuff, more supplements, right, throughout the rest of the relationship with the customer. And when you do this, now let's let's think about how why this is important. Why why I bring up money models. The guys that I that I was competing against functionally sold the same product as me. Maybe my trainers are better.
(17:56) Maybe my location's a little bit better. But fundamentally, they had trainers. They had access to the same talent pool I did locally. They had to pay their trainers probably roughly what I was paying my trainers. And so, how was it that I could out compete them so clearly? I had a better money model.
(18:15) And so right now there's probably a version of your business that can generate five, 10, 15 times more than somebody who's in identical space as you. And I want to push on this because a lot of business owners have very limiting beliefs in saying like, I don't think I could charge that much. I can't I couldn't I couldn't ask someone to buy supplements 2 days after they bought after they bought a membership. Why not? They're going to buy them either way. Might as well buy them from you.
(18:32) But they didn't finish the the six weeks or they didn't finish the trial. Why would I ask them to buy something else? Because they've had a good experience up to this point. and you make an offer so good they can't refuse. Key point here is it's a deliberate sequence of offers that's structured to generate as much cash upfront as humanly possible and maximize the likelihood of conversion into continuity or reoccurring.
(18:56) And if you can accomplish that and for each of these elements there's multip so like let's walk through some of the examples here. their money model, call it a free trial almost, but a low ticket front-end offer that was basically a a paid trial functionally. And then they just had a continuity offer on the back end, which is $99 a month, but there was no mechanic. There was no there was no there was no lubricant there.
(19:16) It's just, hey, you bought this thing. You're the end of your trial. Do you want to buy the next thing? What's crazy is that this is how a lot of businesses run. But the thing is is that wouldn't it be more compelling if we said, "Hey, you want to take the $21 and put it towards something like that would be more compelling than just saying buy the next thing." So now let me show you the pieces that are involved in this one.
(19:35) So we had a win your money back as offer one, which is an attraction offer, which then rolled into a classic upsell, which is the supplement offer. You can't buy X without Y. which then rolled into a rollover upsell, which is how I took the cash that they had here and put it towards membership.
(19:57) It's the third, which is uh which is an upsell offer combined with a continuity offer. And then I did a buy X to get Y, which was the paid and full discount. Buy 10 months, get two months free as the offer at the end. Now, are all of these continuity offers? Well, two of these are kind of, but the mechanics behind what make the offer compelling is the components of the money model.
(20:22) That lubrication, that reason why, that compelling thing that gets someone to say yes more likely than no, that is what can transform a business. And these are the tricks of the trade that people rarely share publicly. And it's because it's the engine. It's the machine. I've spent the last 13, 14 years documenting all the little things, the little nuances, the how I say this and then that gets them to say this.
(20:42) And if I present the price like this first and then I say this, then I get way more people to take it. Those mechanics are what create a money model. Want to hear something insane? My next book, $100 million Money Models, is finally coming out.
(21:00) Want to hear something else insane? Every single person who shows up live to the book launch event gets a secret project that I've been working on for over two years. And I can't tell you what it is, but it's less than a bitcoin and it's more than an NFT. And every single person who shows up gets one. And what's that? Oh, yeah.
(21:16) If you choose to pre-order a copy of the book, there's four amazing bonuses that you get absolutely free if you just choose to pre-order it because it helps my warehouse team out. It would mean a lot to me. You don't have to do it because what's that? Oh, yeah. You can show up for free. And so, no obligation either way. I would love to see you there, but the free prizes are there only if you show up live. So, click register and it's going to be awesome.
(21:34) And so where does money models fit within kind of the universe of the $100 million series, right? The first book, $100 million offers teaches how to create an offer so good people feel stupid saying no. Said differently, if you were selling a straight membership, you're going to lose compared to somebody who's selling a transformation.
(21:52) If you're selling, hey, just come get workouts versus, hey, we're going to do a grocery store tour with you once a week to make sure that you know what to buy. And on top of that, you're going to have an accountability coach who's going to check in with you every morning to make sure that you weigh in and that you're, you know, attending your workout later. And on top of that, you're going to have a group of people who are just like you who are going alongside.
(22:10) And we also have prizes for people who are winning. On top of that, we've got meals that we can you can order through us if you want that are already, you know, pre-approved. We also have these supplements that can help you feel better and make this feel less bad as you're doing it.
(22:27) You go through all the different potential issues that someone might have and we say, "How do we flip all of the objections that someone has and make it into an offer?" If you don't have an offer, there's nothing you can sell, right? You will sell a commodity. Memberships between two boot camps is the same thing. But if we have a transformation, now all of a sudden we have more stuff that's going to be more compelling and more differentiated, which will then allow us to command a higher price. I had to start there because if you don't have an offer to sell, there's nothing I can do.
(22:49) The next is leads, right? So once you have the offer, you're like, "Okay, I got the I got the thing I'm going to sell. I've got my transformation, whatever, whatever your transformation is, right? How am I going to let people know about it? Leads shows you how to advertise, how to get leads, how to get customers, right? Which is either you're going to have some sort of content that you're making, you're posting stuff.
(23:09) You're going to have some sort of outreach that you do, which is you DM, you cold call, you you you're you're you're emailing. You have some sort of advertisements that are paid that you run. And you can do those to get customers to send you referrals. You can do those to get affiliates who also send you customers as well, right? And so those are the different sources that you're going to get.
(23:28) I can go into more details, but that's that is the gist of $100 million leads. And so now you're like, I got a thing and I got a way to let people know about it. Well, then the money model comes in is to connect all the dots is it puts it runs the water through the funnel through the pipeline. And the idea is we put the advertising in on this side and money comes out the other side.
(23:48) And so it teaches you how to get more customers to pay more money faster over and over again with all four types of offer structures that when you design a good money model, you're going to use multiple. I told you I just I gave you four that I was using in this money model. And by combining those Lego blocks and you're going to for your own business mix and match, there's five attraction offers that I have in the book.
(24:06) It's like, okay, I'm going to use attraction offer one here. I'm going to use upsell offer two here. I'm going to use attraction offer four here. and I'm going to use downell offer two and three here. And then I'm going to use continuity offer four on the back. When you put that together, that is how you assemble the business. That is how you outspend everyone.
(24:24) That is how when Facebook ads become expensive, you don't care. And that's why that guy goes out of business and you stay in business and you keep growing. Believe it or not, the offers, leads, and money models books were actually all one book that I first started writing in 2021 and it was called Lead Generation and Monetization Structures. very very sexy title.
(24:43) And so I wrote it as a textbook because I I thought I was an academic. I thought I was, you know, very fancy. When I wrote it though, the thing is I had a couple meaty sections in that I was like, "Man, this is like really really dense. I feel like I have to unpack this." Believe it or not, the lead's book actually was just one very long chapter in that book.
(24:59) And I was like, "Okay, I need to I need to talk more about this. Like no one's going to be able to just take this chapter and then immediately use it." So I had to write the leads book. But then I was writing the leads book. I was like, "Well, shoot. None of these ads are going to work.
(25:10) none of this posting content is going to work unless they have an offer. So then I had to peel out the offer section, which was really the very beginning of the book, just saying, "Hey, you got to have something compelling to sell that people don't price compare you on. Here's the how you make an offer. Here's how you put it together. Here's the value equation. These all together are actually one system of acquisition.
(25:29) Now, to be clear, you could take just the leads book and advertise your stuff and you'll make more. more people find out about whatever it is you have. Even if you have just the most basic membership in the world, more people find out about it, you'll have more customers, right? If you only had a better offer, if you go from a membership to a sixe challenge, you're going to have a more compelling offer. More people will buy.
(25:48) Sometimes systems have multiple dependent components. So like for a car, if I don't have wheels, the car won't go. But if I have wheels and I don't have an engine, the car still won't go. On the other hand, if I have a pipeline of water that's going through a pipe, if I make one part thicker or thinner, I can still increase the throughput of the pipe overall.
(26:07) And so, in this type of setup, all of these are additive. They're multiplicative. All of these things just make businesses better. Think of them as business enhancers, if you will. Sometimes you're only one crazy offer away. You're only one big advertising campaign away, or you need the cash flow to support both of those things through having a superior money model. And so to be clear, you don't need to read offers or leads in order to use money models.
(26:31) But if you do, it'll be even better. But you don't need to. Just like if you don't read money models, you can just advertise more and your business will grow. The followup question might be like, what if I have a small business or a big business? Like, how will it work for me? Well, it doesn't matter what industry or size you're in. A money model is core to every business.
(26:48) The question is just how good yours is and how many different components you've implemented so that you can maximize each of those objectives. This is the most how to win at business manual that I've ever made. And I truly believe that it will change people's businesses and lives more than anything I've ever released.
(27:06) And to be clear, gym launch as a business was functionally structured on just having superior money model in two ways. I showed a superior money model for gyms to run, which allowed them to advertise in more ways, in more places, more profitably, get better talent so they could out compete people in their area. But I also had a superior money model at the gym launch level.
(27:24) my business that showed how this money model worked because other people were in that space trying to help gym owners out whether they were marketing agencies or they were they sold courses or whatever they sold to the same avatar, right? Equipment companies, all of these companies sold to the exact same avatar. If we think about it like this, you have a person that your business sells to.
(27:42) And this person is going to have, let's say it's a gym owner, he's going to have equipment dealers who are trying to get his his eyeballs. You're going to have supplement sellers who are going to try and get them to wholesale. You're going to have uh marketing agencies who are going to say, "Hey, you know, buy, you know, buy our services.
(28:01) " You're going to have construction companies which are going to say, "Hey, do remodels for your gym." You're going to have apparel companies that are trying to say, "Hey, use our apparel line to, you know, to to do it at your gym." And so, all of these people have to buy ads on the same person. All of them are buying advertising space for these eyeballs. In an auction of attention, the person who can outspend, let's say this one's the biggest, can have an ethical and legal monopoly of the attention of their prospect or their ideal avatar simply because of the economics of their business. They make more money on this person's eyeballs than all of these people. And so for all of the blank
(28:40) spaces on this person's news feed, this guy can put his barbell ads over and over again. And so what happens is that you can actually outspend and increase the CPMs in your marketplace such that no one else can compete. Hopefully you see the difference between a generic gym that sells a membership and this gym model and the biggest one is how the money works, how the money flows, how quickly, and to whom.
(29:08) And when you have that, you can be this business that outspends the remainder of other businesses that compete for the same attention. And by doing that, you can win. This is an overview of the conceptual hierarchy of the ideas that are contained within the Money Models book.
(29:25) These are the nitty-gritty tactics that only the pros know and that most people keep close to their chest. I always know that a book is good when I feel very insecure before I release it because I'm like, "Oh my god, these are all my secrets. What am I going to do?" But I've learned enough times that uh the more money I make other people, the more money I end up making.
(29:41) If you're like, "Man, this sounds really interesting or this sounds really cool." Then I'm having the launch event of the season. I'm spending millions of dollars on the launch event just because I want to blow you guys away. You can register for the live launch event. It's August 16th. You can register for it now. It's register.acq.com. What's beautiful about this is that the whole event's free.
(29:59) I've got five mystery speakers that are coming out. They're headliners and they've never shared the same stage before and many of them don't speak publicly much at all. It's gonna be awesome.
(30:12) But beyond that, I'm going to be showing you the concepts in this book in real time and I'm gonna be pulling them out and you like you probably even heard some of these things that I said today and you're like, "Oh, I could use something like that." Well, imagine an entire book of those and you'll be able to pre-order a book before the uh before the live launch event because it actually helped my warehouse team out a lot. And so to incentivize you, I've got four amazing bonuses that you can find out about when you go to the register.acq.com page.
(30:29) And I have a surprise gift that I have been uh saving for a while now that I've been working on for more than one year, multiple years in anticipation of this event that I will be releasing live at the launch. And every single person who shows up live will get one. And uh I can't say what it is yet, but I can tell you that it's it's better than an NFT and it's less than a Bitcoin.
(30:55) And every single person will get one, but you got to be there live. All right. So it's register.acq.com. Over the next four weeks, I'm gonna be revealing one model per week.
