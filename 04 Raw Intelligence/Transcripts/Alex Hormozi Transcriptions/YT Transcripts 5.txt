Transcript:
(00:00) before I met my wife I never cracked $3 million per year and after I met my wife 24 months later I took home over 17 million in personal income and there are 17 lessons that she taught me so the first one I learned from her was never stifle a generous impulse whether it's a gift or praise as soon as you think it send it and so when I started you know my businesses earlier on I obviously you know I got up to about 30 employees between my gyms honestly I was not that good at running it and it was because I just ran everything off of fear and Punishment and it sounds more malicious
(00:35) than it probably was that's just kind of how like most small business owners operate is they just kind of like yell at people when they mess up and if I'm not talking to you it means you're doing everything fine which is kind of like the opposite of how you want to run a business because then that means that you just condition everyone to fear talking to you because it means when you talk to them you only there to punish them and so then your employees start avoiding you and they don't tell you what's going on in the business and so when Lila came in she had come from uh
(00:58) had two really positive working environments that worked out before and one really negative one and she had seen the big contrast the thing that really motivated her and just transparently has been one of the secret star of success is that she's always wanted to have an amazing place to work as in create and Foster an environment where people feel safe and comfortable and praised for the work they do and the smart thing about that is that you have kind of two levels of effort that you can unlock in every person so the first level which is what most people work at which is the minimum amount to not get punished and so if you
(01:28) punish someone if they do anything below this then they just go right above that so they basically do the law of least effort so they just go right above that just enough to not get punished and that's how most people live their lives it's also really unfulfilling kind of sucks and people don't live to their potential and your business doesn't grow nearly as much as it could the second level is a completely different fuel that unlocks something that we call a discretionary effort which is all of the effort between what someone needs to do
(01:51) just to keep their job and as much as they possibly could if they did their best all of that upside is discretionary effort because you wouldn't fire them even at the bottom but everything else on on top of that is kind of like gravy and so she has been so good at unlocking discretionary effort in all of our teammates because she really genuinely Fosters people and coaches them and has very fast feedback loops we run everything on a project management tool and so she's in there all day long just being like awesome job this is great keep completing that this is awesome work hey can you ask me here and she's
(02:21) just all day long so people are getting really fast feedback loops from her constantly for little iterations of work and so people want to do more things faster CU they get more feedback faster from so that's number one on the other level from a grander level every single employee comes in fills out a form and we learn the things they like they don't like favorite foods that kind of stuff and when someone does something great she will immediately find their employee profile remember the thing that uh they said they really liked and then usually send a gift that's related whether it's a gift card or an animal or a jersey or
(02:49) whatever the thing is that they kind of like and it shows people that you really listen and that you care and the best way to make people think that you care about them is to actually care about them um and Lila does it better than just about anyone and so I would say that is the one of the biggest reasons that we were able to unlock much more operationally complex businesses is because people wanted to work I would say for us but realistically for her um and they felt they were be invested in and so they were willing to invest back to the business the second one is that you never regret taking a night to sleep
(03:24) on an emotional response but you do regret the ones done in the moment and so when I think back to before Lila I would often have bad news or something bad that would happen and I almost like got off on being angry like being enraged feels good like it feels like you're just like in absolute power mode but then like afterwards you have like an anger hangover and I definitely did that a lot in my earlier career and I'd regret it and then you basically Foster an abusive relationship and I don't I use that lightly but more so just that there's a cycle of anger and then
(03:55) apology and then anger and apology and it's just a it's a it's not good for either party and so what she got me to do was basically slow down she's like hey I get you're upset if you're still upset tomorrow chew their head off and nine times out of 10 I'd wake up the next day and be like it's fine they didn't mean it it wasn't malicious intent it was just dumb and whatever and then we asked the question how can we decrease the likely this happens again in the future and then we can be productive about it rather than just
(04:19) insulting or assassinating someone's character and she honestly is almost a freak at this point of being able to like sit in the middle of like uncomfortable conversations and have Zero Effect it's been amazing for our marriage uh because like I can escalate um in terms of getting angry and more aggressive and despite being a girl who's smaller than me so I don't care what you say if you're a bigger guy and there's a girl and you're alone and you get angry they get scared I don't care what they say it just like it's a it's a physical Instinct and she has been able
(04:50) to tame that in her mind and even when I can get like more heated she'll just say like I totally understand where you're coming from like let's talk through it let's figure it out and um even just seeing her do that has helped me learn to just like regulate my own emotional responses to stimul a lot better number three stress doesn't mean there's anything wrong it means you're alive and so one of the things Ila jokes about is like dead people problems it's like if we want to not have stress about some she's like ah those are dead people problems like if if we have zero stress
(05:18) it means we're dead right and so um the converse of that or the inverse of that is that if we feel stress it means we're doing things and it means that we care and so I think that reframing anxiety as just care Ing and there being nothing wrong with that um has basically stopped the second line of dialogue of self judgment around being stressed around stuff and more times than not I used to get more stressed about my stress than I was getting stressed about the thing I was getting stressed about and so the amount of stressors that come up in
(05:50) business every single day are countless and wherever you put your attention everything else flows and so being able to remove the Judgment around caring as I now see it um basically released me from all of that wasted attention and so the amount of productivity that increased as a result of not judging myself on those things was huge the way that she saw stress and stuff just helped me just be even more chill and all of these kind of lad her up to making better decisions and you know if you think back to the problems that you had 10 years ago whatever they are you probably laugh at
(06:23) the size of the problems you had then compared to now and I try and forward cast that to 10 years from now I will laugh at the problems that have today and so like as we get bigger we expand and so hoping or wishing that we don't have problems is wishing that we don't win because if you really want to have no problems then it means you're wishing that you fail number four you can feel bad and do nothing about it man this is like if Lila has a [ __ ] Jedi power it's this is that she can sit in discomfort for a very long time and said
(06:54) she's like oh I feel terrible about this and then most people are like what are you going to do about it and she's like oh nothing yeah nothing I'm just going to feel terrible and that's okay and just the acceptance of like the fact that I feel terrible is an emotion which has nothing to do with the actions that I'm choosing to take because every action that I would take as a result of feeling this discomfort is only going to lead me further away from my goal or cause me to act in a way that's not conducive to what I want and often times
(07:18) when we go to New Growth levels there is discomfort that's why it's called Growing Pains not growing gains right it's painful to grow because you have change you have stretch marks it's literally what you have when you grow and so the discomfort is a requisite for growth and so to try and then do something about it expends effort where none is needed and it actually detracts from the growth you actually grow more slowly by trying to combat your discomfort rather than accepting it for what it is as a requisite for the success that you want to have number five and this one's big
(07:52) longterm over everything I know what we're going to do by the time we're dead and it isn't worth trading that for anything today that could take away from it and like Leila breathes this like she is so long-term thinking like I really have learned I would say Almost 100% of my long-term thinking from her um because she is just so unwilling to sacrifice anything in the short term that will take away from the long-term goals that we have and I tend to be like and I think that's a little bit of our yin and yang and so I tend to move faster I tend
(08:19) to break things I tend to be more okay with imperfect like MVP you know menim of viable product like let's get it out there and just see what the market wants things like that and on the flip side she's so protective of our reputation of making sure that customer have an exceptional experience in whatever we do but I think we've learned of one another in that way but if you're somebody who's more like me and if you watch my content maybe you do resonate more with that um if you don't have Aila then maybe taking
(08:43) some of these lessons that I have learned might help you the same way they help me which is like you might want to take an extra second and make sure it really does what you say it does because the one thing that can guarantee that you don't get to where you want to go is that people think you're a liar and a liar has a very strong connotation but a a lot of marketing from a lot of people is exaggeration to the point of like it not being true number six the quality of your business is directly proportional
(09:09) to the quality of the people you hire which is directly proportional to your character and your ability to cast a Clear Vision and how they fit in it not just how you accomplish your own goals and so I would say early Alex was very much like they're like What's the mission of the business and I was like to make lots of money that was the mission of the business make Alex Rich um even if that is your mission don't say that and so she was like no one wants to work for that she and she would look at me she be like I don't want to work for that and I'd be like [ __ ] fine
(09:39) and so as I've tried to work on myself and very transparently since Lila joined me Lila has exceptional character and honestly the internet will never know because only the people who work in our company can really know how great of a human being she is um but and unfortunately no one will believe me cuz I'm her husband and people think that I'm fluffing her so whatever but you can judge the validity of that statement based on the quality of the people that we bring in because really wonderful people wouldn't work for people who
(10:06) sucked and Lea is exceptional and so because of that I've been able to have people who work in my companies who are way above what I could probably attract to my own and it's all been because of um honestly her Relentless Drive in personal development like she actually has done more personal development work than I think like than anyone I know um and just continually trying to get better I mean one of the the reasons that I married Lila early on I said and I told her this it's was like in a word I was like you're just coachable like she takes feedback like she actually
(10:37) only requires one piece of feedback to make a permanent change it's I haven't seen anyone like that in my life like I'll give you an example like when I um in the very beginning of our relationship like she would like she would laugh at like a joke or something and she'd be like ah you're stupid like she'd say like that joke and um I think she did a couple times and I was just like hey uh probably my own thing I was like but I don't like when you say that from that day she's never said it again the thing is is like the world's a lot smaller than people think it is especially the higher up you go and especially the more talented people you
(11:05) get because like winners hang around winners and so it's funny cuz like all the guys on my media team who were like the high up dudes know the guys who were on high up media teams at all other places and they all talk and I know who's an [ __ ] and is a dick to their team and guess what happens when that guy is dissatisfied for a day he comes to my team because hopefully our guys are like these guys are cool like like we work hard but we work hard cuz we want to we want to do a good job and so that that culture has been because of the
(11:37) Relentless effort Ila has done to work on herself so that she can translate that into her team which then translates that outwards because if you think about building an asset which is what a business is or what it should become if you want to create something of value it's never about how much you can do it's about how much you can organize everyone in a singular Direction which is why I said cast a Clear Vision because sure like on one level if you're a great person great great then you can attract great people but great people will still only be there because there's
(12:03) an ambition component which is okay you're cool got it that's checkbox one check boox 2 I have a dream for my life does my dream fit within yours and so you have to cast a vision big enough that someone else's dream can fit inside of it I genuinely think that Lela sees organization as a vehicle for personal development for everyone in the company and the fact that we do business I really genuinely think for her is secondary so there's an exceptional book on this by Patrick wiy called the motive and she asked me to read it for like 2 years and I just didn't because I'm a
(12:34) wonderful husband um and so one day and it's like it's like a 100 pages I read it in 90 minutes before she woke up one day like I literally sat down it was like sitting on the counter I was like ah [ __ ] I'll read it and I I just I read it cover to cover in one sitting and she came in to like have coffee with me in the morning and I just looked at her I was like I get it I'm really sorry and if like I highly recommend if you're a small business owner or you're an operator you're somebody who actually runs your business read the motive
(13:00) um it I was the the bad guy in the example and it shows what it looks like to be a good operator of a business and it was literally the exact opposite of everything I did number seven be fast to extend trust and be even faster to take it back and so I tend to be the more trusting of the two of us remember I'm the Yes man you know someone's like I'll do XYZ I'm like sure he said he'd do it why wouldn't he do it she's like did you not see the flashing scam sign over his head that just Vegas lighting to being like I'm a scam and I was like oh [ __ ] no I didn't see that and so the amount
(13:34) of um mistakes one that she's helped me avoid but secondly that Lila will still extend trust and she does that and I would say that this particular kind of quoter ism is more about the team so I was really fast to extend trust externally to vendors and Partnerships and things like that but really slow to extend internally and I think she is that flipped is that she's really slow to extend trust to people outside but the inside if she's like okay if you passed all these walls you're in now like you're in like you're on the team and we will treat you like you are on
(14:05) the team but if you give us reason to not trust you we will take that back and so that is how I think she's kind of like protected the kingdom if you want to say it that way um that I've learned a lot from her and so I think it's the internal external kind of dichotomy that was flipped between the two of us um and I think because she extend trust um people trust us back and that was something like in my organizations that was just run by me earlier I didn't trust anyone and no one trusted me number eight don't require three strikes
(14:33) to get someone out of your life if someone shows you their colors believe them the first time this one I think Lea's [ __ ] queen of I tend to give Second Chances again this is more externally Partners this guy did this thing in the past you know maybe he was indicted for fraud it was a misunderstanding Leela's been just very adamant that like if someone has a history of something I don't want to be their come up story like let someone else take that shot I'll I'll I'll be after that because there's a enough people who have just crushed it and been awesome the whole time and haven't
(15:03) [ __ ] anyone over let's just work with them and um we have avoided a lot of Calamity because the amount of times that I have done that and been burned um is honestly the majority of the time as as ugly as that sounds and I I I want to believe in Redemption and I I do I think but I think I want to believe in it in some on someone else's D number nine punishment only get short-term obedience praise gets long-term loyalty this is really interesting that took me a long time to figure out so from a human
(15:35) behavior perspective um punishment Fades over time and so let me give you an example so if if you ever like drank too much one weekend you wake up the next day and you're like hung over you're like I'm never going to drink again and then the next weekend you're out there partying what happened is the punishment associated with The Hangover faded but the reward associated with getting drunk and partying stays the same it's the same reason if you break up with somebody months later you think about the good times but you forget about the bad times you ever see them again then all of a sudden it all comes rushing
(16:03) back you're like oh my God this person sucks what was I thinking right you remember it all because punishment Fades reward stays over time and I'm going to get really real I think the reason that people speak really nicely about people who've been dead for a long time is that that person has never had the ability to punish them anymore for a very long time and they only remember the good things all that to say in an organization you can absolutely get someone to do whatever you want want if you punish them like if I hold a gun to somebody's head that's a threat of punishment you can get them to
(16:33) adhere for the most part but the moment you remove the punishment you remove the threat they behave exactly the way they were going to before but if you reward they will always want to have that reward and it does not fade and so if you want the team to continue to act the same way when you are not there then using reward rather than punishment is a better long-term strategy the problem is and this is what confounds everything is that you can get way faster results with punishment and so you have to be more patient and more willing to continue to invest in people
(17:06) when they mess up not get angry and continue to only reward the good things so that you Orient their behavior in that way but then you have a longer on-ramp but then they are way more self-sufficient long term so you get higher Returns on an employee by investing longer in the short term so you get better long-term rewards whereas punishment you can change their behavior quickly but you always have to keep punishment and you also have to increase your punishment so if you're the type of Boss who just always yells the same way eventually people get immune to it and so you actually have to increase the
(17:36) intensity and variety of punishment in order to keep it effective just getting into Behavior stuff um and that sounds like a terrible way to live and so from her I have seen her just use reward she just dos out reward in such a strategic like she's like a uh she's Surgical and how she can pinpoint how to give reward at the right time for the right people for the right activities and Orient the organization so quickly towards the cookies or nuggets that she puts out that everyone just gets excited and she
(18:05) does it to me too because hey I likes being rared too and so the thing about human behavior is that even if you understand it it still works I'll give you a really micro example so we had uh someone on our team who we always really enjoyed filming with and we wanted to uh put that person in Char of the whole department and we're like okay well how do we get someone else to be just as good at filming with us and so we were like okay well can't just tell people like be good at filming we like what is it about that person that makes them so
(18:35) good to film with and what we realized when we broke it down one of the things is that like when we were talking they would not along like they were listening to what we were saying and so for you you're just a camera right now but you're watching this as a person but for me I'm just looking at a camera and so having someone behind who's like giving me feedback in real time created a short reinforcement or reward Loop that made it more enjoyable to film with and so for us identifying that little Loop made the whole thing more enjoyable and so in all aspects of business there are these
(19:04) little short reward Loops that we can identify and then get really tactical good about them and incentivize those things and now when we bring someone in they know that there's three four five six activities that somebody who behind a camera has to do that makes them excellent behind a camera and then we can onramp people and reward them for those activities because those activities reward the person who's doing the recording and then that becomes The Virtuous cycle of reward and that becomes really fun and profitable 10
(19:29) then you cannot ask anyone for things you don't already give them think patience trust forgiveness so I said earlier that Lila extends trust first she extends forgiveness first she is patient with others first and so I I would say earlier on in my career probably still a little bit now I demand things from people that I might not have given them or demonstrated first and so over time I've learned through her demonstration I've learned from her that she just demonstrates whatever she wants and as more people like to Model Behavior it's how humans
(20:04) learn if she does something then people will do it too and so kind of like the monkey see monkey do thing I learned that talk is really cheap from her and what your actions do through demonstration speaks volumes and she can change the entire behavior of a team by just acting the way she acts and then people act in accordance with that 11 be fiercely competitive with yourself ignore everyone else I spent way too much of my earlier years in business before Lila looking at what my competition was doing I would obsess over their ads over what they were saying over what they were producing over what their workouts work remember
(20:40) that I was in Fitness and I was like they're sending people over to steal my workout I swear to God I was like I would like worry that they were stealing my workouts just crazy stuff and you know what some of them were but like who cares like if they're stealing your workouts it means you're doing better than them it means they're trying to copy you and Lila was just so good like Lila is Fier competitive only against herself and it like truly is like she actually doesn't give a [ __ ] about what anyone else is doing and I uh definitely was really competitive with other people and then
(21:08) in so doing just wanted to do better because I wanted to beat them rather than because I wanted to get better as long as I was better than them I felt like I won and she basically helped me see she was like I think you have a lot more potential than beating these people she's like I think beating these people is a small goal and so it only put the bar above my nearest competitor rather than than what she believed I was capable of and I think that when you have somebody who believes in you like that you start to believe in them too number 12 listen to feedback the first
(21:38) time whether it's from friends family customers employee if it makes you better change it now no matter how bad it hurts I definitely had the uh kind of a little bit of a CEO bubble um before Ila and I uh started working together and so people never wanted to give me bad news because I would chew them out and so they stopped giving me bad news but it also meant that they stopped giving me the truth and so it becomes very difficult to win if you don't have the truth and so you make decisions based on data and the quality of your decisions based on the quality of the data and so you cannot say that you want
(22:08) to make the best decisions and also not be willing to listen and I definitely suffered that for a very long time because most times if you are presented with the data you can make really good Solutions like you I used to joke about this with our team I was like really good data makes you look like a genius because if the problems are obvious in the numbers you can just solve them where you get into trouble is is where you don't have the data and you're basically operating blind and a lot of people operate like that for years because their teams don't want to tell them anything and so Leila one solicits
(22:39) feedback two she encourages it and I would say she encourages it even more if it's negative and so and I'll be really real with you in the beginning they will say something mean because you will solicit the feedback and then you will have some sort of facial expression and then you still like you just have to power through it and be like please do it again I'm like I'm on this and I'll give you the magic question that she's asked that I think is one of my favorite questions for feedback which is what would you tell me
(23:06) if you knew I wouldn't get angry like what would you tell me if you knew it wouldn't upset me and it just opens up the form of like cuz it gives people the frame because a lot of things people would tell you if they didn't think it would upset you and so you say what would you tell me if you didn't think it would upset me and you get so much truthful feedback from people like hey you're really short or hey you're double to communicate with or hey you take really long to respond or hey you tend to be late on meetings and it really pisses everyone off like those are things that people say but if you don't
(23:31) solicit it that way and so I would encourage you even maybe even with your spouse to start but your team it's a really good exercise uh and you get some really good answers and a lot of times you get blind spots that you become made aware of and at least as far as I'm concerned like I would rather people talk [ __ ] to my face 13 this one's a meaty one all right so I'm just going to read this directly the best operators take action immediately on tasks they don't let anything sit on their desk they are delegation and accountability machines not quote systems people they get mounts of work done through leading
(24:00) others to think for themselves only dumb people need rules all right let's break this down a lot of earlier on business owners want to sop standard operating procedure every single component of a business the problem with that is that the business environment changes rapidly and by the time you have sopd everything everything has changed and so anything can be continually broken down into smaller and smaller scills if I said hey I need you to write a marketing campaign that is different and can be broken all
(24:25) the way down to turn on a computer navigate to Safari go to this URL here is how you type right like everything can get broken down but at a certain point you expect a certain level of confidence and the way to move quickly within an organization is to extend trust and have people who you trust to make decisions on your behalf in order for them to make decisions on your behalf which means that they can move quickly without having to standardize every single operating procedure is that they have shared values with you you say this is how we want things to be done and then you demonstrate those things
(24:52) being done so they know that you are not full of [ __ ] if people see you say this is what we do and then in the hard circumstances you act in accordance with those values and then you public reward the people who in hard circumstances also act in accordance with those values independent of your intervention of you interfering more people will do it like this one is is so prevalent so everybody who's under 10 million listen up true operators are leaders like it really took me a long time to figure this out it's not about systems like they like processes they just wave their hands and
(25:23) really what it means is they just like make everyone's life harder in order for a process to be put in place and stay within an organization it has to make a net benefit on the organization so there's something called local cost and Global cost or local benefits and Global benefits so I'll give you a simple example if I ask the sales team to write notes in the CRM it will have a local cost they will now have more work to do than they did before if those notes then get used by customer support and onboarding and product and delivery and they're really integral to the rest of
(25:50) their client experience there is going to be a global benefit so more people benefit the organization will benefit from this small cost that's a good return on investment often times quote systems people don't think that way they just think everything has to be somewhere and we have to put systems around everything and that often times slows people down and they cannot communicate what the global benefit is because if I don't use some of that information for example then maybe I shouldn't ask my sales guys to write that down because all I'm doing is
(26:14) incurring a local cost but I don't have a clear benefit and I'll give you a different example because I think this is such a prevalent issue in businesses I had an accounting team in one of our companies who said hey can we have some software developers write some code to automate this task that we do and I was like okay well how many hours a does it take they're like takes us like 4 hours of manual input every week I was like wow that's tough and so I went to software developers and I said hey you know what would it take to do this they're like oh we can do it in 14 days
(26:40) and I was like okay accounting team was like great can you sign off on this I was like okay hold up what is the cost of 14 days of a full Dev team doing this it's 5,000 a day FYI for this particular team and so 14 days times $5,000 70 grand you work for 4 hours a week on this thing so it's 52 Time 4 all right so it's 200 hours now you make $70,000 a year so 10% of your paycheck gets allocated towards this task so $7,000 so in order for me to get a return on this 14-day quick automation system it would
(27:12) take me 10 years and that's a pretty shitty return and that assumes that nothing changes over the next 10 years in our business that would cause us to have to update this thing break fix because we switch systems and I think you can get where I'm going with this of course it made no sense but quote system people will systematize without considering the long-term consequences and the global benefits of why they're even doing it to begin with they just get OCD about [ __ ] and they just want to system everything but all they do is slow people down but Lea has operated every business we've
(27:42) ever done and the reason they've gotten big is because she delegates Authority as soon as things come on her desk she shoots them out she's just a delegation machine and she trusts the people and so it's much more about empowering those people so that they can do the things the way they want them to be done as long as they still meet the objective and she gives way more Liberty because she chooses to hire more competent people which ladds up to some of the things earlier which is if you have really dumb people you have to make really strict rules and if you're
(28:05) already making strict rules you lost people will care about you and care about your business if you act like you care about them and the easiest way to act like you care about them is to actually care about them and so I um I would say prior to Lila I tend to be much more like a utilitarian in terms of how I thought about people like people are cogs in a machine we need to build a machine we need to assemble the cogs in place put some carrots and sticks and they will act in accordance with that and uh Leila with her much more Nuance understanding of human nature uh was
(28:37) like that's probably not the best way to do it and so um I I remember earlier on I was like I was like how do you how do you act like you care so much and she was like I do care Leila will always prioritize the human above the role and that's hard to do as a business owner and so I'll give you an like a very clear example that happens all the time in business that's really tough so let's say someone comes in and you invest a ton of time in them like you invest a lot of training a lot of a lot of real man- hours that you Mentor you coach the person up and after
(29:12) 6 months of all this investment you realize that the person is better fit doing something else not at the company and not saying like you're firing them but more like I think you can move on in doing something bigger or doing something somewhere else or even doing something at a competitor's business because you have an opportunity there l will genuinely say I really think you should take it and I am like [ __ ] you die but she doesn't think that way Leila really taught me how to just talk to the human and really put the human first and when
(29:44) we do that you get a huge Global benefit she has been so good at separating role from Human um that it's benefit us long term and then also here's the the second order of magnitude um comeback is that the person who does get Applause on the way out and has a I would say like a graceful exit those people feel like they owe you one because of how graceful the exit was and they will send customers your way they will send they will often times help you train up the next person they will help recruit for
(30:16) you and then long term if they do really well you might do business together and we've had every one of those incidents happen with people that have left our company and all of those opportunities and all of those doors would have been slammed shut if IID put their head on a spike number 15 do what you are most afraid of because it's usually the thing that you need to do most this is like a classic Leila you know example or question for strategy is she's like what are we most afraid of doing and she'll ask she'll ask the follow question like what would we do if
(30:46) we didn't think we could fail and I think you get really interesting kind of thought-provoking answers that come from that especially when you're thinking about strategic Direction big vision for where you're trying to go and most times we realize that we don't take take the big moves and a lot of times it's cuz they're painful and that's why we're afraid of them like there's a hard conversation like what do what do I what do I need to do right now there's this conversation I have to have and so it's
(31:09) like that's what I'm most afraid of right now it's usually the thing I need to do in the Fitness World to give a completely different parallel usually the exercises that you hate doing the most are the ones you usually need to do right um and so I feel I feel like it's almost a perfect Coral are in business is that like a lot of the thing like H I don't like reading our customer it's like dude you got to read them every day even though it's painful you got to read them right because you got to know how you can get better and that might be the thing that you're most TR it's like ah
(31:37) man I know our stuff's a little outdated but like H I don't want to like to go through all the work of like making an entirely new product or a V2 it's going to be so it's like what's the thing we're most afraid of doing it's probably the thing that you need to do and so she's again so good at embracing discomfort and saying like what is required um that I've just I've learned that from her and so we've been able to basically what might have taken me 6 months to confront might take me a week now to confront and so we just move so much faster through obstacles because
(32:07) before I would just put it off so number 16 is that uh networking matters if you have nothing to offer right don't sacrifice your goals in order to network because if you accomplish your goals this is the big one if you accomplish your goals you have even more to offer and the network will be there for you but the reverse isn't true because if you don't if you didn't accomplish the thing in order to network more go to these events and these these master minds and these things and and network and podcast and whatever the less successful you become the more you plateau the more irrelevant you become
(32:35) and the less the doors stay open for you and the more you have to hustle and grift and and shake hands and kiss babies and do all this business card handout [ __ ] but like the person who has the best network in the world is Rogan or Elon or Mr Beast like any of those people can call whoever they want up and they don't need to go attend networking event because here's the converse of that imagine they had sacrifi imagine Mr Beast for example or let's say Elon imagine Elon had sacrificed the goals that he had for the
(33:01) business so that he could attend more networking events and take more meetings and hey got a second hey can I pick your brains hey um like hey do hop on this podcast with me even though it doesn't really make sense just because someone asks for your time doesn't mean you owe it to them just because someone sends you a message doesn't mean you owe them a response and this took me a very long time to learn Lea's been so much better about that she's so good at saying no that we practice it I'll even tell you like we don't really do like New Year's resolutions or anything like that but one thing that we committed to this year
(33:28) was um social obligations or not obligations if we want to go we will go and if we don't want to go we will not go and if they no longer want to be friends with us that's fine because if we didn't want to go anyways and they stop inviting us great Real Talk play it out well then it's like well they might say bad things about us so does everyone else everyone else you pass have bad things to say about you it's just part of life number 17 you cannot be CEO of more than one thing no matter how much you want to or how good
(33:57) the opportunity is saying no to everything means saying yes to the one thing that matters and so in another video I basically talk through the biggest mistakes I made in my life and one of the recurring themes that happened before Lila and even as ashamed as I'm to say this even with Lila um being with me is that I I would steamroll her in the earlier parts of our career before I respected her opinion as much as I do now um where she's like don't you feel like we have enough going on that we shouldn't take
(34:21) off you know take a take a bite at this other thing and I'd be like no we got it we can handle it um and I was wrong and so I want to be really clear about something because I think there's a lot of confusion about this kind of in my audience I own equity in a lot of companies that is very different from being CEO or operator in a lot of companies at an extreme example if you buy stock in 10 companies on on the stock exchange you are an owner of all those companies you do not operate any of them ownership is very different from operating in my opinion you can only operate one thing very well if you
(34:53) operate two you operate them at a huge decrement so I'll give you an example here if you can run two $1 million businesses by being CEO of both you have the potential to run a $10 million business if you only picked one there's a Hu it's not one plus one and then it's really $2 million business it's really like you have five times the output if you just focus because the thing is is all of the wins come from the depth and the Nuance it comes from the the outsize Returns come at the very end of the race that's where you make the smallest individual improvements but you get the
(35:22) biggest returns from it and so a simple example is the difference between gold medal and silver medal in the Olympics is a fraction of a second but the difference between gold and silver in real life implications is everything you're either the best in the world or you're not and who knows who the bronze medalist was last year no one knows but everyone knows who us bolt is so there's huge increment incr there's huge real life returns for getting this little bit better that all of the focus centralized
(35:54) on one thing gets you that you lose out on because and the thing is is that because of your own ignorance because you you're not close enough you can't see the opportunities that you can't see they are unknown unknowns from an opportunity perspective that you only become aware of if you cut off one of you know another saying is killing your babies like you have to kill one of your babies so that you can let the other one grow up and so I have been the king of wanting to keep all my children alive but the amount of money that I made after cutting out all of these side
(36:26) projects and these side hustles and these gigs and these weird Partnerships like all of that happened in the first year of Lea and I being together because she was like dude I think you could do so much more if you could actually focus and like I tell these stories because I I was that person and so I was like if you were struggling with this stuff I get it I'm not like like like I did this and I [ __ ] up and I'm trying to help you not [ __ ] up and get there faster I had a chiropractor agency I had a dental
(36:54) agency I had my gym launch business where I was flying around in person doing launches I still owned my gyms from back home five of them five of those are individual businesses I had 1 2 3 had eight businesses that I was CEO of all of them and it was horrible this is when I lost everything this is when I had a DUI head-on collision this is when my mother went to the hospital also a terrible thing my grandfather died who I was really close with all of those things happened in like a six-month window and Leila to5 was like what are
(37:25) you most afraid of right now and I was like I'm afraid of having this hard conversation with these partners because I don't think I should be in these Partnerships anymore she's like well they're not going to end themselves and I'll be really honest with you the only way that I was really able to do it was I got in my head on collision in the DUI and I had a coach who told me um they're like your stress is going to kill you just said that like you got out alive so what are you going to do now and so I basically had to face my own death or morality or just getting out of life
(37:58) like I had got a head- on collision 60 MPH and I walked away like nothing like I just walked out of the car and um it wasn't with another thing it was with an it was a stopped object everything's fine um and after that and realizing that I could have just been dead because of how stressed I was um I just ripped the Band-Aid off of everything I like in a row I did it in one day I just called the first one up and I was like hey can't do this anymore like what do you mean I was like can't do this anymore not going to do the partnership and the second piece of advice that I was given
(38:33) if you have to exit some of these hard things um was do right by everyone he's like exit everything and do right by everyone he's like because if you if you screw one person over you will regret it forever and so that means all stakeholders that meant employees that meant customers that meant landlords that meant every Partners everything and so it was an excruciating process for me I had to write checks over and over again to refunds and partners and buyouts and vendor contracts I had signed and Lease agreements that I was on the hook for I mean everything I just had to it just like it just killed me
(39:09) but I just had this big thing which was like the alternative to this is I die and so I hope that you don't have as extreme of a circumstance but I only say this because I understand how hard it can be and I fortunate or not had a near-death experience which then made everything shrink comparison in terms of how important it seemed to me I had a business owner friend that I know who was doing 10 million bucks a year and he had like 17 businesses and he was running all of them and it was absolute Insanity I was like how many business you he didn't even know he had to pull up Excel sheet I was like this is
(39:42) absolute craziness and so I said which one's the best one he was like this one I was like okay hypothetical for you I said if the only thing you had to do in your life was double this business and you had no other businesses to care take care of do you think you could do it he's like oh my God it' be a [ __ ] Breeze I'd be able to do that in my sleep and I was like so why don't you guy spent the next year getting rid of all of his extra companies and that one company has grown and so the thing is just like we want to not leave money on the table we want to take the short-term wins but whenever
(40:21) you take those you actually take away from the big pot of gold which is the main focus that you started to go after to begin with and so I am am more guilty of this than just about anyone I can I don't know of anyone who's been worse about this than me and so I just say this because like my income and my net worth skyrocketed directly proportional to my ability to say no before I met Lea I couldn't crack $3 million a year I had lots of different businesses I had a ton of stress um and I had a lot of bad Partnerships not bad Partners mostly bad
(40:52) structures because I didn't know about her and when she came in and I watched how she worked and I watched how she dealt with people and I watched how she operated a business I learned so much and 24 months later I took home $17 million in personal income so I went from not cracking 3 million in Revenue to taking home 17 in income that was the difference that those lessons and watching her operate taught me and if all of these stories of all the things that I learned from Leila have been helpful I have a separate video where I break down how I lost over $100 million
(41:23) in 11 different mistakes that I made in my life and exactly what you can do to avoid them and likely you might be actively making one of those mistakes right now and I hope you don't so watch the video

(00:46) food right now and I'm going to slowly bring it down from here cuz I mean for you to keep winning it's like you don't need more size right I have a little room do you ever year like 2 lbs okay and I can always like be leaner and I keep putting on and I keep making weight so yeah we just keep it working Jesus I could have warned youall now it's a counterbalance for Russian lro okay come on deep breath use your breath come on keep going yep woo easy came out the top of there it's counterintuitive that once you succeed at bodybuilding everything
(01:39) comes with this success of bodybuilding prevents you from succeeding in bodybuilding yeah feel like speaking and guest posing yeah like traveling podcasts whatever and not wanting to wait till you retire to start a business and all this [ __ ] well I don't think you should no like starting a business when you when you retire is like no one cares anymore we definitely Force grow WE Post we do 450 posts a week how often do you film that every day no it used so we used to it's like it's changed over time before in the very beginning it was once every 90 days every one full day really
(02:13) and we do like a 100 clotes just that was it yeah and then it switched to every other week and then it became Fridays and then now I was like you know I think I'm better if I'm fresher and I do few or more yeah and so that's what or something like in the moment it's exactly what it is basically D message to me is like we're ready if you feel like stepping away at any time so I'm doing my [ __ ] in the morning if I like lightning strikes I go down and I talk wasn't as tough of mind I got to ask done any seminars in there was no one in the crowd and filmed it yeah yeah no I
(02:45) did cuz we why the team there but like had this Theory I do better live at live things than I do in front of the camera just more you know interesting and so I was like can I approximate that so then we did the whole setup we did the presentations the stage and then they s my teens out in the audience and I gave the presentation but it it's not the same you're not talking to empty chairs but there's still it still mostly empty chairs like teams can't fill a r yeah we opted out of doing that we did it like four times and then doing it yeah and so then I started
(03:17) doing Instagram lives and that was way more like fun yeah also cuz it's like the room's got 2,000 people in it or whatever you know so that's nice I mean if you can present in front of a [ __ ] empty chair that's harder than a crowd so yeah right just the on light yeah I had this tweet that went kind of viral it's like if you're like 16 to 25 like just get in shape yeah like cuz once you're in shape you can stay in shape but like you have the time and you'll get different priorities later yeah so it's like just do it then you have all the F yeah I'm grateful that I I I was obsessed from 15 I start I was 14 until
(03:54) I stopped Compu 25 it was right around when I started my I was 23 but I guess I start I stopped Compu 23 when you're 23 yeah when it stopped got my state record I think not National fair enough there's 50 states I think 23 when I dropped no 22 is when I dropped at a university and that's when I started doing it full-time were you uh like a junior or senior side I there for four years but on my second year of school so you you lived but I was Jack you're that's all it matters which in your actual life that is all that matter exactly it paid off yeah what do you think you to do lift weights for a living you're like actually yes
(04:32) that sounds great yeah I literally would spend 4 hours in the weight room and then like be in the cafeteria all day right that life right yeah are you the only member of raw Athletic Club no this is our public gym oh is it we just opened it like 6 weeks ago it's a Tas Shore Warehouse where your private gym is no my private gyms away from there this is in Nashville Florida it's in Florida where our partners is in Nashville with carbon culture maybe that's what we oh no no car culture yeah yeah I worked out the gym yeah he do some of the formulation
(05:05) stuff he's actually our partner in the in the business he used to own the manufacturer and then we partnered with them and we got pricing and help on our payment plan and all the [ __ ] yeah cuz I knew he did that I remember I got connected his location operator when I went in knew who I was he was like you should talk to our owner and I was like I you know whatever he's like no he's you know blah blah so I was like fine so I think we had a phone call or something yeah yeah he's a really good guy he's SM yeah I know he sounded that way because I was when I was getting in the supplement business he quoted us uh for
(05:36) manufacturing oh yeah yeah he was one of the I think he's the final three bits we going another company but probably should have gone with him all right bulgarians yeah so we've got uh I've got this thing you got a proper pad I do have a proper pad fancy I usually set up next to this pole here just have them in the balance on use a dumbbell or um I yeah usually I just grab a dumbbell how do you do it yeah but I just never held on something oh well that's how you cheat that's how you do it exactly here I'm going to put a little bit of music on cuz we have a sound system he silence well that's kind
(06:12) of nice hearing you [Music] pant now I'm going to try it out see you're my inspiration sorry you're my inspiration good like what motivates you and I'll just be like this guy right here this assle comes in my gym and looks more than me yeah that's a motivation it [Music] is I used to really like uh barbes like they used to tear my glutes up more than anything back when I had glutes they're great walking leses are [ __ ] incredible for leg grow you can load them you're such a [ __ ] to do like I left this whole Corridor empty for that yeah for walking away just cuz Lea
(07:05) doesn't cuz Lea's hardcore two play walking lunges yeah that's the biggest I did 225 225 I was when I was strong and young and and that's I was eating 6,000 calories a day I just was like I read this thing it was like insulin's the most anabolic hormone and I was like done and so more food it was the little that I met she used to make me a box of pancakes for breakfast it was a cake I do half a thing of syrup and I'd pass out again and then I wake up I'd work out I'd have a 1200 calor Shake then I'd
(07:39) have a burrito double meat double rice sour cream chips on the side guac and then I'd get back home for dinner and I'd have one box of pasta and one jar of tomato sauce that's cuz a box pasta is 70 gr of protein yeah I eat pasta a lot I digest it great yeah me too and rice I do really well with bosmal rice I could just eat unlimited amounts can you still eat like that no I can talk about though yeah I eat like out like I go to like a nice restaurant I have a steak and then like chips and something and I'm like oh
(08:09) my stomach all right you want to do side backs oh oh o starting to feel it like gluteous yeah I haven't done those in the long pan with the spit squat yeah so usually when I do my warmup I'll do this guy this yeah not for this I mean I'm more but I'll do that guy and I'll do that the hip flexor one like multi down GL I actually do this up like up yeah but I think I needed a Mobility stuff more than the shr honey you probably could argue that if you took 20 minutes out of your workout and put that into
(08:44) like constructive Mobility you'd be better off well I mean I did way more weight than I normally do so yeah that alone yeah literally today especially so I put um I put one rule for the whole gym is that this machine keeps four plates out oh you want five yeah I think so [Music] so do we plan on leaving this building or is this like home this is for the next 3 to5 3 to five I like Vegas a lot more than I think I've liked any City I've lived in as an adult it's just like it's a non-judgmental city everyone pretends to be something and they come to Vegas and they like let their real
(09:37) selves out yeah and I just like being here and so also it's not political cuz it's for tourism so it has to be just neutral so it's not political at all try like it's great for traveling in and out everybody I know comes to Vegas once year anyways so I can see honey pill if I lived in Cincinnati I wouldn't never see you right so I get to like I benefit from those we have direct flight everywhere out 4 hours from the beach in the mountains yeah 30 minutes on the lake we've got the best student dining and shows in the world it's
(10:07) taxfree it's dry which I personally like UFC's here it's their old building I mean it's a perfect setup for this yeah t you don't need like warehouse space too no have to deal with that [ __ ] right nice [Music] nice those a little quar oh yeah just your time under tension is crav cuz you can't skip for the weak Parts it's like that is the weak part right yeah well yeah it's interesting cuz now you have this B of like I want to push but like the risk reward of pushing goes down a lot literally cuz like you really just want to maintain on as little effort as possible or little risk as possible it's hard especially
(11:12) because they added weight cap to everybody in my weight my category except me I got like 2 lb and everyone else got 6 to8 why just because I was unfair people were complaining that people at the height of 61 had an unfair Advantage like statistically or something like no people were just complaining I was the only one in that category so that happened and then now everyone got better so I actually have to improve and like fine tuna but I'm also like the most old broken guy in the category so I also have to be the safest yeah what is interesting from like an investor perspective it's like Risk adjusted
(11:48) return yeah like the same thing yeah if you're at fifth place you should take all the risks you can because if you fail you lost nothing cuz no one cares lit if you win it makes all the difference exctly I've always found it so interesting with repeat Champions uhhuh like and most of them are like I mean Michael Jon's content but he's not happy he's a miserable [ __ ] he just found some way to continuously drive his way in a miserable fashion yeah and people look up to that and they want to be that and I'm like he didn't
(12:16) do it right yeah well he did but he didn't right it's just like my goal is my goal rather be happy and have peace of mind rather than yeah and I think and I think if you asked MJ would you rather piece of mind or seventh ring you'd say a seventh [ __ ] ring oh yeah so I think you Ronnie Coleman would you rather be able to walk or have nine ttles you'd say nine ttles yeah and that's where like you zoom all the way out and it's like making a judgment on anyone else's goals in general is stupid because their goals aren't the same George yeah so I would do it different no [ __ ] you're different like I had
(12:47) somebody a family member tell me they were like I would never live my life like you and I was like no [ __ ] and I would never live my life like you which is why you have your life and I live my life and good thing is you don't have to live mine and I don't to live yours it's interesting about how you define champion too like I had to think about it like a year ago I was like do I want to be the richest man in the world and I was like no I don't think that's my goal so then I was going to ask you that well
(13:12) you're talking about different objectives what is yours honestly I want to is it just be rich as possible no no no it's not I see wealth as a measure of my personal growth yeah because I see entrepreneurship as the most quantitative path of personal adment it's more I want to be the richest man that outs to become come not the richest man in the world now if that happens to become the richest man in the world cool I'm not against it yeah but me measuring my wealth against other people's is not the right game for me yeah but me measuring my wealth against what I believe I can create is a game that I
(13:47) can compete in and will always try to compete and so me seeing like a really hard thing for me was when we sold gym launch my monthly cash flow cuz I was an owner went to zero and I was like that's a mind [ __ ] yeah so I was like all of a sudden even though I had a bunch of cash in the bank account I felt poorer so I was like okay this is weird ooh and so I had to like re-calibrate and that's so I had this year where I started making content about like the meaning of money and like all this stuff that's when I had to redefine like what where am I the most where do I grow the
(14:21) most I grow the most when I work hard on things worth doing and so then it was like how do I Orient my life in a way that I maximize the amount of hard work I do on things worth doing and then once I saw what those days looked like I had a mentor of mine my first boss ever I'd have like a really good week and I was like that was like probably one of the best weeks I've had in my life and she was like not a profound person she was like I'm pretty sure the secret of life is living as many of those days in a row
(14:46) as you can't yeah and she and it was such a tactical like I was like so that's what I'll do I'll I think what are the days that I do my best and how do I live that day as many times in a row as I can and that's pretty much just the path I've been on stuff that has occurred has occurred but that's at least how I think about it and your path of feeling like best days are wealth building for our personal wealth building not like for yourself but your own goals it's usually me creating stuff and so like my arc happens to be
(15:15) business related so like I draw like my books are picture Buzz I draw pics about business I write books about business I make videos about business I make podcasts about business like it's just all I think about and so like if I happen to do that about like electric cars no one would care they'd be like oh he's passionate about it it's sh that I happen to be passionate about something that makes money yeah but it's all I think about I almost am more interested in business than I am doing business like my days I only do do business
(15:43) hardcore 1 to two days a week the rest of my days are making things that help other people do business so like me like doing this is this doing business I mean we make media yeah you know but like also me working out with people that I care about that I enjoy is on my list of things that I do on my best days you enjoy yeah and so I respect that I feel like a lot of people now are almost like they there just so many opinions out there of like what's right to the world rather than to themselves like you said
(16:12) when what's Like A Champion I had this thing when I was young I said I always talk about Champion mentality and had no idea what it meant and I began to Define it and now I need to consistently reiterate that it's my definition of what a champion is what is a champion to me is that the true only thing that a champion does is they make their own rules because they don't give a [ __ ] with people think they just do whatever they want I agree doesn't mean I'm winning doesn't mean nothing it just means I'm doing whatever the [ __ ] I want and I'm doing it the best I can and so
(16:35) like for example if they Chang the rules of the game for you that in order to win you had to I don't know [ __ ] kill your liver something no I'm just you whatever then you would have to make the decision do I want to win by the a rules or do I wi my mind exactly and I would leave right that's I think that is the difference between a champion who wins for the approval and a champion who wins for themselves yeah is that if they change the rules if your vision of what a champion is no longer aligns with the third party approval then you don't do it you don't play and I think there's a lot of wisdom
(17:09) in choosing what games to play for sure not feeling like you have to I never want to feel like I have to oh dude my number one rule in life like I'll do everything in the world to not have to do anything so fun story about cabs so you don't know this about me but I trained cabs every single day for more than 10 years and I developed 1090 is in my foot from doing so many set of Cales so I did seven sets of 20 and then your Cal's shown no my Cals are still fine but they were uh they were I had a girl that I did it was like why don't you train your cabs and I was like I [ __ ]
(17:42) train them all the times and so that I went from 3 days a week doing them at the end to doing them seven sets at the beginning as in my cabs but this I haven't trained cabs right now like me doing this with you this the first time I've trained cabs in like probably a year really like literally haven't done any reps and it was because I got 10 I I like I I was struggling walking cuz there was some muscle in like the base of my foot it's like under my big toe but I'll do this cuz I had the champ in town so of course maybe now you'll stretch and train Cavs again yeah all I have to do is I have to stretch my CS
(18:19) [Music] out oh [ __ ] this is a really good cap machine so so that's the thing is like I hate the load but I love the way this the lever is perfect so you don't have to put a lot on it either nice the range of motion moves so much yeah my calvs are going to be crippled just for doing like three sets they're going to be [ __ ] smoked yeah if you don't train Cals they get [ __ ] oh you're destroyed yeah the donkey calf over there is what Built My cabs and um standing single leg off a box is his body weight yep yeah I started doing um I did
(18:57) them years ago is one of the things that like broke through my C like growing it's just funny is like I um I I don't train chest anything Asos that last time because I just always had a decent enough chest but like if someone like doesn't know how to grow cabs I'm like I can [ __ ] tell you how to grow cabs the biggest thing was super deep you already know this but like super deep stretch yeah and so what I would do is I'd do like 20 or 30 reps body weight on one one leg off a box underneath of a pull-up bar and then once I reached failure I would start counting and so then I would do assisted negatives or
(19:26) like you know assisted positives and like the level of pain that like of like cooling yourself to the full Flex yeah when you're just lower oh yeah and then you like let it down and then you you really make sure that you get that last little that last little bit I was like I did it with clients once and I because I had just discovered this technique for myself and I like could barely walk and I did it with these ladies who I was training they came in on so it was like Friday they came on a Monday and they were like they like couldn't they're like I couldn't go to the dance this
(19:56) weekend because I couldn't put heels on they're like literally could not walk like and so I felt accomplished job well done yeah I felt like I did something yeah [ __ ] just like control negative yeah are such a secret to making anything grow I'll do those like I'll go up with two feet yeah and then lift one foot and then lower down like same concept yeah somebody gave me a cue that was trying to get your shoelaces perpendicular just like your foot just cuz you're there like perpendicular like like it you can't really do it but like maybe baller but
(20:29) like it's like so how's being a dad dude it's good it's chaos it's good it's chaos it's up body right good for SLE horrible for bodybuilding but now we've got help at night now which is like oh good the biggest cheat code man like my wife is a saint so she handles like the the hard part of all they not competing anymore no she stopped in 2016 she won the Olympia in 2016 that she kind has some health issues and then just so your kids are a champion breeding stck yeah they are that way used to be Lea got LIF at 315 for reps in the midd gym so I'm just you know I'm just putting it out there yeah
(21:06) you good on this do one more you're do one more I'm going to my CS are going I already know they're going to be cook all right don't worry Daniel I know you wanted the shop there's the shot still got it I'll give give you a lefty or you not anymore I have 10 to 9s in my [ __ ] toe now the old man excuse the old man I'm going to do the hit thing cuz I that was the first time I've done legs in a while that I was not with no pain y cuz I do my warmup to get to like a two out of 10 pain I'm like whatever yeah but that was like a one out of 10
(21:40) like I had some but like how many warm-up sets you normally do of the actual I just recently started doing like three proper the A and that helped a lot yeah I was just going straight and I was like this is horrible yeah that's brutal I feel like it was like my muscles are just tearing off like just not horable yeah no there's like a lot of actual science behind you even just your nervous system turning on with proper warmups and everything your muscles are literally aren't even activating until then yeah they're yeah
(22:04) they're just like what's going on yeah please don't do this nice okay oh [ __ ] easy this is such we it's the best cap machine ever used dude it's good this one's sweet because you can have the full stack this this is where I I built this and the and standing uh single leg are the two things that like Built My CS but like this guy like all the way up and just like yeah who makes this this is nebula nebula yeah where' you find this hard to find I us have all these dealers that I have like on speed dial they like kind of serious I don't I
(22:52) like the way this feels and also feels really good gives you a crazy stretch CU they bent over yeah yeah it's one of those ones where when you put weight on it like is even better kind of thing you do 400 lb am weight on top I did when I was at my Peak you're a big boy yeah when I was a big boy yeah yeah I had this 100 lb plate that I had but I haven't done cads in year so we'll see see what my C drink can still like probably [Music] bad Kevin's going to make a maelly motivation video of you [Music] nice yeah yeah that's where I like smoke those yeah this also goes up too so you
(23:42) can adjust uh this yeah so you can go up a little higher for cuz I was on lless setting come I'm good like that yeah but know I like I mean it's a big piece but um I TR I I mean I train on this every day for a real time that and the single Lake are the two things that I did for my C did you have all this somewhere else before you moved here yeah my my house in Austin I had had I had like half the I had everything I about half these pieces do you want to do something else my legs are cooked but I can do whatever I'm with the champ so I mean we
(24:12) can do a little quick quens all today okay unless you're cooked cook no I can do like zero rest back and forth mhm [Music] people are like you're taller than I expected so thanks Cuz um Trevor you Dr cash you near him anyways no he's like you have sh eye proportions he's like so on camera he's like you look like you're five five yeah so my my legs are actually super short which is good for like leg moves like I have super short femur really long torsa are they good for squatting yeah did you pull Sumo or
(25:08) conventional Sumo oh God this guy I pull conventional t on my back and that switched to Sumo then I hurt my hips yeah I was 100 lbs weaker on Sumo than conventional I could do so much more volume on Sumo yeah and so that kind of made up for it but weirdly my deadlift made its biggest gains this is going to sound insane doing one set of 20 a week like your one R Max did cuz I did the same I did like the [ __ ] pyop pin chart and you know like 531 like I did all of the low rep like three sets of four all the tradition and
(25:49) like my deadlift didn't move for like 3 years and I was like I was like competing and like carage I was like so upset about it and so then I was like [ __ ] it and so jug I don't know if you know jug or not GT jts Chad Wesley Smith okay well he was the power lifting world yeah yeah so he was yeah he was being in the power lifting worlds like football training and stuff and so we had this thing called The Jug jug method this is like 10 years ago and it was all this super high rep stuff he basically took
(26:14) wendler's 531 which is a parallel thing program and just like tripled the bullet so instead of like sets of 53 and one it was sets of like 201 151 yeah but like am wraps I basically ignored everything in the program but the deadlifts was like 20s and I was like well I'll do that I'll see how that goes and I just I just did sets of 20 and I added 10 lb a week and I did it for like 16 weeks and added like 160 lb to my 20 and I was like so did your W Max go up too though oh yeah well I mean I'm guessing cuz I was close to my one rep max on my 2 R Max by the true yeah yeah
(26:51) so hopefully yeah so like the end of it I did like I think I did I have a video of doing like 465 for 20 Jesus and then I was like this is stupid that's enough oh yeah and this is when I was eating like the 6,000 calories a day thing the burritos oh dude I was like you know Milos is the one who said like there's no such thing as overtraining only undereating and like I say as a natural guy who did that um I feel like I can kind of attest to it like I drink a lot of volum how old were you 25 yeah I mean I feel like when you're 25 and under around there you can do
(27:25) whatever you want I I at the gym I was a gym owner I lift the gym yeah and I trained that was all I did I ate and I trained that's literally all I did when I was doing that it was eight hours a day of food and training yeah I've decreased my loading increased my warm up everything more like proper and I'm just in more pain out you said you do more warm up less volume and you're in more pain is I that sounds right yeah so that's what I was doing I did the 20 rep sets for deadlift and I was doing uh three sets of 20 on Squat and I got up to 45 for 20
(28:01) well barell back squats we're squatting we're squatting I was I was 235 natural that's big I mean that's a [ __ ] for natural that's a lot of [ __ ] R um and uh and then um I benched so bench has been my biggest natural LIF like built a bench every time I touch the bench it blows up and so I don't bench which is why I into it but for the six I only did it for 6 weeks I put 35 lbs on naturally I the pictures musle what was your 20 rep max for bench so I hadn't benched in like a year or two yeah but I did it for this little cycle and so I was doing
(28:35) seven sets of everything seven sets of bench seven sets of not deadlift and squat but seven sets of rows leg presses I did banded leg press seven sets of 20 yeah that's how I grew I was I started as 245 for seven sets of 5 and 6 weeks later I benched uh 3.
(28:57) 95 for one and I had never like I didn't put a yeah anything on there so like I think the week of I did like 335 for 7 sets of five like six weeks yeah but but I like I cuz I only had that in that one lift and then I just know that there are guys who have that on all their lifts it's just like that's my worst lift so it's your bench that is that horrible bench my one rep max ever was 415 you were probably bodybuilding bench right I was like power of thing benching which is 6 in so when you train I mean do you do you have programming that you follow this year is the first year I had ever follow in a program I love that like that confir like it's so
(29:40) confirming I mean you know it in your field there's an art to being good yeah and you it's you if you think you need to follow a perfect program yeah if someone took everything I did orever someone have took everything you did and did it again even if you did it that you were following a plan instead of just doing it naturally you wouldn't be here yeah it's really interesting because the hardest thing to develop is intuition it's like how can like when when you're like I got it today I'm going to I'm going to gas it like can someone teach you that I don't know I
(30:10) mean I definitely know like for work I have seasons where like I gas it you know what I mean where I'm like I'm working 16 hours I'm taking every stimulate I know of and like and I'm like not getting as much sleep as I should but I can just keep pushing and then there's some days where I like wake up and I'm like no not today night today yeah and so I I was I was I put it on my my profile was like I don't have like I work like weekday weekends are all the same for me so basically I wake up if I feel good I
(30:42) work and if I wake up and I feel like [ __ ] I change this the nature of the work I do yeah so it's like if I don't feel good I'll play more meetings I'll take more calls cuz I'm not like I'm not going to be doing deep work yeah but if I wake up and I'm like dude I could cure cancer today then I'm like all right let me write a book chapter like let me script out like a a a presentation or something that's like really deep and I'll just tell the team like cancel some of my calls or move them like I'm going to be in the zone today yeah but I also Imagine over time whether consciously
(31:14) subconsciously you know that like when you wake up on those shitty days doing certain things that you can at least do uhhuh at the right capacity will put you back into a place where you feel good to oh [ __ ] where most people are like I'm going to take the day off I don't feel good and then next thing you know it's been a year and they've taken the whole year what's up Julio I'm glad you came for legs cuz legs is what like I can push on upper body but like I hesitated I was like I want to ask someone to train legs with me and I was like yeah [ __ ] it we I'll trade with you I got the Hotpot
(31:45) okay you guys know seum he was TI it on so with some of the drinks the seum Ks are his his uh and then you get this probably even more than I do but like the generic hey big guy like hey Jim that way or whatever the [ __ ] no matter what someone says and you know half the time it's some sort of left-handed compliment or whatever I just say like just trying to catch up to you bro and so it doesn't matter what they but like I've had so many people who like said something meane and I'm like she trying to catch up to you bro and then they're like ah
(32:14) Fu I was being dick you know and that that's always been my my big counter yeah for some reason I always get people like are you like that se bum guy and my response is just no but I get that all the time and then like probably % the time people are like oh and then I just walk away that's it I'm also equally awkward and antisocial so if someone comes up and like do I know you're from somewhere I'm like I don't know probably not and then I just leave not from somewhere so training wise you just Train by feel and you just consistently out waight when you can I have a program now well every year but until now I was
(32:49) pretty like consistent in what I would do and movement I just knew in my brain yeah I know like my top movements when I start if it's incline chest dumbbell press it's if it's pendulum squat if it's de Ben over Rose I'm like last year did this much so I'm going to do this much this week yeah and youed work to like I'm going to add 20 lbs to it or 30 lbs or it was for a while it was like all right I'm going to do this for six and then I got eight and I got 10 I'll put a 25 on I'm back down to six and eight and then 10 all the stuff that I know is like stick to a handful of lifts
(33:17) don't do a lot of variation slowly i' progress it you know reps or weight right but then like I just noticed that I had less motivation to train and so like I was more prone to skip days and things like that yeah and like this was today was harder than I would normally train my legs so I'll probably like it'll probably [ __ ] my like I'm supposed to train legs tomorrow yeah so I just like I'll probably if you train L tomorrow I'd be impressed yeah yeah so I'll just like I'll skip that and maybe I'll skip a second like cuz it's every other day so I would have trained Lakes tomorrow and two days from there so I'll probably just skip the
(33:47) next two and then hit it again like if you don't have that flexibility like if you were in town like oh I'm falling like why bother like you what I mean like I've had people there's like three you know Fitness dudes who have you know whatever they were in town I saw this kid who's like not a competitor he was like I'm following a program and so all the dudes were lifting all the big guys are lifting together throwing weights R and he's like sitting Indian style ins side like I'm following it's like dude you're missing the point yeah like
(34:12) you're not going to get be like 40 and be like man I'm really glad I followed that progress I was 22 and you know training with those guys and then going home being fired up about training with them what result till your list going up more too right the motivation you get from that would be more oh so much more yeah like and in the memory and like all the positive experience that come from it did you listen to music when you train yeah what do you listen to it varies alternative rock Eminem Kanye West 9s hip hop yeah I listen to more or less the same stuff I'm not a music person it's the only time I listen to
(34:41) music is when I train yeah and so I like so bad that a friend of mine from high school gave me this CD it was rap CD 1 through six and I uploaded it on my iPod and then like I went through all of college and then we were hanging out a couple years later he's like so what you you know what do you listen to now on your train I was like the N that you made me and he was like the what and I was like yeah the one that you made me he was like in high school and I was like yeah rap CD 1 through six I still listen to he's like dear God he's like dude there's been things that have Haden he's like Eminem's had two CDs since then I'll
(35:12) make you a new mix and SPO out by then you just still have an iPod like I've got a zoon yeah I didn't even have one of those yeah it's weird because now I'm turning to 35 in like a couple months in August and I was like I am like like when I it before I turned 30 I was like young and successful and now I'm just a white dude yeah I felt that too I was like holy [ __ ] you're only 25 and you won the Olympia now you're like all right you're the old guy now yeah you're just yeah it's I'm just a guy yeah what's
(35:43) interesting with um like with the Olympia in terms of like competitive landscape and whatnot is that like in the game of business everyone is a competitor like everyone's in the game it's just some people don't know it and that's what I find kind of interesting about like the business world is like you compete against the world and it's Global yeah and you compe against guys they 90 and like like kind like you can't age out how old was Kendall Jenner she be she became the youngest self-made billionaire and then they revoked it they did like she wasn't actually or
(36:13) yeah the numbers weren't what she overstated some of her numbers like 9 months later after she got into all of the pr after I had gone into a deep 7-Day depression because of how inadequate I felt as a result of compared to this little w yeah no I mean it was actually like it was actually weirdly it was a it was a it was a career defining moment for me really it sounds ridiculous to say when I saw her on the cover fors a 19 years old as a billionaire I felt like a failure I I did I was I was 20 I think I was 26 or 27 can't remember it was and I
(36:45) I taken home $17 million in income that year and I was like I'm hot [ __ ] I'm [ __ ] cool and then it was just like 19-year-old girl billionaire I was just like I suck at everything and that was actually the moment where I was like she understand so I fundamentally think that if someone makes more money than me then they know something about business that I don't she was the one that got me on to brand was that she was able to make than me because she had a brand and I was like maybe there's something to this and I did I also encourage your philosophy to not compare to other
(37:17) people though H well to compete against yourself and all that so yeah yeah so there's a really good one there is that there's a difference between criticism and and uh insults so if you insult thought yourself and you make a judgment if you criticized you point out a discrepancy so she's bigger than I am in this way why that's criticism like I could do better judgment is and because of that you are bad yeah all right be easy my friend yes sir appreciate you gin appreciate you have a wonderful day guys [Music]

Transcript:
(00:00) So, this lawyer was losing $100,000 a year because his business model was broken. And so, what I want to walk through is how we fixed it, how you can apply the learnings from his business to your business. My name's Alexi. I run acquisition.com. It's a portfolio of companies uh that last year did over $250 million a year in aggregate.
(00:16) And we help businesses just like the one I'm going to walk you through today scale. So, let me give you the first rule that I have in terms of scaling a business. 111. One product, one avatar, one channel until you're at a million bucks a year. All right? So that means you sell one thing to one person in one way until you get to a million.
(00:33) The first issue was the help everyone issue. I don't think there's anything wrong with having this as a noble goal, but you're not going to help anybody if you're broke. You need resources. So the attorney launched courses and software to kind of give back. There were some financial consequences from that because the software itself alone was losing him money.
(00:51) And so he's spending the majority of his time on these two things. And guess where you think most of his money was coming from here? His services. Here's the reality of this is that every hour you were spending on the unprofitable work was an hour not spent on scaling the services which was the main cash cow of the business. Like it kills a ton of businesses.
(01:09) And the thing is they feel justified in this. Like they're they're doing the Lord's work, but you're not you're fooling yourself because you're not willing to confront the harder issue which is that you don't know how to focus and you don't know how to say no. And it also means you don't know how to say no to customers because you cannot sell everyone.
(01:25) Even if you give everything away for free, you'll have people who complain. So people complaining is going to be a constant in business. You might as well have them complain and be profitable and help the people who are swimming towards you. And this is actually pretty near and dear to me because when I met Ila, my wife, she was a trainer and she actually had this bleeding heart uh syndrome, if you will.
(01:42) And she was like, I just want to build a company where people really love working and I just want to help a lot of people. And I said, do you think it's possible that you will be able to help more people if you make money? and she thought about it for a while and she was like, "Yeah, I think so.
(01:55) " And so that was actually one of the first conversations we had on our first date um that led into all the things that we have today. And so this is what we did to solve problem number one. We killed the vampire. All right? Because right now they had something that was sucking up their cash flow and preventing them from scaling.
(02:10) Now he had this hope maybe I'll sell the software down the line. Dude, you're not going to sell the software. It's not good enough. You don't have any money. The people that you have working for you are unfocused. It's not going to work long term. No one's going to give you this multiple. Like this is the thing. People think like, "Oh, I put some code together.
(02:20) I'm going to have a 10x on my topline. If you think that, you're not going to get it. People who are actually in software are going allin and it's still incredibly hard. The second thing is we took the education business and I said, "Okay, well, what if we could use that to just drive more into the services?" So, we repositioned the very cheap education as free education and then that allows people to ascend themselves into the services.
(02:45) And so, this gives you a very powerful front end that gets spread from word of mouth. You can also advertise it, but ultimately we just know that that's going to drive more people into this community where he was teaching things. And then they're like, you know what, this sounds like a lot of work. I'd love to have you do it.
(02:57) And the third thing we did is that okay, if we've killed the vampire, we reposition the education to drive the services. What can we do with the services? Well, we want to double down. And so what does that actually mean? It means we had to repric the services because their close rate was exceptionally high.
(03:10) Again, the help everyone issue. They just wanted to say yes to every single person, but they weren't able to get nearly as much profit as they probably should have. And so in his business, I saw an easy double or triple for the right avatar. And so what happens is, let's say you've got, you know, you know, avatar A, avatar B, and avatar C.
(03:26) The thing is that an A client might be able to spend 10 times more than a C client. And so what most people do is they take A, B, and C, they average them and say, "Okay, well, I'm going to charge 2x rather than 10x." And they sacrifice their margin and ultimately how much they're able to scale. Because believe it or not, there's still a ton of A's.
(03:42) So just serve them first. The best customer you have. This is the ICP, the ideal customer profile. This is what we're doubling down on in the service. Let's find that one customer, that one avatar to sell our one product to on one channel. So, that's how we solve problem number one. Real quick, the reason for this ad is I'm throwing the entrepreneur event of the season, and you're invited.
(04:02) This is going to be my biggest book ever. No, not like that. This is going to be my biggest book. Well, not even like that. This is going to be my biggest book ever. Actually, not even like that. This is going to be my biggest book ever. 100 million Money Models. And I've been preparing to release this book to you for over two years.
(04:20) And at the launch event August 16th, I'm going to be showing you how to get more customers to spend more money with you in less time over and over again. It's the most valuable skill set I have. Now, on top of that, come check this out. I've got five mystery headliners that have all confirmed they're going to be there live, and they've never before shared the same stage, and most of these people don't speak publicly.
(04:37) Now, on top of that, I have four amazing bonuses that are available to anyone who wants to pre-order a book. You don't have to because you can register for free for that. You can show up for free. You can enjoy all of that for nothing. But if you want to pre-order a copy of the book, I got four bonuses for you. Now, on top of that, I've got one project that I've been working on for the last 2 years that I'll be unveiling live.
(04:55) And I can't tell you what it is, but I can tell you that it's better than an NFT. It's less than a Bitcoin, and every single person who shows up live gets one. So, if you want it, click register. I'll see you there live August 16th. Pre-order a book if you want. It's going to be awesome. So problem number two is they had broken traffic.
(05:17) So what does this mean? It means they had a leaky bucket, right? So when I asked him to walk me through how he was getting customers, he told me that he created content on YouTube. But when I asked him if that was where most of the leads were coming from, he said, "Actually, they go to his Instagram page from YouTube.
(05:30) " I was like, "Okay, so what are your calls to action in the video?" I was like, "Do you send them from your videos to Instagram?" He said, "No, they actually just randomly find me on Instagram and then they DM us on Instagram and ask us questions and that's ultimately how we get leads." I was like, "Okay, slow down. So, you're getting all your leads from a place that you don't tell them where to go and then when they get to that Instagram, which they find on accident, your profile doesn't even solicit them to DM you.
(05:54) " And he was like, "Yes." So, I was like, "Great. Well, let's solve that." Now, I make this as an extreme example, but I see this as a problem that a lot of business owners make, which is that like they don't know where the leads are coming from. And so, they continue to optimize for the wrong thing. They continue to stick with what's comfortable or what they know instead of adjusting based on their customers how they behave, right? And so, he was probably leaving 20, 30, $50,000 a month on the table just by not optimizing his
(06:21) traffic that he already was getting. So, we did five things to solve this problem. So number one is we added CTAs at the 30% mark in his YouTube videos to go to Instagram and DM him. The second is that we put that CTA in more places. So we also put it in the description. We also put it in the pinned comment.
(06:40) We also updated his YouTube profile to also have the same CTA. So B, C, and D are all the same concept. And then finally, here's the nasty one. We started proactively DMing people who are following him because he's doing way better on YouTube than he is on Instagram. And so most of those new follows are people who are coming from his YouTube.
(06:58) So we just said, "Okay, well, if someone follows you, DM them and just say,"Hey, you here for free stuff or do you want to help with your your legal stuff?" They say, "I want help." Then boom, you have a lead. If I'm a business owner, I'm thinking, "Okay, what can I take from this?" So we took someone's existing behavior.
(07:12) We weren't like, "Oh, let's drive them through funnel." People were already going to Instagram and DMing him. And he already knew how to convert from DM. So like, let's not break that. Let's lubricate it. The other piece that we did in terms of why this worked is that we were getting qualified leads up front.
(07:23) So, we started filtering them in the DMmers by saying free thing or help. And by doing that, it just got so much of the time wasted in the DMs off their plate. So, the third problem that we that we encountered was he had an hourly billing trap, right? He was billing the wrong way. They were charging $250 an hour and the average client value was 1,500 bucks.
(07:43) All right, so that's 6 hours on average. This, in my opinion, was leaving a lot on the table because people were actually coming to him not for hourly services. They were coming for a specific result. The issue here is that he actually was underpricing the result. And so trying to say, "Hey, we're $250 an hour.
(07:57) " Maybe that's a lot, maybe it's not a lot. No one no one has a really good idea of what an hourly rate should be unless they just look at other people's hourly rates, which makes you a commodity. Whereas, if you say, "Hey, you want your music to be able to be sold to a record label. I'll get all of the IP protection in place in order for you to do that.
(08:13) " Well, now I can position the price of my thing in relation to the dream outcome that they want, which is to become a music star and ultimately leverage that to become famous and, you know, save the world with their music. And so this underpricing trap is especially common with service providers who price based on time based on outcome.
(08:28) All right, you want to be value based, not kind of feature-based in terms of your pricing. So we ditched the hourly billing and we went with 5,800 upfront. Now that sounds you're like, "Holy cow, that's way bigger." Now remember, he had plenty of sales conversations that was able to generate and he had a pretty good close rate.
(08:45) And so if you have a really good close rate or an exceptionally good close rate, then I hear that and think, "Oh, we're underpriced." And so on top of this 5,800, we also tagged in a little commission that he gets if they close a deal. And some of these deals are worth several hundred,000. So it actually adds up to be uh pretty material for him.
(09:01) But also, I like adding that piece in because when you talk about flat fee plus performance, guess what you think the prospect is thinking? Oh, this is probably going to happen. So, we actually literally how we present our price will dictate the belief that a prospect is going to have based on what they will believe our incentive structure is.
(09:18) If he just said, "Hey, uh, I'm 100% commission." Then people be like, "Holy cow, that's an amazing offer." And a lot of people do that because it is such an amazing offer. But how can we dial this back to find the sweet spot? Because plenty of these musicians might not have been good and some of the clients that you might work with might not actually be successful.
(09:33) So, we have to balance our risk here. But still having an element of performance still drives that conviction. Now, what we did that I think is kind of clever, and this is my preferred way of doing things if I ever have the option, is having an AB offer. And so, you can AB anything, hint, it's coming out of my next book. I'm talking about this.
(09:49) But whenever you have an offer, if you say, "Would you like chocolate or vanilla? Do you want to start Monday or Tuesday? Do you want to have a male or female masseuse?" You can always AB your offer. All right? And so, the B offer that we made here was $25,000 with zero commission. Now, what is this offer? This offer is an anchor because now it makes the 5800 offer seem like a steal.
(10:09) So that was the main thing we did to break him out of the hour of billing. Now you might be like, "Well, he might not sell as many." Well, guess what we did earlier? We've got him a whole bunch more traffic and we got way more people to opt in and we already triaged to the best clients. See how this is all stacking together? So the fourth problem that came up is like, okay, he didn't have a sales process.
(10:24) Now, he was good at selling, but he didn't have any kind of process in place to make it a sales motion that is repeatable. And so if your conversions right now are hit or miss and you're not sure what's going on, it's usually because you're missing a sales flow. And so everything was happening ad hoc. So some leads came through Instagram, others booked random calls through Calendarly.
(10:40) And to be fair, I'm not hating on him. Like he, you know, he's doing a great job and it's small business. We're starting out. That's how it works, right? But if you're in the situation, you have a huge amount of opportunity here by just cleaning this stuff up. So the founder was actually treating every call like a legal consultation.
(10:56) And so he was actually charging the 250 for the call up front because it was an hour of his time, which for me I'm like, "Oh my god, we're missing out on so many opportunities because we haven't positioned this in any kind of valuable way. It's just like, hey, pay for an hour of my time and then I'll sell you more hours of my time." Not a fan.
(11:10) Instead, I'd rather qualify prospects upfront, have them watch a structured structured sales presentation, make sure that they are qualified for the product or service that we're trying to sell, then sell that thing all up front, and then provide the service. And so what this does is this actually matches to what a high intent lead how they actually want to buy.
(11:30) They want to know that you're legit. They want to know that you have a process. This isn't your first rodeo. And you demonstrate that even before you do your services. How someone is sold will dictate how legit they think you are. Here's what we implement inside the business to fix the sales motion. So number one is we put a VSSL that was 5 to seven minutes.
(11:44) If you don't know what that is, it's a video sales letter. All it is is basically explaining who, what, where, when, why. This is what we do. And then frequently asked questions. You don't need to over complicate this. A lot of people think that there's some big black box of magic that like only these super secret ninja, you know, marketers understand.
(11:59) You just answer the questions and the language that they present to you on sales calls. So, the normal question someone asks on calls about your products and your services, you take all those questions, you say it back to them in the video and say, "A lot of people ask this question. This is how we answer that.
(12:12) A lot of people ask this question. This is how we answer it." That's it. It's all we're doing. Again, it doesn't need to be super long, but it will help qualify customers and you will see a dramatic lift if you only do this. The rumors are true. My next book, $100 million Money Models, is coming out and I'm launching it at a live event.
(12:28) And at the event, which you can register for free, I'm going to show you how to do four things. One, get more customers to spend more money in less time with you over and over again. And the craziest thing of all is that I've been planning on a secret project for multiple years. And every single person who shows up live is going to get one.
(12:44) And I can't tell you what it is, but I can tell you that it's less than a Bitcoin and more than NFT. And every single person who shows up live gets one. But you got to be there live August 16th. I'll see you there. The second thing we did is we implement Bant and I do this in basically every single business that I advise which is budget, authority, need and timing.
(13:06) So this is actually originally from uh IBM in like the 60s and it has stuck. So do they have the money? Can they make the decision? Do they need this solution for them right now? And the right now is the timing piece. Are they willing to move forward today? And in terms of asking the question, we could just ask questions like, can you afford $5,800 in order to get your business, you know, incorporated, your IP protected.
(13:29) Is there anyone else who's involved in this decision? That's authority. What happens if you don't solve this need? When would you like to get this done or when would you like to start? And you give them a drop down like today, tomorrow, or you know, a few weeks from now. You want to sell by the way to people who say today or tomorrow.
(13:44) See, the next thing we did um is that we needed to fix this from a consultation to a sales call. All right, which means that we actually have to have a script. We have to clarify where they're there. Label them on the problem over their past experiences. Understand the gap between where they are where they want to go. We aggravate the pain.
(13:57) Make sure it's very clear what happens if they don't do it. And I'll give you the the simplest structure for this, which is plus minus minus plus minus minus plus. All right. So, what you show here is you say, hey, if you work with me, you get more good stuff. And if you work with me, you get less bad stuff.
(14:11) Cool. Now, if you don't work with me, you're going to get more bad stuff. And if you don't work with me, you're going to get less good stuff. And so that gives you four angles of persuasion that you can do in the sales consultation when you get to the S of the closer framework. So clarify, C, L, label them with a problem.
(14:26) O, overview the past experience. S, sell them the vacation. Here we go. E, explain away their concerns. Part of that's going to be covered in the VSSL. If they come back up, you overcome them the same way. And then R, reinforce the decision, which is once they ultimately buy. The next thing we do, which I'm not always a big fan of, but because he had so many unqualified customers, is having a downell that was basically hands-off and just said, "Hey, you can buy this thing for $2 to $3,000.
(14:49) " Rather than saying, "Buy it for, you know, $10 a month." Right? It's a different a different way of monetizing uh the do-it-yourself path. But I also like this as a downell because you're like, man, for only, you know, for if I'm 3K for this and I just pay an extra 2,800 bucks and I can have them do it and make sure it's right, I'd rather have them do it.
(15:06) So, we actually have anchors on both sides. So the downell is not that much less and the anchor is way higher. So it makes the best path or the best option the 5800 which is the core offer. When we put these pieces in place for the sales process, it creates a predictable system rather than relying on ad hoc or random chance.
(15:24) And the pre-qualification process makes sure that time is spent with the valuable prospects, the good people who've got the money to spend the the need to get solved, the authority to make the decision, they want to do it now. And the VSSL sets the expectations and a structured approach in the conversation allows for continuous improvement so that you can actually look at the the sales.
(15:41) You can listen to the recording. So you can add stuff to the VSSL, you can add to the script and you keep the optimization cycle going. And this is what makes sales repeatable, measurable, and ultimately scalable to a team rather than it just being a vague we talk to people sometimes approach, which is what the lot a lot of business owners do because you know it's worked for you so far.
(15:57) But the thing is is sometimes what's worked for you so far is not going to get you where you want to go. Come check this out real quick. So if you're listening to this and being like, "Wow, these are really specific instructions." Guess what? He was at stage four prioritize in the scaling roadmap. What was his constraint product? You said yes to anyone who would pay.
(16:12) Feedback from so many different customers creates too many different product directions. Does that sound familiar? It's because businesses behave in patterns. And the nice thing is that because they behave in patterns, they can also be solved with the same patterns. So what do you have to do? Specialized product.
(16:24) Do a V2 price to serve that new niche down avatar. That's what we did. Marketing. You had too many unqualified leads. So what do we do? Make better free stuff. the education and make more creative to boost volume. They already had enough creative, but he was leaking. Add qualification and friction.
(16:36) So, the extra volume self- selects. Doesn't this sound a lot like what we just did? Now, this isn't like a magic trick where I'm like, "Wait, I just reprint this for every one of these videos." No, it's like businesses behave in patterns. And so, if you're stuck right now and you would like to see what we do to help get people unstuck, you can go to acquisition.com/romap.
(16:51) We actually made this for ourselves as an internal assessment tool because I wanted to have a more tech- enabled service, but then I was like, you know what? Let's just make it free. And so that's what we did. All right. Now, if you would like our help doing this, kind of like what we did with this particular attorney, on the next page, you can book a call and our team will get to know you, get to know the business, and if it makes sense, invite you out in person to our headquarters where we can actually dig into the business and come up with
(17:12) the most personalized tactics that will ultimately help you scale the business the fastest. So, if that sounds interesting, click the link, get the free thing, and book a call. Otherwise, enjoy the rest of the video. So, the TLDDR is this. Keep the main thing the main thing, and cut what's not working. Second point, traffic is useless without a clear direction.
(17:28) Three, price based on value, not time. If you want to see the actual conversation that I had uh with this uh attorney, you can look at it over here. Enjoy.

How the Top 1% ACTUALLY Make Their Money - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wtsX7WHQMFM

Transcript:
(00:00) how do the top 0.1% in the world actually make more money than everyone else there's three layers let's start with layer one Global so if you zoom all the way out the top 1% of countries in the world do things differently than the rest of them and we can measure the productivity of a country by something called GDP which is gross domestic product per capita now the per capita part just means how much total production the economy does so just think Revenue think sales and then per capita is per person and so this allows us to Norm ize different countries that
(00:31) are big countries versus small countries and see how much the individual is making now the reason this is so important and why we start at layer one Global is because if you even out everything you will be able to see the strongest levers on wealth creation because they're just done in Aggregate and to be clear within each country of course there are some people that get way more of that slice of the pie than others but even at the global level there are some countries that get more of the slice of the pie than other countries and so for example the United States has the largest GDP in the world
(01:01) and tuvalu has the smallest now per capita it shifts around Luxembourg is actually the country in the world that has the highest GDP per person so 151,000 now I'll give you an example of number two which is Singapore they have the second highest GDP per capita and is also the home of uh Michael who's our media director uh and the reason they were able to do that is because they invest these countries in two major categories number one is education and number two is technology and so if you look at GDP P per capita for a country
(01:33) the increases can almost directly be tied by reinvestments in education and Technology Singapore has $148,000 in gross domestic product per capita now how do they have that well the entire culture in Singapore is flipped compared to say the United States teachers believe it or not there are actually seen as one of the most prestigious positions that you can hold and they are paid very well because the country understands that attracting good teachers is one of the ways to make the country more competitive long term and so if we think about this at a global
(02:08) level which I think is important is what are the inputs that every country has that's even the inputs are time and bodies and so at the very basic level someone anybody at all these countries at level zero can do menial labor which is basically things that have required no skill to do so if I had a conveyor belt of switchboards and I had to plug two things in another one comes in I plug two things in it's typically something that you can train someone to do in about five minutes and then you're just basically having them trade their time and doing this very simple task repetitively now that is typically not
(02:47) valued nearly as highly as other skills which is why countries will invest in technology and education the education so that they have more skills take technology to do three things technology does number one it allows you to do more of what you currently do so that switchboard person if there wasn't a conveyor Bel in front of them wouldn't be able to do nearly as many of those things as someone who did the second thing is that technology allows you to do what you can already do even better and so think of both of those in terms of units of time because remember this is one of the key inputs that everybody
(03:17) has that's even whether you're in the richest country in the world or the poorest country in the world every single person has the same 24 hours and yet some countries massively outcompete other ones just like some individuals in every individual economy massively outcome people within them which will peel back in Layer Two let's think about it like this if you have a brain and two hands then what allows you to do more with that brain in two hands well technology lowers the skill requirement to do anything right like if you had to figure out how to build a house but you
(03:48) couldn't use tools you'd have to have a tremendous amount of skills but all of a sudden if you have a saw and you have uh you know some Nails then you wouldn't have to figure out how to like break trees and interlock them and do all sorts of craziness right that's at a very basic level but on top of that it allows you to do more of what you're already doing so that means you're doing more per unit of time remember everything's going to be traced back to time or you do higher quality which also is traced back to time because maybe you it would take you a longer period of time to make something that good or would just simply be impossible right
(04:19) which is why it's such an advantage that in the early days of smartphones and I don't even know if they still do this anymore but you're not allowed to use a Smartphone when you take tests because it's such an advantage that it shifts the whole curve which I think by the way they should allow you to do that because that's how the real world is and I think the point of school is to prepare you for it and so imagine you have two different sets of people you've got 100 people on one side and 100 people on the other and the 100 people on one side have electricity
(04:43) Wi-Fi internet computers versus the others don't well which one's going to produce more economic value obviously the one on the left not because these people are inherently better than the others they just have technology on their side right and so we have to think about ourselves from the country all the way down using the same tools so at the first layer the wealthiest people in the world the 0.
(05:07) 1% invest in gaining skills buying technology or learning skills to use that technology now if you're hearing this you might think like I would well cool that's great for them but what about me so that enters into Layer Two so let's zoom in on that what are the skills that actually create the production at the individual level so instead of global now let's talk about that per capita that person just like you just like me now how do the 0.
(05:30) 1% actually create that gross domestic product that gross production that Revenue that then gets categorized for the entire country well there are three skills that I'll call BSL and then they're multiplied by something that I'll use as R and you're like what do these all stand for well the first thing category of skills is around building you you make stuff you either build Bridges you build software sometimes building is putting together things so that you can do services but you build stuff the second is you sell stuff the third is you lead
(06:05) people and these also chunk up if you want the fancier terms here to Mechanical verbal and social skills so these are the three overarching categories that skill development as it relates to GDP can get bubbled up to now to be clear each of these skills are not binary it's not oh you know how to build oh you know how to sell oh you know how to lead but it's how well can you build how well can you sell and how well can you lead and so with each of these they create leverage they get you more for what you put in specifically time
(06:39) because if I build something then I can have many people use it over and over again if I learn how to sell I can sell many people at once if I learn how to lead I can get many people inside my company to do many things on my behalf and in each of these situations that one person starts to accumulate the aggregate production of everyone else that touches either the thing they built how they got people to exchange money for it or the people that they were able to lead to deliver and the outcome of all of these things is the big thing that everyone cares about which is money
(07:12) now the longer that this lever gets meaning if I get better and better at building then more money happens on this side if I get better and better at selling more money happens on this side if I get better and better at leading I can pull this lever with more leverage and get more money now what are the richest people in the world world have in common well not only do they have one of these skills developed out a lot many of them have all of these skills super maxed out and the difficulty with this drawing is that it's very hard to show that maybe the average person's lever
(07:43) looks like this compared to what the richest people the 0.1% actually make so let's zoom in on some of the biggest financial success stories of our time so if you look at Zuckerberg for example who's the founder of Facebook when he started he probably mostly just had build skills but those build skills were enough that eventually he learned a little bit more about promotion he built some promotion into the product which allowed him to get more more people on then over time he developed leadership skills so that he could lead the company and it's very common that building and selling
(08:14) happened in the beginning and then leading develops over time because in the beginning who are you going to be leading besides yourself right not many people and this skill naturally will develop in time but it gives you more leverage on the other two so let's get tactical on build so in this book $100 million offers I talk about uh the concept of trimming and stacking so it starts with looking at all the different problems that a customer presents with and then thinking okay how many different ways can I solve them and so I use something called the delivery Cube to say okay if we have this one problem
(08:43) how can I solve this by thinking about what level of personal attention I want to provide what level of effort would be expected from them if doing something like what kind of environment or medium do I want to solve this problem in do I want how do I want these people to consume my solution how quickly do I want them to get response or get their problem solved using my services or product and then if I were to create a product that was 10 times as expensive what would that look like and if I had to create a product that was on10th as expensive but still had to produce the
(09:13) same outcome how would I build that instead and so this is a wonderful framework that I like to think through and also wondering is there a way that we can psychologically solve a problem rather than simply logically solve a problem and Rory Sutherland talks about this when uh he he explains that some people used to complain about having slow elevators you could either replace the entire elevator system put a bigger motor in and try and get people there faster or you can just put mirrors in the elevators and then people stare at themselves and don't notice the time pass and so that would be a psychological rather than logical
(09:46) solution because customers are by and large illogical and so we want to make sure that the solution that we have solves the problem and sometimes it's not even in the way that You' logically expect now the way that this problem solution cycle actually works which I talk about in the leads book is that you're going to have one problem they present with and then you're going to solve it and then what happens is that creates yet another problem because let's say that you uh solve someone's uh hunger problem with a salty pretzel well what problem comes up naturally well now they're thirsty so then you solve that
(10:17) with a glass of water or a soda and so this this cycle continues and continues and continues now once you've solved those two problems what's the next problem well now their dessert stomach is empty so we have to present them with a cookie right and so there's always if you properly solve a problem for a customer there's almost always another problem that gets presented as a result of the solution and the main reason for that is because people are never satisfied and so over the span of many years a good Builder will develop an ecosystem of products that solves many
(10:46) customer issues at once so if you look at Apple one of the most valuable companies in the world if not the most valuable is it's not just that they have one product they've built an end to-end ecosystem that's closed so that someone can use just their products and solve most of their digital needs they've got a browser they've got computers they've got a phone they have music where you can buy the stuff everything is interconnected but if you're like oh I'm going to build that well that also took them you know 50 years or however long
(11:10) it's been so this stuff happens over time so that covers build but what about sell well selling is about the perception of the prospect which is that fundamentally you might have the best product in the world but if they don't perceive it to be the best product or even know that it exists then there's no way that they're ever going to use it and so we want to make sure that we can communicate that value to prospects ideally at scale so the simplest lowest leverage so think about this thing shortening the lowest leverage version
(11:41) of selling is selling 101 you sell somebody in person you sell them via chat you're just selling and you're closing One customer at a time over time you increase the leverage of sales by either you selling more people at once or getting through leadership which I'm getting ahead of myself getting other people to sell in your your behalf but in either situation you gain more leverage on the amount of people that find out about your stuff and ideally shift their perception of it so that they want to buy it again and again and again and when I talk about sell I
(12:12) actually talk about everything that takes someone from completely unaware to giving you money all right so that's all of acquisition so that's advertising Marketing sales branding promotion and conversion as in getting the person to buy and so the easiest way or the most important part of this is what I would call the call out which is people noticing your ad and when I say Ad I mean what if you reach out to somebody that's an advertisement you let people know about your stuff is the most important part and so I love this quote
(12:37) by David Ogie he says after you've written your headline you've spent 80 cents of your advertising dollar which just goes to show that that first impression is the part that one I test the most and the one that will shift their perception the most which is also part of something called Framing and so how you position again how people perceive the reason the intro of a video is so important the reason the intro of an ad is so important the reason the moment you introduce yourself how you introduce yourself is so important is because it frames everything else that happens afterwards and so let's imagine
(13:08) that you're at a cocktail party in a big Ballroom lots of people talking groups loud music playing in the background in all that noise a single sound pierces through it all and you turn around you want to know the sound your name you hear it and instantly look for the source and so a call out is whatever you do to get the attention of your audience call outs go from hypers specific to get one person's attention to not at all specific to get everyone 's attention so let me explain so if someone drops a tray of dishes in that Ballroom everyone looks if a child yells mom then all the
(13:37) moms look if someone says your name then only you look but again they all get attention and so we want to make our call outs specific enough to get the right people and Broad enough to get as many of them as we can and so with each of these skills you will typically start narrow and go broader Facebook when it started as a product was very narrow and then it just started with college students and then it expanded to high school students and then it started going to adults right when you sell in the beginning you're you're just going to advertise to a very small niche as clo you know as Tiny as you can mostly
(14:05) because you can't compete in the ocean you're you're not a big enough fish yet but you can win in the tiny pond right or maybe even a puddle but then over time as you get better and bigger you can expand the breath of the people that you choose to Target and so you will always convert a higher percentage not absolute but percentage of an audience by being more specific and so the easiest way to figure out what your customers want to hear when you're advertising and selling to them is to Simply ask them and if you want to be a super Advanced student go look at user
(14:34) reviews of all your competitors and figure out the things they complain about and then talk about those pain points and the things that you want to attract them with now the 0.1% know how to build things then how to let people know about it and get them to give them money for it the second core skill here which then leads us to the third skill because once you're building and selling and building and selling you're probably going to need help and that enters into leading so these are the social dynamics
(14:59) theas reason I think leading is arguably the most important skill besides learning is that it is a meta skill it gains you access to everyone else's skills and so at its most basic form if you were the best leader in the entire world you would be able to get the best builder and the best seller to come work with you and align with your overall objective I consider building selling and leading to be the tripod of business you must have all three they are the tripod of business you must have all three now you can be uh imbalanced and have a stool that looks a
(15:35) little bit weird but if you don't have one of these legs this thing's going to fall over and so you must have all three now the extent to which you have all three will dictate how much money you're able to make so if you can only sell and you can't build and you can lead then you'd have a bunch of people who are really good at selling something terrible so this would be like The Wolf of Wall Street's business so what he went to jail for and so that is basically lying at scale not good if you just build and no one finds out about it and you're good at leading for example then you'll just have this
(16:12) thing that's sitting in your garage that you promise is amazing but no one knows about it and so if no one knows about it no one can buy it and on the third extreme and this is why this one's a little bit more interesting is that if you could lead and somehow you found a bunch of people that no one in the organization knew how to sell or build this is why this is a meta skill then well really nothing would happen because you'd have nothing to build and no one would find out about it and you just have a lot of people that were somehow organized around doing nothing and so these are the core things that actually
(16:41) generate the activity the leadership aligns those activities in One Direction so fundamentally every single time you're considering bringing someone into an organization and this is what we're thinking about like either you are the person getting brought into the organization or you the person that owns the organization but we're talking about the 0.
(16:59) 1 wealthiest percent of people and this is how they think which is that every new person needs to support either selling more people or making them worth more through making the product better because the sad truth of it is that every new hire is a guaranteed cost but is not a guaranteed return and so unless they are building or selling they must support the activity of building or selling or they are waste and to give you a a a classic example that's been touted a lot is Steve Jobs the late great Steve Jobs um was a very good leader now a lot of people say that he was tough but say that they did the best
(17:30) work of their lives when they worked with him and so it's commonly stated that Steve Jobs didn't build the iPhone he built the team that built the iPhone and this is why it's such a high leverage skill and this is why it's a skill that the 0.1% if you look at the top of the Forbes list all have this that's fundamentally why it's the third bucket of the the biggest skills that generate the most money but if you're like huh is there any other variable that dictates how much the 0.
(17:58) 1% make well I'm going to give you the advanced one which is all of this is multiplied by risk which is the risk that you're willing to take on and so whether you're an employee of a company or you're an owner of a company there is a risk that you take on for the building selling and leading activities that you do that generate the economic activity that gives you the percentage of the production out there if you're willing to take on more risk this is a multiplier on all of these skills so if Steve Jobs and I'll give you Steve Jobs a perfect example when Steve Jobs had the company
(18:32) when it originally went public he owned 15% of the business he ended up leaving for a period of time starting Pixar and then he came back like 10 years later when he came back he was gifted a much smaller percentage of the company now here's where it's crazy when he originally ipoed apple he had 15% if he had not sold those shares that 15% today would be worth 465 billion making him by far the richest man in the world had he lived to this point and kept his shares and so the reason that he was never the
(19:06) richest man in the world is because when he sold his shares he gave up a lot of his risk he gave up a lot of his upside Bill Gates to the same degree when he ipoed had about 49% of Microsoft now if Bill Gates had continued to double down on that risk rather than selling and diversifying which is what he did today Bill Gates would be worth 1 and A5 trillion milon dollar he would be more than a trillionaire but because he chose to diversify he decreased his risk and so he got less on the asset that he owned which was built through building selling and leading if this video is
(19:43) helping make things click for you which is okay I I want to make the most money humanly possible I want to model the 0.1% and I understand that I have to build I have to sell I have to lead and I multiply all of that by the amount of risk that I'm willing to take on if you know somebody else in your organization or you want to share this with your employees uh it would mean the world to me because I'm trying to make the world a better place through economic activity and uh I believe that fundamentally every economy in the world could be
(20:12) super developed if everyone had enough education and skills so building and selling that feels relatively straightforward you learn how to code you learn how to make a service or you learn how to advertise you learn how to sell but how do you learn how to lead well I think an important part of this is learning how to orient behavior in a specific direction that yields the highest returns and when I say Orient Behavior I mean the behavior of the people who work for you or work alongside you and the strongest way that I have been able to get better as a leader is by eliminating wasted
(20:49) communication and so what that means is both internally amongst themselves but also for me to them and so that means that I think the vast majority of people are very in effective communicators is that they say many words and most of the times they don't even know what they're saying I'll give you an example so I had a director a couple days ago who came up to me and they wanted to reconcile uh this director was over you know a department and they said hey uh you know one of the people in my team has basically complained that somebody uh
(21:17) who's a director report of mine is doing this issue and so I said and and I'll tell you the words that um that they said they said I'm here because I want to bridge the gap between this department and this department and I want to support the growth and the overall initiatives of the business and all of those sound like wonderful corporate words but I I looked at the the person and I said what do you want to have happen and they kind of looked at me differently I said what Behavior are we currently doing that you would
(21:45) like us to stop doing or something that we're currently not doing that you would like us to start doing and so what's interesting is that when that question was posed to the individual they actually didn't have the answer and so this is very common is that someone will know that there is a problem but they will not come with an intended change in behavior and so you have to take that extra next step and say okay there's a problem what potential changes in behavior on my team or someone else's would need to occur in order for us to decrease the likelihood that this problem happens again in the future and
(22:16) so when you frame things from what would I like to occur what would I like to have happen as a consequence of this conversation you'll find that many conversations don't need to be had to begin with because most people don't even Define that and so they basically just make SP noise at at each other for 30 minutes and call it a meeting but no one actually changes what they do and so if you don't change what you do as a result of communication it was wasted it literally took effort from both people time from both people and then no change occurred and believe it or not this is the vast majority of people in the vast
(22:44) majority of companies which is why the biggest threat to Big organizations is waste and so if you want to lead you need to learn how to how to communicate clearly what you want someone to do what you want them to stop doing or you want them to do instead and by defining it in those terms it cuts away a lot of the ambiguity I had a meeting not that long ago with a a different person in in in the company and I said I don't understand what you do please explain it to me now most people you could imagine would be terrified by this question but I said I'm not intending to intimidate
(23:16) you the the point is that I actually don't understand and I'm seeking seeking Clarity and so one of the first things the individual brought up is I I do a lot of This research so that I can better understand X Y and Z and I said what does that change about what we do and the honest answer was it hadn't changed anything about what we do and I said so then if all of this time that you spend researching doesn't change our Behavior you don't need to do it it is a waste of time and so just like I could measure the temperature in the rooms when I record them and I could measure
(23:47) the temperature of every room that I walk in throughout the day just because I can measure it doesn't mean it's going to change anything and so many people spend a lot of time trying to quote understand but the only way you will get a return on that understanding is by changing what you do and so finally after several kind of peeling back the layers I was able to say you do this this is what you do you click these buttons you do this stuff okay and then all of a sudden the scope of what this person's uh role was went from this to this and I was like these are the only things that drive economic activity so
(24:19) how do we get you to do more of these things do them faster or do them better that is the question that we need to answer together and by doing this it just it just melts away a lot of the pre t a lot of the corporate jargon and so if you get into a conversation with someone and you don't know what they're saying don't assume that you're dumb assume that no one knows what's going on and I think that if you seek Clarity and you seek truth then you will ultimately find the best outcomes rather than seeking agreement and so we started with education at technology now we zoomed in
(24:51) at the second layer of the individuals what the actual 0.1% wealthiest people did they zoom in on their skills of building products that people love being able to communicate the value of that products and sell them on buying it and using it and then leading the team of people that could help do that at scale over and over and over again and if you're like well which one of these should I start with well everyone starts on a different BSL path now I personally started with selling because it's a chicken and egg issue at the very beginning you must have something to
(25:23) sell as soon as you have a basic amount of something to sell then you must sell it once you you do this well then you will have to recruit people to help you out so then you will learn leadership and so this tricep will continue to expand as you get better and better and better at all three of the tripod skills so if you're starting from scratch you first have to figure out what to sell once you figure out what to sell you need to learn how to sell it no economic activity can occur without both of these things you can't sell nothing and you can't build and not sell a dollar must
(25:54) exchange for goods and services so they have to know about it and you have to have something to exchange and so obsessing over your logo and your branding and your website is neither of these things unless you're selling the websites right and so you want to just start on how do I get people's attention so that they can give me their contact information so that I can communicate with them and explain the value of the thing I have and then what is required for me to deliver that thing I have the first business I ever started I just gave people my email and my phone number
(26:25) and then I emailed them personalized nutrition plans and work out plans so I had no CRM I had no website I just did those two things if you are a business owner at some point your business will get limited by either the quality of your product or the product offerings you have your ability to sell them meaning you don't have enough people coming in the door or you have both of these okay but you can't seem to scale it because you need more people and so being able to properly identify which of these things is the constraint will tell you where you need to reinvest your time
(26:57) to get more out of yourself and then when you do that you expand the lever and then more money shoots out so how does build sell lead relate to education technology well the Ed educational component is fairly straightforward you develop the skills around each of these three but what about technology well if you can use technology in order to build more things faster then you will make more money if the thing that you build is technological and allows more people to use it then you will make more money if somebody builds a table they will
(27:29) make less money than a developer who knows how to make an app that a million people can use because they're able to provide value at scale just with their own skill set but it's the skill of using technology so these things are very much interwoven with sales sure you can sell one-on-one but the leveraged way of doing it is using technology if you can develop a personal brand and have trust with a larger audience then you can sell one to many if you run advertisements one to many you're using the technology of the platform and media so that you can get more people's ATT ition and then ultimately convert it
(28:00) from a leadership perspective if you can track what your employees are doing if you run a project management systems you can increase the output per employee by using Technologies around leadership in each of these core pillars of value creation you're going to have the education to use the technology to maximize your output per unit of time and ultimately the money that you make which is what the 0.
(28:27) 1% do and so with the Advent of things like co-pilot for coders coders can actually write code 10 times faster than they could before and so with that as our as our as our our working model anybody who is not using technology is always going to be at a disadvantage and so if you want to be in the top 0.
(28:45) 1% it means you're competing with everyone and so you want to use as many advantages as you can and on a personal note I would say that I have been someone who's been more hesitant to use technology and I think that it has been a limiter to my success and so it's something that I'm spending more and more time on of okay how can I incorporate more technology into the products and services that we build how can I incorporate more technology into how we advertise and sell how can I incorporate more technology into how we lead recruit manage people even on the recruiting side it's like if we can have
(29:13) Predictive Analytics to figure out which candidates have higher likelihood of of matching with the organization and being good long-term productive employees then that decreased so much waste for us and again it increases our output per unit of time and the coolest thing about education specifically not necessarily technology is that when you have these skills they cannot be taken away they can't be confiscated they can't be stolen and this is near and dear to my heart because uh you know my family uh
(29:39) was or that we are Iranian um but during the revolution we left the country and uh all of our assets were seized and so in the United States this seems like a very crazy thing that you could lose everything overnight but in other countries this happens all the time the government just says oh all that money is ours now all that land is ours now your house is actually our house now but the thing is is that the the family members that I had who had skills and then were able to scatter all over the world which my family is uh they were able to start all over again and rebuild
(30:07) what they had lost the ones who didn't have skills and only had the few assets they had struggled a lot and still du to this day so the first layer was Global and we figured out education technology underneath of Education technology it's like where we investing that education technology technology around building education around Building Technology around selling education around selling technology around leadership education around leadership and so in each of those settings if we invest in them the lever expands and more money shoots out
(30:37) the other side and so the final layer is environmental so BSL creates the money and then that money is either wasted so it goes off the map it's stored meaning it basically stays the same or what the top 0.1% do is it's multiplied and the way that they multiply it is they either buy stuff or they lend so you can only do two things with money you can give it to people and then they give you a little bit more of it back in the form of debt or you buy stuff with it that either goes up in value sometimes it can go down but the hope is that it goes up
(31:14) in value and it produces an output so an example of the storage would be I buy a brick of gold a brick of gold does nothing and it's speculative in that we hope that somebody else in the future will pay us more for that brick of gold and no matter what currency I have I can trade gold for euros I can trade gold for for for Bitcoin I can trade gold for US Dollars it doesn't matter it's a store of value and as far as we've had in human history people still value gold now you could take all of the gold in the world and this is a waren Buffett
(31:42) example you could take all the gold in the world and put it in the middle of a baseball field and it would be about as tall as the stadium and be a big round Globe it doesn't matter what you do to that big ball of gold a 100 years from now it'll still be a big ball of gold but if you took that same amount of economic value and then you put it you would be and you invested it through buying you could buy all the Farmland in the United States and about 13 Exon mobils and so the amount of money that those farms and Exxon Mobile would spit out every single year over that 100 years would be at
(32:15) least greater than zero and so in that way this is how this Loop of wealth gets spun and so when you are buying or lending you're either lending to people who are doing BSL and the risk that you incur is that they don't actually succeed and you never get your money back you're compensated for the risk based on the interest that you charge for them so you basically sell them money for more money later with buying the assets what you're doing is you're buying a percentage or the entirety of their build sell lead now if you recall earlier I said this is all multiplied by
(32:52) risk this is where that money goes you take on that risk and and so as a result you get to have an outsized percentage of what other people are doing to build sell and lead and then this gives you even more money over time and so in understanding this this is why I built acquisition.
(33:22) comom the way I did which is we have these companies that generate money and then that money either goes back into the company to make it a bigger company or it goes into buying another company that generates money but then this process repeats itself over and over and over again and it compounds unto itself so no matter how big you get you can keep reinvesting all of that money and then it's a percentage-based growth so whether it's a million dollars growing by 10% or a billion dollars growing by 10% you're still growing 10% but the absolute amount of what that 10% is is $100,000 versus is $100 million and so if you're the individual you can take
(34:02) this money and you can invest it in people who are going to do build sell lead in your company where you take on more risk which means that you get outsize Returns on the investment in the people that's within an organization you can buy a slice of an organization of all of those people and not have to necessarily do anything that's what the public markets are more or less all about or investment funds do or at the most micro level you could just take that money and invest it in yourself by buying skills and what does buying
(34:30) skills even mean it means you pay someone to give you feedback on an activity such that you can replicate the outcome that they can already do fundamentally that's what buying skills is and so you find someone who has the skill that you want and then you offer them money so that you can continue to do the activity in front of them until eventually you replicate the outcome that they have because they have taught you the variables that they use to recreate that skill and once you can do it without them and get the same outcome than you have learned and so if we're
(35:00) thinking about this in terms of levels you can have a piece of a company you can have people that you hire in a company or you can put that money into yourself but all three of these are going to relate to BSL build sell lead and to what degree is the risk that you take on so buying a piece of a company would be probably higher risk a little bit less risk would be bringing somebody in and paying them the lowest risk is going to be investing in yourself but here's where it gets kind of interesting is that when you invest in yourself this
(35:46) can also give you all of the skills that you need to do all of these things better which is why and I will continue to hit this until the day I die you will always be the best investment and so you want to max out this bucket to the greatest degree possible and the limitation that you will have when you do reinvest in yourself is the time it takes to learn the skills and how many skills you can learn but at any given time you should always be spending as much money as you can to buy the most valuable skill that is constraining your
(36:15) growth and so if you look at build you look at sell you look at lead you figure out the one that's limiting you the most and you put as much cash into that thing as you can you pay every expert you possibly know or don't know or need to know in order to get what you need to move forward if I could isolate one decision that has changed my life forever was the willingness to invest my money in the potential to learn a skill from someone who is further ahead than me and I I will probably do that till the day I die because I have gotten
(36:45) better Returns on that money than anything else in the world and if you enjoyed this video on what the 0.1% wealthiest people invest their time and money into then you're going to love the video that I made on leverage it's the number one video on my channel it's basically how to go through a wealth warp of time it was one of the first presentations I made before I became public basically a consolidation of many of the thoughts that I had that created the generational wealth that my wife and I have been able to experience I hope you enjoy it

How I RAISE PRICES without losing sales...(using this psychological trick) - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GO6VCcLlnLs

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video i'm going to show you how to raise your prices it's one of the best ways you can increase profitability your business and ultimately make more money and give you more spending power pay people better provide better experience all of the many benefits that go with raising your prices but one of the fears of raising your prices is what if i don't sell anyone what if my sales team doesn't have conviction what if my market won't bear that price 99 times out of 100 it's purely in your head and in your sales team's head
(00:24) but having now raised my prices in a number of different businesses a number of different industries across different sales teams i have a process that has worked very very well for me and i'd like to share with you okay so what i've written here uh on the board here different prices uh that i might be increasing going from one thousand two thousand two thousand three thousand three thousand four thousand four to five six to eight ten to twelve these are common price increases that happen and what i want to do is kind of walk
(00:46) you through the strategy in a real way so that you can see what this equates to in a real business okay so if we're if we're going right i'm trying to uh increase from let's say 2k to 3k the way that i do it is i actually bump my my top price up by an additional uh percent all right and so i actually make the new price four thousand dollars which is the price acre this is what the sales people are going to say on the phone right and here's what's cool is that i say cool you can pay this four thousand dollars in in 2k you know and
(01:19) 2k right you can make that that payment that way and the reason we do that is because 2k is their their emotional anchor they're used to getting two thousand dollars and so i'm gonna say cool you still have that in your back pocket you're totally fine it's safe it's gonna be okay right so we're gonna say it's four thousand dollars which they can either pay 2k a ticket or they can get some same day savings and pay 3k today all right and so by doing this it allows them emotionally to have home base where they feel comfortable and safe asking
(01:45) for two thousand dollars right say cool and the extra payment you can make in 30 days or if you want you can just pre-pay it and pay 3k so it actually gives the sales people a discount to get the price that is now higher for us all right so let's walk through another one because i think this is uh this is something that's good to to walk through together so let's do this 4k one so your 4000 you want to bump to 5000.
(02:05) all right well again we're going to bump over to do we're going to skip over that 5k and we're going to jump straight to 6k this is going to be our new price anchor and we're going to say cool what i want to do is you can either pay 4k today and then 2k in 30 days now notice that this is a disproportion slip i prefer to do uneven splits personally because i want to still keep more cash up front right and the reason this also is cool now check this out right remember this person always said 2k well it's like well shoot i can either pay 2k now 2k in
(02:33) a month or so or just an extra thousand to get to the 3000 see how much easier this is to sell same thing happens here right you're at six thousand dollars you say cool 4k remember this is home base this is what our sales team is used to selling so they have conviction around this number they're comfortable saying something they don't get tongue tied around saying this number right it's like or so you can pay 4k today and then 2k in 30 days or you can just pay an extra thousand and get it all taken care of today right and
(02:58) so all of a sudden you're down selling this upsell you're down selling and making a discount compared to a price anchor which we introduced on the call so it actually makes it easier for your sales team to sell now this process that i just outlined is exactly how i raise prices because i've done i've tried to you know i've tried to just say okay guys you just got to deal with it it's just in your heads but you know as time has gone on and like i've become more weathered than this it's good to have a process and so a couple of the takeaways
(03:23) that i want you to see from this is one is that they're going to have an emotional comfort sailing around a certain price you have to accept that right and there's a reason that you're the entrepreneur because you tend to be a little bit more adaptable a little bit more flexible a little bit more growth worries and that's okay right but you have to meet people where they're at and so if this is what they're comfortable then we still need to give that to them so they still have that and that's what they can always ask for up front right
(03:42) and then the second thing that i want you to take from this so first is that you give them there so i'll write numbers on this right first is that you give them their home base number one all right number two is that the price that we are going to be anchoring is not the price that we're actually trying to get to so if we want to get to 3 000 from 2000 we're actually going to talk about a 4 000 price point which anchors high and then when we introduced number three which is the prepayment discount that is actually the
(04:08) number that we're looking for all right the fourth tidbit that i want you to take from this is noticing the discrepancy between what they can pay today versus what they're going to pay over time all right i prefer to have an uneven split because a i'm going to have more cost of onboarding i prefer to make more cash flow up front and the beautiful benefit of just the tiny incremental increase from that one payment from for a 4k 2k split compared to just i just pay 5k today and be done with that creates a very compelling
(04:34) offer all right now if i were to jump from let's say 10k to 12k this is going to be a really really minor difference right i could do uh do this a couple of different ways i could say you know 3 times 4k right or what i would probably prefer is something like 6 plus 3 plus 3 right so i get a little bit more up front for the payment and then more over time now notice if i do six super three then it's going to automatically encourage people far more to take this upfront prepayment discount right it's like well for only an extra one more thousand than
(05:06) what i would make on my second payment i don't have to make any more payments right and so you're noticing the four points that are that are going to be consistently used here right is that one we're going to try and give them home base as much as we can right number two we're going to jump over the number that we're planning on trying to price it at so we have a higher price anchor so that we can down saw the prepayment discount which is number three and noticing that the comfort price compared to the prepayment discount
(05:32) should only be marginal right and the reason we do that is because they're like oh man it's just a little bit extra and i can pay that now but what we accomplished through doing this and like that 4k that uneven split is that now we've successfully raised the price we've gotten more people to prepay because of the way that we structured the pricing and we've done it in such a way that the sales team can feel confident and convicted about it so they can sell consistently without any issues and i'll give you one more pro tip
(05:55) before we go so if you're ever going to raise your prices always always always clear the pipe all right so clear the pipeline so announce it always own your price increases it's one of the easiest ways to create true scarcity and urgency all right so if your team knows that this is going to happen then it gives them urgency to close more deals faster and clear out the pipeline so give them a heads up say hey we're going to increase the price next month hey we're gonna be increasing the price in the next two weeks so it gives people this this
(06:23) motivation to take action and not sit on the sidelines it allows your team to squeeze uh their pipeline to get some extra cash now here's another side benefit of when you clear the pipeline when you do this it also gets around you know some of those future people are like i heard a different price etc well it's like well we already gave you a heads up about it we told you we're gonna click we're we're adding more more features more benefits blah blah to the thing we have more successes we're making it easier and faster for you
(06:46) and so as a result the price is going to reflect that so get in now right and then you as the business owner get a nice boost of cash flow before you make the change so that you can weather maybe a dip in cash flow during the adjustment period which sometimes happens right it's just natural as part of the business all right so this is how you raise prices in a tactical format this is how i have learned to do it has worked very well for me i hope it works well for you the point of this channel is there's a lot of people who are broke and i make

3 Simple Fixes that Grow Any Business - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQuyQpFANpA

Transcript:
(00:00) I'm gonna solve three massive business problems that gonna take you from 10 to 100 million dollars and at the end I'm going to walk you through the framework so that you can apply this to your business your work or your personal brand I recently spoke an event it had a q a section and there were three different business owners that presented with different problems one was an employment setting business and they knew how to set appointments and build outbound teams for agencies coaches Consultants whatever the second business
(00:23) was a marketing agency for HVAC business owners the third was actually a very big influencer 30 to 40 million subscribers across all platforms with the objective of making more money so each of them had very differently phrased questions but they were all suffering from the same constraint and it wasn't what they thought it was so the first business that asked a question was an employment setting business and he was saying that his problem was that he needed to get more customers which by the way most the time that's not the problem it's usually
(00:48) because the customers you have keep leaving and that's the real problem and when we look at businesses to invest in at acquisition.com we operate off of a singular concept which is the theory of constraints a business will grow up to its constraint and then it will grow no longer most entrepreneurs continue to work on the things that they enjoy rather than the things that the business needs usually because they haven't actually identified the correct constraint for example if you have a three-step sales process and you get 50
(01:11) to go through step one five percent to go through step two and then fifty percent to go through step three you could improve each of them by ten percent but which of them makes the biggest difference in your business going from 5 to 15 triples the business whereas the other ones only incrementally improve it by twenty percent he had a very low quality of customers the vast majority of customers didn't make enough money they didn't stay long enough they didn't have enough skills Etc that was what he thought he
(01:37) had to solve he said okay of all of the companies that you've ever worked with which of them made the most money off of the appointments that you set right and you had a very specific answer of what type of Avatar he did best with and so there's two directions for that business one is you Niche down on your service delivery and say these are the only types of businesses I'm going to take because they're going to be worth more stay longer referrer Etc that is probably the easy easiest next step for that business if I were gonna own this
(02:03) business and I transplanted my brain and my experience with his body that he could own half of a 50 to 100 million dollar business that he grows over the next five to ten years picking the most valuable business that he sets appointments for what would the marketing spend be of a business that's doing 50 million dollars a year realistically probably somewhere in the neighbor of five to ten million dollars a year so he could either partner with that business or spend a year or two learning how that business works so that
(02:30) then he owns both sides of it if you partner you can usually go faster but you give up some of the upside because you slice the pie it's up to you because most business owners the reason they don't create valuable businesses is because they have to keep doing the same work over and over again and they don't get credit for it basically sentenced to this terrible atlas-like existence of rolling the boulder up the hill and then rolling it back down every every month but if the team that he built was 50 outbound guys this month and then next
(02:55) month he starts at 50 because it's all within the same company and then does another 50 and then another 50 D six months later he's got 300 outbound guys that are all still working for him all generating Revenue that he is owning a slice of all of it business number two was the HVAC agency this is a business that markets for HVAC companies 850 or so clients in that Niche and their running campaigns across 50 different local markets if he's able to generate leads and fill up 50 different HVAC Services pipelines because of his
(03:27) marketing prowess he probably has the marketing skill of a 50 to 100 million dollar HVAC business if you have a five million dollar marketing agency then it's reasonable that some of the clients that you serve are making 50 million dollars in Revenue off the services you're generating and you're getting none of that you're only capturing the service fee the more steps you take towards owning the result the more you're basically just doing the business for them but at a certain point you are the business and so it makes sense for
(03:54) you to own the economics of the business either you've got to learn the HVAC business or you partner with some someone who already knows it or you could buy one and with your marketing prowess you juice the hell out of it most people will try and buy it but then also try and keep this agency thing going but sometimes you got to take a half step back so you can take 20 steps forward the fastest way to build a 10 million dollar business is often not the fastest way to build a hundred million dollar business if you wanted to build a
(04:19) building that was 10 stories tall you would start with a very different Foundation now imagine you built a 10 story building and then said okay I want to build 100 story building using the same Foundation you wouldn't be able to but that's exactly what most entrepreneurs do when they're trying to scale and they wonder why they're stuck is because they built it wrong to begin with because they were in the wrong opportunity vehicle one of the big things that took me too long to learn was it's the size of the slice of the
(04:42) pie that matters not the shape of the slice of the pie they obsess about the shape of the slice rather than having a slice that's like this of a much bigger pie the average IPO founder when accompanying IPOs owns 12 and a half percent of the company they found it because the more people you make money the more money you also we make the third business was the big influencer business dude 30 40 million subscribers across all the platforms and they were focusing all of their attention on how do we get more high quality videos out
(05:10) and when I asked them what problem are you trying to solve they said we want to make more money you're seeing your business as this box of media and trying to make more better videos which if you want to do brand and just continue to build a brand before making us that would be the right problem to solve but they were at 97 out of 100.
(05:25) they're a point zero zero zero zero zero one percent Creator so do we really think that they're constraint of their business is that they aren't good enough at marketing no probably not you guys are trying to take your 97 out of 100 Media company to a 99 out of 100 Media Company when the objective you said was to make more money and you have no product that you sell so all of your monetization relies on sponsorships and AD and AD Revenue which is typically the least efficient way to monetize because anyone who pays you for a sponsorship is
(05:55) making a huge Arbitrage on your brand and your value given the amount of Impressions that these guys were getting which when they don't make videos we're getting 100 million views a month when they don't post anything new that kind of thing is a company that's 100 million plus in Revenue so they have the marketing department but what they don't have is a sales department they don't have a product department they don't have customer success they have none of these other departments they're 0 out of 100 on all these and so the constraint
(06:23) isn't going 97 to 99 it's going from zero to twenty on these ones what are the choices I have here version one is if I've got an average consistently comes to me I may be able to negotiate some sort of equity getting even 10 of a company that's worth 100 million dollars and then you put all of your effort behind it and make it a two or three hundred million dollar company that's a significantly better outcome for many of them than what they're currently getting paid just video to paycheck right the second option is to say okay is there a
(06:48) category of products that continue to pay me the most out of all the advertisers just do what Amazon does see what's already selling and then clone it and make it your own and put your name on it and make your version yours and better if you do that then you own the entirety of that thing but in order to do that you probably if it were me I would go snipe some of the topics act that some of those companies and say hey you're currently an executive here would you like to own a slice of my thing I'm happy to own 70 and get three of the
(07:18) best guys over have them build their boxes behind my thing that's the fastest and easiest way the longer maybe bigger money way is if you do it all yourself but that's always the trade that you have to make as an entrepreneurs how many new skills do I have to to have in order to pursue this new opportunity versus the ones I currently have the third opportunity for them is probably the least operational risk for accepting the fact that they just like doing media and that's what they jam on and they don't want to touch either these other
(07:42) business components ending themselves as a creative shop that knows how to make viral videos that they can transform into ads and that's where you go from being a really good Creator to being a Madison Avenue agency that makes ads that Crush most influencers are getting paid based on the Impressions that they are getting the brand for free based on their audience but where the real money is made is where you take that Tick Tock video that YouTube short that Instagram video that number it is and then they put a million dollars of AD spend behind
(08:11) it when it's already shown as a winner and then it goes from being shown to 5 million people in your audience to a hundred million people that it converts from cold ad spend has no limit on reach as long as it's profitable so they can always expand beyond your existing audience which means that you get to capture all of the upside based on how skilled you are as an Advertiser so those would be the three paths for that particular type of business it's not like okay well I'm not one of these three businesses now what I should do
(08:37) but it's actually the framework that we approach the problem with which is one what problem are we trying to solve in each of these businesses they wanted to make more money the next one is over what time Horizon if you want to make more money tomorrow the number of things you can do is very limited if you want to make more money in 10 years you take a very different play if the amount of time it might take to build 100 story buildings Foundation might take the same time it takes to build the entirety of a 10-floor building above the surface
(09:02) somebody else building a 10-floor building might happen way faster than you because as yours is just continuing to build this base before you start building up the next question which problem would we prefer solving or which problem do we feel like we're more equipped to solve or which problem is easier because if you start framing it in terms of the problem that you're gonna have to solve to be successful it actually makes it much more controllable for you I would say well which of these do we feel more equipped to do now at
(09:26) acquisitions.com we are really good at recruiting which is how we scale all the companies we have recruit Talent we've already been there done that and so we'd probably say hey we feel really confident that we could recruit somebody in and put seed capital in to get it going then we'd own the whole pie so for us that would be a problem that we feel very confident in solving and gives us the most upside you have to answer that for you given your skill set your resources and your experience

Transcript:
(00:00) my wife and i acquired 100 million net worth by the time we were age 32 and as a result of that we had very different views and perspectives on money and happiness and i was recently interviewed in a two hour long podcast with graeme steffen and he asked questions about it and from what i understand a lot of people shared and talked about this particular section of the podcast and so we chose to cut this out and give it to you in the next 11 minutes and if you don't know who i am my name is alex mosey on acquisition.com it's a
(00:24) portfolio of companies so enjoy the video welcome to buzzy nation and i'll see you on the other side like a lot of people make statements like they're like isms like this is this way um like i have this thought and it is and you're like and i've just accepted that like i'm always gonna have this like i would just never speak that over yourself just right off the bat because like you're just saying i'm never gonna get over this thing like the statement you said earlier about like at the end of the day i just like i just want to be happy like
(00:46) when you admit that you just want to be happy then what happens is you create a deficit between your current reality and happiness which means that it doesn't matter what happens because there will always be happiness that is outside of yourself that make sense kind of yeah i mean but i would consider myself no no he didn't get that at all no i got that because i'm like looking at chad like oh man but i thought okay so here's my here's my interpretation of it if i'm telling myself that i just want to be happy then i will never be
(01:11) happy that's what you're saying no i understand what you're saying right but i'm telling you right now that i am happy now good so but it okay wait graham i why do you still think i don't understand that so like deficits deficits occur when we speak desires right and so um i love this statement um a desire is a contract we make with ourselves to be unhappy until we get what we want and so whenever we state a desire like i want this i want this amount of money i want whatever you literally sign a contract that says like i won't be unhappy until
(01:44) that happens right and so like i had this thing earlier on where i was like i want to have meaning i want to have great meaning in my life and i was talking to a guy who made a lot more money than me because i asked him i said how do you create and destroy meaning in your work that was the question i asked him on a podcast and he was like why do you think life needs to be meaningful and it was the same exact thing as the happiness versus like the meaning thing where it's like i say life has to be meaningful and therefore
(02:05) everything that i'm doing like i create this expectation of life whereas if life just is it just is and it's the only way that you can actually be there um it's just it's just pure acceptance right um which is why like the whole like shoulds of like we should work we should have balance we should acts it's like i believe marriage is a compromise like these are just statements of belief that are casting expectations out in the world that are just bound to be untrue at some point and then create dissonance and so it's like i believe marriage is
(02:35) marriage and i believe my marriage is my marriage and i believe your marriage is your marriage and like i believe that i can work 24 hours a day if i want to and that is all period not and it's bad or and it's good there's no judgement on it it just is and so like if i get you know if i get dopamine secreted in my brain when i start working cool like and i will optimize for dopamine and if i die i know that in a thousand generations nothing i do anyways is going to matter so who cares like that's like the the opening thing in my book is
(03:03) like there are no rules like we live in this like this like shoulds and have to's and like like happiness everyone talks about it and it's just like everyone is unhappy because they say they want to be happy rather than being like accepted like happiness like i just am period and then like i don't need to judge the am it just is how do you what do you say to that i don't know that makes sense yeah because so one thing i notice is if you're like i just want to be happy yeah does that mean alex that you think that at some
(03:34) point that will change for you or something or you're you have you live no i think that will change i think you guys maybe are taking what i'm saying the wrong way i mean like like alex is saying you know everybody has different beliefs and there's no one rule fits all to everybody and so if i say i want to be happy that doesn't make me wrong like if i want to live my life that way that's perfectly fine but the the thing that that what jack is saying is no i am like happy like i but i for me i like to make like a conscious
(04:08) effort to work towards that and alex can live his life like life is life my marriage is my marriage um and it works for him and that generates happiness whether he's like thinking about it but it doesn't have to generate happiness that's the problem right yes yes like right like but like because it makes like not because it's like when people say like hey um work uh you know set these goals and like the rest will take care of itself it still makes the rest taking care of itself the reason that you're doing it which means
(04:37) that it's actually not getting around it when people were like you got to be process driven if you're like if we focus on the process the goals take care of themselves it still means that the goals are important so like you have to if if you want to make the transition from like a process driven life which is like i'm doing these things to do them period then the so that i can be happy so that i can have a good marriage so that i have a meaningful life has to disappear from the equation it has to be i do them
(04:59) period not because i do them but then it goes back the other way like but why because you say so like because you want to right like if you want to have if you want to ascribe a meaning to why you're doing something you can do it for whatever reason wow this is deep so i mean this is what i spent a lot of my time thinking of because i have nothing else to do and this is what my last year was was like trying to figure out like why why i didn't have like i i felt the exact same way while i was well i had nothing as to where i have now i
(05:28) feel the same like like people were like man it was cool when the money hit my account i felt nothing like truly like not even like the two-day like i it was irrelevant how did you learn all of this did was this through speaking with other people who have been there before you thinking um i mean my closest friend is a philosopher and i use that in terms of like the actual meaning of the word philosopher so like filet to love and then sophos is wisdom or knowledge so like he's a lover of knowledge lover of wisdom and like we talk every week it's
(05:57) like the only standing meeting that i have is we talk for like two hours and we just talk about life and he's one of these guys who like lives in a cave um and it's like he got his phd when he was 20. like just a very brilliant guy and so he and i just talk about things you know should uh share his contact information for some guests on the podcast oh i mean he's brilliant i mean if you like dr cashew is brilliant he's the he's the smartest human that i know in terms of like brilliance and their ability to communicate it um in a simple way um and
(06:25) so he helped me get over a lot of the things that i that i used to struggle with and a lot of it was just like the language that we use matters a lot because like how we say things is how we think things and so like what i was saying earlier alex and this is not like this is not like a slide i'm just saying like when i hear like when i hear anyone talk like on my team or or customers or whatever it's like people talk so many things over themselves and they're like i don't know why i'm not successful and it's like
(06:52) well define success and why are you not and then what are the you know i mean like i just want to do this to be had like there's so many chains that they put on themselves that it becomes very difficult to live and so like i spent a long time trying to not do that and it was just because like i was unhappy and i didn't like being unhappy and then i stopped judging myself for being unhappy and then i stopped thinking about it all together and so i think that like i'll give you a really real example for this so one of the things that i'm vehemently
(07:19) opposed and i'm like you no one give gram flack you can give it to me um and like this is coming from a family through like had out alcoholics and drug addicts and things like that like i really don't like the alcoholics anonymous um concept of every morning waking up and saying i am an alcoholic high you know whatever and then they go into their in their meetings because what it does is it puts it at the forefront of their mind and they they literally label themselves every morning is having this problem when somebody
(07:45) who's not an alcoholic just doesn't think about it they don't think i'm an alcoholic i have to fight not drinking every day they just don't think about it and so i think to the same degree that like living a meaningful life is not saying like i'm living a meaningful life you just are and you're not casting it you're just you just are but don't you think some of that is just that inherent belief that some people just have they're raised from that they have positive experiences that turns into a spiral but the people who don't have
(08:13) that who are used to every day being like i'm worthless i suck at this i am bad at this don't you think that maybe that like first step in like getting in that direction is positive affirmations of like i could do it i could isn't that like that's better than zero like i feel like we're going to zero to one because i think it's exiting i think it's exiting the equation all together so saying i am worthless instead of saying like i want to be worthy or i am worthy just saying worthiness doesn't matter but then wouldn't you get just people
(08:41) not caring at all yes yeah so i'm 100 annihilus yeah like i believe nothing happens and like you know it is what it is right but and there are different ways to take that some people are like life is meaningless and there's no point in any of it which i would agree with them and then the other people were like there's no point in any of it and so i'll do what i want and some people see that as like very very very self-serving which it might be but to the same degree like you are released from the chains of the
(09:07) expectations of others and most people in my opinion that i have witnessed who are unhappy is because they are weighted down by the chains of their parents of their friends of their siblings of the whatever things the people that they believe are casting judgment on them and they care so much about that person's disapproval that they don't want to do the things that they want to do and so if i think it's easier to get someone to realize that none of it matters and then build from there than to try and flip the negatives it's just to exit the
(09:33) equation altogether to say none of this matters therefore i will start my youtube channel and not care if my dad says that youtube isn't real like it's not about being worth it like this is one where they're like i deserve success like they don't no one deserves anything but you can do the stuff that gets success independent of your deservingness give me a terrible person and get and become successful so that person doesn't deserve but they did these things that create success if we define success as some material whatever
(09:58) and so i think um like if you can exit the equation of like labeling yourself and then just doing because because what else will you do while you are alive it creates some levels of freedom that allow for clarity of thought and also for the ability to take risks that most people can't take

I Was Wrong About Mentorship... - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=39I8jEqFdYc

Transcript:
(00:00) I've had a lot of mentors in my career many of them were paid a few of them were free the point of a good teacher is that the student does pass the teacher I see this thing that happens all the time when you're a kid and you learn arithmetic first you learn your numbers and then you learn how to add you level up and you learn how to multiply and then you level up from there and you learn algebra when you get to algebra you don't think man my arithmetic teacher is a idiot I can't believe they didn't teach me this stuff it's like
(00:23) dude you weren't ready and you had to have the arithmetic in order to get to the multiplication it's not that that teacher was an idiot it's that that was the sequence and so when you have a first teacher that teaches you the basics and you have a more advanced teacher later it doesn't mean you should on your first teacher it's like that person got you ready to receive the next thing earlier on my career I definitely did the other way this guy didn't know anything this guy is the guy rather than seeing it like you would see
(00:45) any other thing that you'd have in school I've had the opportunity in the you know the gift of being able to Mentor whatever you want to say you know provide advice counsel share my experiences a lot of people hold me in a regard and most people who are winners are competitive it's just like who you are right you want to win you to beat everybody because that's that's part of the competitive drive but I think there's like a there's a comma there that needs to get put in which is that you have to accept two things one is
(01:09) that you are going to die and no one is going to remember like real real ten thousand years from now no one's going to remember at all number two is that when you're at the end of your life the people who are going to be your buyer vets are not the people who you Vanquish but the people that you helped I know that I have passed a lot of the mentors that I've had in my career in terms of financials Etc earlier on used to think that made me better than them as I've had a couple more years and some more more scars I've realized something
(01:33) different which is that I was only able to get better than them because they gave me the Head Start step on my shoulder you can reach that next Branch I think I experience a lot of Joy knowing that other people don't have to suffer as much you know we're walking around outside yesterday and someone's like dude I did everything you have and we're doing four million dollars a year now like he was like emotional just knowing that it's happening it makes stomaching the hard times easier it feels like it's not just me trying to do
(01:56) this for myself it's me trying to do this for a lot of people if I'm failing over and over again at this thing I know that once I figured out I'll be able to help 100 people cheat code their way through it and not spend five months figuring something out or two years figuring something out like I was stuck at Mid 30 million for three years to everyone watching they're like boo hoo that's not the point is that there's another guy who's going to get to that point and he's going to move right past it like in a blink of an eye because
(02:17) I've had the right advice that I didn't have and I think that if the mentees and the mentors both see it that way then the mentees will stop on the mentors that help them and the mentors will stop trying to hold back secrets that have propelled them further because the point is not that you're going to beat everyone you're going to get really old and then you're gonna die as you're getting older they're going to be people who are younger who had a head start and as long as the next guy honors the fact that that guy died on the battlefield to
(02:44) give him these lessons and come back and they have to recognize that they're going to die on the battlefield too for the Next Generation to pass them they have it easier than us that's the point of progress and so rather than lamenting that the Next Generation has it easier I thought that what we all say I want to make the world a better place well that's what making the world a better place looks like we say that this is our mission with our business we want to make the world a better place we want to make an impact
(03:06) and then when it actually happens we resent the kids for the fact that they didn't have it as hard as us that was the point my point is not to beat the progeny a point is to forge as far as I can look back and be like hey watch out for that hole watch out for that rock keep going keep going because they move through the path that we tread three times faster than we did because we already cleared all the trees they get to the next non-clearing and they have to start hacking away and hacking away and hacking away to forge the next PATH
(03:31) and then they become the mentors turn around and the Next Generation moves six times as fast to cover my distance and their distance if you look at some of the greatest success stories a lot of them talk about their mentors Warren Buffett had his mentor early on the quick story on that was that he said I'll work for you for free and Paul Graham told him you're overpriced he was the one who's going to be giving far more to this relationship even if Warren gave him his time he still was going to to be on the losing side but he still
(03:53) did it anyways because he recognized that Warren had a gift Warren passed him in his career you'll notice that Warren isn't like man I'm so much better than Paul Graham I passed that dude in my like 40s he doesn't talk like that we really do stand on the shoulders of the Giants when I think about like the gratitude that I have for the garyvee's who is 12 years older than I am he's forged so much of this path that like I didn't have to think about how am I going to create this whole thing it's like he already had a blueprint and I
(04:16) could just start laying that out immediately execute there are guys who we have in our portfolio right now who are in their 20s who are making twice when I was making at 30 but if they came to me below and then now they're above that was the point garyvee didn't have Gary Vee to Mentor him on his career I do right now we all do many of us will pass Gary and I don't think Gary mines there's a 20 year old it might be you who's watching this and you've got me that's the point I'm still going to be hustling trying to beat you don't get me
(04:42) wrong when I see guys who are in their 60s I'm like man by the time I'm 60 I'm gonna be 10 times as wealthy as that 10 times the the real estate 10 times yeah but if they had had themselves as mentors they would too if your mentees and the students that you have and the people that you help and the people that you teach don't move above you it means that you're a bad teacher not a good one the new definition of success of a teacher is that the students surpass the teacher and then get to the point where they're both looking together with his
(05:06) experience and his Raw Talent looking at the new landscape saying all right what do you think we should do if this video changed your mind about some of the talking that you've done to a teacher or to a mentor who is earlier on in your career shoot that guy a text and be like hey like respect I appreciate you I can't tell you one how much it means to the mentor when they get that text and I also think too it'll help you spit out the poison that you had that wasn't real it was only made up in your head I think
(05:26) if you can do those things this video would have been a success

4 Steps to Unf*** Your Business - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kloJJeiysxg

Transcript:
(00:00) there are four big levers in your business that could be messed up I'll show you how to figure out which one it is and how to fix it so you can scale your business we had those four levers that I had earlier we've got traffic we've got conversion we've got price and then we've got churn so those are the big four things and so if we want to grow the business those levers have to change or the business will not grow and so for many of you it might just be you need more traffic like the business model is fine the economics are fine and you need more traffic and so basically
(00:30) at least my thought process that I have with this is I try and scale as much as I possibly can until something breaks and then when it breaks we fix that thing and then go back to scaling the [ __ ] out of it again I mean fundamentally that's what we do and um I mean I I teach this at at for for businesses but I'll I'll walk you through it what is going to go to these four levers that we talked about earlier right which is going to be your traffic your two FS there whatever conversion which is you tweaking your about page making a vsl that's better adding Carousel images tweaking the
(01:06) bullets that you have on your landing page uh you've got the price which you can test and then you've got churn right which has a big list of things that you can do so these are the four levers the things that you're doing have to Lad up to one of these four if it doesn't lad up to one of these four things why are you doing it all right so like if we were to translate your objective with the free group you would have to say okay I think that the US reactivating the free group will increase traffic that's fundamentally what you do it you want this traffic source to make you more money from your to towards your ticket High ticket thing and you say
(01:35) okay how much work will it take me to reactivate this group okay is there anything else that could get me more traffic than reactivating the group of the things that I have available so right now could me just spending more money on ads or making better ads make us more than me spending the time to reactivate the group if so forget reactivating the group make better ads or spend more money on ads does that make sense so once you figure out and when we're picking which of these three things four things that you're doing the thought process is what which of these
(02:04) is the biggest constraint in the business and so if conversion rate let's say for example on the on the landing page is super low then it might mean like hey before getting more traffic I'm going to I think I can double my conversion on this page because I haven't really spent any time on it at all okay well then it makes sense to spend a day or two like can I really clean this up and make it as crisp as humanely possible with the language that I use can I grab screenshots that are more meaningful that like you probably
(02:28) had more testimonials things like that you haven't updated like can I put that on there can I make an actual 3-minute vssl that that is more compelling than the one that I just like tossed up there okay that's probably a day of work well it's probably high leverage because I can double the growth of the business by just improving this conversion metric pricing like well if everybody just pays you more we already went through that example over here um this could obviously make you more money and then you have your big list of things that you're doing for turn and so cool which of these is the biggest uh thing that's
(02:54) going training the business you pick the one that you're working on and then for me I tend to think through this more better new and I tend to do it in this order most of the time so like I will just ask one of our portfolio is like why can we not just do more of what we're currently doing like whatever we're doing why can't we just do more so you'd have to make an argument to me that we should reactivate this group rather than just spending more money on ads and you have to make an argument that it's easier and it will make us more money than spending more money on ads and if you came with the
(03:28) argument that' be like well then forget about it if we can't do anymore for whatever reason we have some limitation like we can't post more than twice a day on Instagram like we just can't or we can it just like we've seen that when we post three times it doesn't doesn't heal the same performance so two is kind of The Sweet Spot fine all right then what can we do to make it better right okay because if we can make those two posts just higher quality overall can we like really think through the hooks can we make sure that they're tight that they
(03:52) appeal ideally to the audience that we're looking for if we do better then the quality of the traffic will go up the more views will go up does that make sense now if we can't do any more any better then we need to try something new and you notice that most of the times you can do more of what you're doing you can do what you're doing better which is why I so rarely do new things once you have something that works that's the hard part once it works it's like how do we scale the living crap out of it and the reason that most entrepreneurs in my
(04:14) opinion especially small ones get stuck is that they find something that works and they stop doing it and then they get distracted by six other new things and they get completely spread thin and it's and like what's ironic is that the small business owner is the one who has the least amount of Leverage and you have the basically your your contribution your time contribution to the the income of the business is more direct than anybody else's especially at this level and so like you like saying okay I'm going to take a third of my time that might just be like decreasing your business by a third um and so you have to have a very strong
(04:44) argument for why that's going to make sense and then for who once you have a team then that becomes the the next thing it's like okay we know we going to increase traffic the way that we're going to do that is like we can't do more posts on Instagram so we're going to make them better and this is the process that we're going to focus on getting better which means that uh once a week I'm going to take three hours and and I'm going to script out I'm going to look at other people's you know content that have really good hooks I'm going to write down all the hooks and then I'm going to make content that I think is
(05:07) going to appeal to my demographic in a better way cool now who's going to be you know if it's you then you're the who in a lot of these if the business gets bigger then it's like okay Jeremy you're running this and then we just measure to make sure Jeremy does his job that makes sense in terms of thinking through this and so we just want to make sure that what you are doing is going to map to what's going to drive growth within the business and I swear to God so many times people are just doing [ __ ] that does not map to this okay Red's
(05:38) over one quick question on that the the first four is there like a certain priority that you would recommend for like I'm a solo operator I'm doing like 50 a month P Toc offer is there like one of those big four that you would recommend prioritizing first start here okay because this is how you have lifeblood in the business so you have to promote you have to acquire customers once this is relatively consistent even at a low level I then this is me how I think through this now not when I was younger normally I would just be like
(06:06) just do as much of this as you can foret everything else now it's do enough of this so that we can keep working on how do we how do we find the things that people actually want versus what we think they want and then there's the things that we can remove like how can we delete things how can we make this simpler how can we make it more elegant how can we shorten the the models that we have I mean we're hiding classroom for new people like think about this like we remov three calls a week like we're trying to take things away not because we don't want to add it's easy
(06:33) for us to add the value it's but we want we want them to consume it and so consumption should be the highest priority for everybody here in terms of making like how do they get value they have to consume value right so consumption should be the highest priority and so um we start here until you have enough flow going through the system that we can see what they really want and a lot of times these simple things like the last semester I think we went through a ton of depth of all the things that you can do to reduce turn
(06:59) right it's like so you experiment with that and this might be months while you're doing this I mean for context school didn't hit like a like let's go hypers scale until like recently and this was years right of getting the product right like obviously like there's people coming in every day and there was enough promotion that we basically we could test and keep learning but it wasn't like we don't want the world to find out about it yet because we want to get all these pieces right once these pieces are right enough
(07:24) then you go back here you scale living hell out of it boom yeah it's great so right now the question for you is if you have really low turn I don't know if you do but from what you were saying it sounds like you have low turn then then yeah do more traffic yeah do more do better of what you're currently doing so you're are you running ads yeah so you spend more spend more and Mak them better top 20% of my best customers targeted towards them now that I have that insight and then just keep making that better and then just more more better and then just spend 400 Grand a month on ads yeah sure
(08:01) I mean it's like an inside joke in my business like he's just going to say more better it's like y that's what we're going to do this quarter just like we did last quarter just like we did the cor before we're going to do more we're going to do better and if we do both of those things we'll probably make more money and then if there's something that prevents us from doing more or better then we fix that and then we go back to more better does anyone have questions about what they need to do for this like like you need you're like okay am I should I be spending more money well if you're if your LTV is good in
(08:25) terms and your and your and your CAC is low then yeah I just keep spending I guess for like low ticket communities you know recently you had a video where you went like seven things like a handwritten letters on boarding exit interviews yeah for communities on school like which one of these would you go after the first kirby I feel like you have even more insight with you the price sounds like the thing that's moving at say again the price okay because you've already experienced what that's doing right you know the average is around 20 you probably want to be on
(08:56) the good side of that so figure out why you're not like I would talk to your customers first like why did you cancel you want to talk to the people that cancelled you want to talk to the people that stayed and you want to figure out what differences they have and then if you find the people that stayed did these things emphasize those things if you find the people that left did other things remove those and so it might not be price I'm just yeah it but you told us so um maybe it's price so like balance that and then you know with your traffic you you can
(09:33) drive more of that and then you can play with about page conversion you can play with that and then when you're bard of those go back to retention CH I know I can drive like easily way more traffic it's just that I have a leaky bucket so I want to fix it so I'm like wondering if I should add the onboarding or you know EV onboarding I think for sure is a good idea and how would you execute that for low tickets you do a group onboarding and everybody who signs up gets one group on on boarding that you
(10:01) attend you do it once a week I think people throw a lot of [ __ ] in their community and then they just keep adding and then they think they need to keep adding to make it better but it's not true like overwhelm is the main cause of churn think about the experience so how many things in the classroom would you say is like The Sweet Spot cuz like right now I have like eight maybe the honestly the hardest part I found when improving anything is to figure out what's actually wrong with it that I've I've been working on the
(10:30) school games funnel recently by the way homos will be happy about this um I figured out like what the problem to try to figure out what the problem was was actually quite difficult but in the was my it was this guy I knew from New Zealand who's a complete stoner that had text me when hosi when hosi launched the games he couldn't understand what it was and I was not going to try to explain it to him but when we came back to making this improving it I was like it turned out that he was the best signal for it actually what the [ __ ] is
(11:08) the school games I wrote it down that was the problem if you didn't know what school was you have and you see an ad from homos and he's talking about the school games and some leaderboards and coming to Vegas people don't know what the [ __ ] that is so I wrote down what the [ __ ] is the school games and I was like that is the problem so but that took me a lot of research to to like mind right I was talking to a lot of people I was doing this with Kirby it's quite an interesting process right and then we were like okay well how do we describe
(11:39) this damn thing in a way that is make sense to like a stoner dude um because it helps to use extreme cases like Steve Jobs tested products on children because like if they could understand it anyone could understand it right so like defining the problem and then coming up with different ways you could solve it I've been doing this with goose and Kirby in the office all week we probably designed we came up with many different ways to describe what it is many different landing pages many different bullets and we just kept talking to users getting feedback and kept iterating it we probably made 30
(12:19) versions some of them were so wrong it was I wondered what kind of tangent you'll never see it but you know we actually at the end of about one week we landed on something and um and now everyone we show it to instantly gets it it's like we don't actually have to fully launch to find out when you learn how you can use everyone to get like feedback and talk to people and show it to people and get their reactions you can do a lot of fast iteration Cycles without the harshness of like reality then when you launch it
(12:54) into reality you have a way better chance right um so that's how you improve anything like that that's not the games but that's what we were doing to the games recently we Kirby was doing interviews with all of the winners that was overwhelming not many people were showing up so we cut that we just did one hosy Q&A a week right attendance is up every viewing is up people are now saying that it's way more valuable and you know so it's we were unlocking the one day recordings after you got three customers we like why are we making it hard to get the
(13:35) most valuable thing now you just need three members they can be free right so like what do people value how do we make more people experience that what do people not value take it out what do people not understand reword it you see it's all the same but I I will I will I will emphasize what Sam saying is that there's a it's so much more work than you expect it to be and everyone wants like the one silver bullet that you're going to magically fall on it but if it were obvious you would have already done it and so it's
(14:06) like it's disguised and that's what I mean this is literally what makes business hard and so I'll have a business owner on a Q&A call say like what should my price be and I'm like I don't know I'll walk you through the process of how I'd figure it out but I don't know your avatar I don't know your traffic scource I don't know the value prop of your community and even if I did I would say I'll start here and I'm going to do the math and I'll move it and I'll do the math I mean with the portfolio same thing I it's like we tested 50 35 25 15 we just tested it I
(14:33) was like I don't know we'll find out and then they were all the same and then I was like okay well which business would I prefer and then we go into that right and so just just in terms of thinking through things like the amount of effort that goes into it that most I would say that like as I've gone as I've G moved up in business the my understanding of the level of effort that's required to solve complex problems has gone up 100x it's just significantly harder to solve more complex problems and that's also why the biggest paydays are on the other side of those problems because if
(15:04) they were really easy to solve everyone have already solved it so it's like four hours in a cup of coffee and a bunch of data and you're like all right let's try this there's a quote I learned from the software engineers at school they say you have to make every detail perfect but the only way you can do that is to limit the amount of details that you have so inside of the school games we have eight videos all of them together are less than 45 minutes one calls we do one call per week and that's it and once a month you get a download
(15:36) from here the Mastermind that's it very easy to explain to someone one call one course one Mastermind a month and there's 13,000 people in there each paying 99 a month and they get the school [Music] software I have a question yeah so there's a fine balance between because if you're a leader of a big Community right if you're showing up too much you kind of almost lose your power right and if you do Q&A every single day nobody want it's not special so how would you balance Q&A calls making posts inside of the community and just showing up and
(16:18) like giving people attention like that I'm sure there's a data answer for this rather than me just guessing we can probably find it out of like what the the best you know Cadence is I'll tell you I personally I think post twice a month in school that's not planned I just I just kind of poke around and I see what people are struggling with I made that Niche post because I was really tired of people be like what's my Niche going to be about and I was like here's how you find your Niche and so it's just like I just listened to what was the like there's you probably
(16:46) noticed this in your community it's probably like a pro like a problem dour it's like people just kind of glob onto a single problem all of a sudden and like I felt like I was seeing more and more of that so I was like all right I'm going to try and answer this and so then you make that and then it's like hope and if it does if you put the thing in and then that problem still exists then you didn't do it right so it's like you have to do it again you have to make it simple you have to make it easier whatever it is you keep doing it until that one goes away and then like the
(17:09) next problem will occur and the good news is that your customers will always have problems yeah and so you just solve them I can tell you a good thing that works for me um so I spend a lot of my time reading what people are saying like I'm trying to understand what things people are struggling with so I'm not in there just posting a lot I'm in there listening the most more than anything else most it would be like 90% it would be like a lot of time is spent listening trying to figure out what is going on
(17:42) what should I improve what problems is the community facing right then when I'm pretty sure I've got those problems I'll even talk to some pal users and I'll validate do you think these are actually problems right and then I'll make sure I'm clear on the problems first okay now if I spend now prioritize them what's the most what is the most pressing problem okay number one now just focus on that at least I know if I just fix that I'll add some value right yeah so now I'll try to fix that and I will try
(18:13) to fix that by research experimentation Etc and then I'll come back to my community and say hey I saw all you guys were facing this it sucks I fixed it here you go [Music] and that's how I like that's how you add value seriously no like I have I have this little template on my wall for emails which is uh hey I made this thing for you here's what it does good afternoon enjoy like CTA like that's like that's my email template like it just makes it really simple like hey you guys were struggling with this thing I made this for you here's why it's important goodbye the hard part is
(18:52) finding the thing yeah like I said how do we make the school games funnel better well what's the problem with it that's the real question and it was some Stoner dude who had the answer yeah so you wouldn't have a schedule of like posting daily or second like every second day or definitely not that's like a Henry Ford production line for Community like we're not trying to pump out posts fast that's not what makes a robot it's not that's not a good Community a good Community is something that under stands your pain and
(19:31) experience and delivers Solutions and is fun yeah you right yeah and isn't overwhelming and doesn't make me read five articles a day right like value Post Yeah cuz I don't want to read a bloody article that's a pain in the ass like I want a solution or I want to laugh one of them yeah I'm doing 17 lives a a week in my paid at the moment so but my my feelings telling me to put it in the free community but I mean that might be stupid because I'm trying to listen to what you guys are saying you're saying no we're just doing one now and it's like so I'm a bit the [ __ ]
(20:12) you know I think if you want to use all that like all that so last last games a ton of people I think it was last games it was like it was like the lives games it like everybody was doing like Instagram lives might have been maybe two ago um and that the thing is is like we have to separate promotion from so from a promotion perspective you're doing lots and lots of lives you're making lots of posts you're making all this stuff oh no I understand I got you and so my point is is like I would take all that energy and put it into promotion so you get way more people
(20:43) into your community and then the thing is is that you if you do 17 lives a week externally it's okay that people don't consume all of them because if they consume one of them then they might buy whereas if you're inside of the community and you're doing 17 they might be like oh I'm missing out on 16 out of the 17 I'm not I'm not getting the value if it's free your cost is time and so as long as you deliver a return on the time that they spend consuming your content then they got they have a positive
(21:11) exchange with you and so you basically it's like you can never promote too much you can put too much inside of the community and so I would take some of that Juju and put it externally to drive more through the box I think H actually did like the opposite like when he increased the daily coffeee to like nearly every day oh his churn like reduced massively so I have no idea oh he's messing me like every day and trying to figure out like all kinds of things around churn at the moment um I my answer to him he keept coming up with ideas my answer to him was talk to your customers I recently was pretty public
(21:48) about this is that like I widened my content for I think either 3 or six months I like started sprinkling in some other other pieces I talked about how I eat and like Lea you know how Lea and I run you know being married and things like that and the the the problem is that you do get positive reinforcement from it and so it's like he made some stuff on relationships and then people were like oh this is awesome but the thing is is like the wrong people were saying it was awesome and so what was happening is my audience was growing but it was growing with the wrong people and so I had I mean I had this moment where
(22:18) like sometimes you have these like I had a a friend of mine come into a friend acquaintance I would say flew in and was like um he probably does 10 million bucks a year and uh and he was was like yeah you know um yeah I don't I don't listen to too much of your stuff anymore and he's like yeah I was Hardcore for like six years um and then I I just kind of um I guess it didn't really apply to me anymore he's like I guess I'm not really like your avatar and I was like you're 100 most [ __ ] Avatar like you
(22:43) are exactly who I'm going after and then I was like oh I'm a [ __ ] and I just basically it's like you you get you get it's a balance like you want to listen to customers but you also want to make sure you're listening to the right customers and so um I reoriented all my my content which maybe some of you guys have seen um and it's been 100% back to business has been the the theme that we have internally my guys now um is that if it's not business we don't make it just very straightforward like it can be business adjacent so like if I talk about you know prioritizing like tasks
(23:13) in my day that can have some element of productivity into it but it's like all my examples are going to be business related and so but by doing that when I looked objectively across metrics for site conversion opt-in Book Sales applications to the portfolio all of those metrics went up even though the average view per video went down and so it's like I'm not in this to get famous I'm in this to make money cool question um I wonder if anybody has I this might be for everybody but like has anybody done anything to when they do have a turned customer to get them
(23:44) back into being a customer or send a funny gift you just send a funny gift in a DM ask credit P you have you seen him yeah ask him for his message he's apparently got some message he DMS people with a funny gift and it gets people to reactivate just say it's like something like leaving so soon is kind of like the vibe is kind of yeah but you want to get the funny gift of course yeah and it's just within school yeah okay so no email SMS or anything like that our sales team has that for uh ghosted leads they have a Kevin Hart meme that's like I think that might be
(24:18) it I think that's what he's using yeah and uh yeah it like it gets higher response rates than any any message this is kind of for both of you probably you say as well definitely some um but I guess like when you're building you know a startup um obviously you know you might have sometimes you might have a little bit lack of capital A little lack of resources I guess how do you get a players to work for you and with you and how do you like structure comp structures and all that so it like the vision for the business has to be big enough that smart people can fit their dreams inside of it and so if you want
(24:53) brains then you need people who like they need to be able to believe that their dreams come true within your vision if it's again if it's like yeah we've just got a couple groups that we're running and we're making money then it's like that doesn't like really get me motivated if I'm intelligent I'm because like the best people have there's no lack of opportunity for best people they have tons like you have to think about this is It's a totally different game like you're if you're accustomed to taking people who are like
(25:18) I really want a job all of those people are irrelevant you have to be people who are like in some ways you're competing for them so the more you're competing for a prospect like selling them and so if you feel like like like I'll tell you the funny one is like if you're interviewing people where you're like sell me on why I should take you if you say that to somebody who's actually really talented they'll be like I'm good they just like they just don't like I you have to respond to this offer within 12 hours it's like okay I think
(25:49) you hit the nail right there for me like their Vision has to be our vision needs to be big enough for their dreams to fit into it you have to be able to say like what we want to do is we want to make music money into the standard for this and then they have to believe with a decent amount of certainty that it's possible and so like how you guys present like you are absolutely selling them and so like I think Drew this about on on a past one but everybody here understands you know lead generation lead nurture sales onboarding and then you know retention Ascension right
(26:19) that's the how you do with customers right this is the exact same process for an employee you generate applications you nurture applications the sale is the interview you onboard the employee and then either retain them or Ascend them it's the same thing and so you basically have to understand the acquis like this is when we get into scaling everyone's like two three people are like what's scaling is it's just where the inflow of talent into the business matches the inflow of customers into the business
(26:45) and you have to have an exceptional conversion process for attracting Talent this is where brand counts double it counts once on the front end for customers and again on the back end for talent and it becomes either a virtuous cycle or a vicious cycle either destroys your business you have a bad brand because what do you think what like what um like great talent will look at your reviews and be like oh this is yeah never mind it would work at a good place so I guess and last question I guess what what would be the best way to like
(27:13) acquire Talent as it just building a person or brand like in our field of work cuz I don't think it's necessarily like I can't I don't feel like I can find the right people on LinkedIn or something like that you know for what we're trying to do it needs to be people who are kind of like already kind of entrepreneurs or people were in more of like the sales or manager manager field it really depends on what role you're looking for but I can promise you that very smart people are on LinkedIn do you know how I um I I looked I got invited to speak at
(27:42) something and I looked at who else was speaking there and I saw hor mosy was speaking there and I was like all right there's my opportunity that was the first time we met in person yeah honestly so cool how long ago was that one year before I spoke about doing a deal m but you have to like be strategic sometimes yeah and then so you have to kind of do this old school networking thing which I [ __ ] hate because that's like the only time I've ever done that the whole deal was like the one deal to never do that again um but yeah you kind of have to do that I
(28:22) had to start going to like these software things I had to start to meet some software Engineers I had to learn about their world I had to ask people about why does what do you hate as a software engineer what do you like what makes a good company what makes a Bad Company you have to like learn everything about it and network and do that it really sucks honestly but if you're serious about it I knew there was no way I could build school without this person so I delayed starting it by a year just to find the person yeah so I was like I'm not even going to start until I find them like
(29:00) that's how essential I knew they were that's why I tell everyone to not do software it's just because the scale of how difficult it is to actually do it right is so hard that like no one basically no one does it right even when you know even if you know what you're doing most people can't do it and most people who are quote in the info world are like oh my info thing is INS salable so I'm going to build software and they just think that like white labeling go high level means they own a software company um like but I mean right and or they create
(29:30) some widget that someone else can duplicate in 5 seconds that they did off with an offshore developer that like if it actually did work then that developer would hold you Ransom and then what like they just don't play it out two steps and the code [ __ ] anyways and it's all it all sucks like yeah don't do it yeah and some were like you're just you don't want us to succeed that's why because you're you're doing so I was like no man I saw that Sam I put 5 years in it I was like great okay I saw the metrics I was like okay this is legit I SP all my money and it's still wasn't enough
(30:00) yeah I had to spend like twice that again yeah you guys for that too by the way that that's going to help a lot apprciate this for yeah I mean the personal brand thing is just good for recr like if you have one it's great it helps a lot um but at the end of the day if the if the if the business that you're trying to build solves a real problem and you really genuinely care about the problem if you find someone else who also cares about that problem they will be more likely to work with you like that's fundamentally it what do you sorry last question F what
(30:32) do you think about creating a an offer to train people to do what you are trying to eventually staff for like how I'm growing yeah like you know like in yeah you know training there was a point there was a point in time I had a closer program I was training closers and I was Staffing them you know what I mean and then I was I stopped doing that cuz there's so many closer training programs but right now I really need growth Partners people who can lead and manage our clients and kind of oversee everything what do you think about like I know there's a growth operator thing
(31:01) but they're not you know like in my mind like they don't have all the skill sets necessar what if someone you know created a program to train people I don't think you create another business to software role okay depends if it's like I know with a software engineer no one's going to be any decent in 10 years maybe a prodigy in six or seven but like there's just no shortcutting that like I mean my co-founder done 20 so the years matter and the same is true with a lot of things like there's just years so like but some other things might be different like setting okay yeah you can teach that closing yeah you
(31:40) can probably teach that but these more high level strategic things yeah that ain't happening like it took me [ __ ] 10 years like so are you going to wait 10 years no yeah it's it's like fundamentally every skill is trainable the question is whether it's worth the return on effort and the resources to train someone with it if you break things down enough you can train someone to do anything it's just that if someone lacks has zero meta skills they don't know how to read they don't know how to write they don't know
(32:10) how to talk you could teach someone to do all that stuff it's just why bother so I'd rather take someone who's already here and then just nudge them if I can with you know proper training that just Bridges the gap between all the skills they come in with and then applying that to my business you got it cool appreciate it yeah I mean the people's the reason that most internet marketers in general can't make money I'm sorry they they make money but they don't make like big money is that they just can't they can't they don't know how to operate people and that's
(32:40) usually because they need like a right hand a true right hand who can who's as good as them and like Lea will never get the credit that she deserves and that's fine um but like the reason that all of our stuff is so big is because she's so good at at building like she's an unbelievable Builder and so like the culture of the team is rockid I mean the guys will tell you like Lea really runs the like Lea runs acquisition.
(33:09) comom like I I really like she really does she does likea runs everything like I I mean I told you I have an empty calendar I can't have an empty calendar and and also have a business that's running unless someone else is actually doing it Lila takes 15 meetings a day she operates she's she's coordinating things between different departments she's checking on portfolio company she's having you know one want the people who having some sort of emotional breakdown about some craziness whatever um she handles all that with a smile you know what I mean and so but like I I I was we
(33:39) were talking earlier like I capped at $3 million a year and then when Leela came in 24 months later I took home 17 million in income net and so the difference was that she liked people and I tried to avoid them and that was the problem and so she her Leila's genuine Vision in life is to build a company that people love working at that's her whole like the whole reason that she like she gets up like her internal mission is to build a company that people love being at every day and so her vision just fits within
(34:13) my vision and so I recruited her to do it but like if we didn't do stuff that she liked we' like she wouldn't build it so I very much like especially the more talented the people that you bring on the more you like like they don't need pushing like they know what they're doing you just need to make sure that they're doing it in the direction and you kind of do this yeah the amount of training that you have to give some was is inversely portional to the skills that they come in with so the more spe basically the the less skilled the person the more specific the instructions Sam could basically just be like hey can you just promote school a
(34:47) lot and I'd be like yeah he's not like hey could you make these posts and write this copy and send these emails and run ads and make the hooks like this like that exchange has literally never occurred like I don't even know if Sam sees the ads before before they they go out he takes me the he was like when does the activation stuff come out and I said last Thursday no like for real like I already did it and then he was like I've seen this and I was like yeah I've already been thinking about that we've got something
(35:20) coming yeah like we don't even I've already thought about the next four things and we've got things ready so by the time we has the idea I'm like yeah we got it don't worry do your thing and then I'm like cool let me tell you what what I'm doing on the media side it's like oh [ __ ] great like these are all the things that I'm ramping up this the system we're putting in place like we changed our Cadence like things like that it's like oh dope I don't even want to think about YouTube so like if I had
(35:45) to tell him stuff oh my God like yeah but it's good to divide it like that cuz I can just focus on this stuff he can focus on that stuff Kirby can focus on his stuff we have very very good like division like that yeah the amount of Direction you need to give someone is inversely proportional to the skill they have yeah someone could just be like hey can you build this company and be like sure people will complain like if people it's always a sign of notice when people complain there's no communication have you has anyone had
(36:17) this as an issue um like with teams maybe a lot of you don't have teams yet but bad communication communication sometimes it's always the complaint yeah found it's interesting that one because you don't really need to communicate a whole lot when you get the right people like well mosy said like a couple of words and I was like don't worry I got it like what happen like right but sometimes if you hire the wrong person there's no amount of communication that can ever make it work and it's exhausting and it just still doesn't work I think I understood this I think I
(36:54) told this at one of the previous ones but how you know what a good culture is is this story of Google in the early days so Larry Page searched for something and the ads that showed up were not relevant to the words he typed in he took a screenshot he printed it off he got a red marker and he wrote These ads suck he walked over to the engineers and he pinned it up on the wall and he tapped it and one of them walked over and picked it Off the Wall stayed up all night that night and invented AdSense which is is their which has made them hundreds of
(37:32) billions chill so he didn't sit down with him and be like look I think you need to do this and this and this and maybe this he just said these ads suck right is that clear communication I mean to him it was no but that's what good talent is you can just be like this thing yeah do this yeah you don't even have to say do this you can say this sucks sort it out like and and then they'll they'll be on it or they might have already preempted what sucks cuz they've already been thinking about it so I always remember that when
(38:05) people say oh like you need more meetings or more communication like there wasn't a meeting first of all right there was there was slapping something on the wall yeah one of the most difficult things this is like I think this from an entrepreneurship perspective in terms of development is like has anyone here had another business before this yes okay did you achieve in this business what you achieved in your last business like in like from how long it took you to get to that level in your the business before versus how long it
(38:36) took you to get to that level with this business was it way faster and so a lot of the reasons is because you already beat the bosses up to that level so it's kind of like you're quickly retracing your steps and then you get to a level that you don't to your level of incompetence the difficulty the the thing that takes the longest in entrepreneurship is figuring out what good looks like at each level and it's one of those things that's really hard to translate like you see the billionaires on stage and they're just like I you know get great people and you're like sure but the thing is is
(39:06) that connecting what great people to them looks like in their mind and what you think great people are that is an ocean apart and so I mean I tell this story and Sam when I was talking about this last time but like I when we started meeting with private Equity firms uh to to to look at transacting with gym Lodge I we'd have these super long tables that were these board roomes and I'd see their team all the way on this side I saw my team all the way on this side and I would just kind of sit there and listen to like the questions that they were asking and the responses
(39:36) that my team had to be fair the team that we had had built $100 million do plus company pre covid obviously I sold during Co which actually hurt my valuation but not the point um so they built a $100 million company which is cool but when I saw this the town on this side I was like oh that's why these guys are going to make $3 billion over the next five years this team and it was such a stark contrast in terms of the level of talent again not disrespecting my team it was just such a difference that it was literally like after that immediately I was like my whole bar was
(40:06) just reset in terms of the caliber of the people that even existed in the world and everything was like how on Earth do I get those people to work for me and so like right now some of you have like one person who's like man I couldn't live without that person there's somebody who's literally 10 times better than that person that exists right now and it's just trying to figure out what you you need to do to get them on your team but the problem that takes so long is looking at what good talent in general looks like but even when it gets role specific like Sam
(40:36) had to do all this research to figure out like how do good software Engineers talk like what do they like what do they want and so some of you guys are at a point where you need to like start hiring a sales director or something like that like what happens is like this is the entrepreneur on know it looks like you bring someone on you talk to a bunch of people and then you're like I think this guy's good you bring him in and he sucks and that takes six months away from the growth that you would have had because your sales team and this guy sucked you put bad processes in then you got to fix the process you got to fire
(41:01) the people that guy hire cuz he sucked anyways and then you're like shoot I'm going to try again you bring the next guy in and then sometimes it happens again and you're like wow this sucked and then the third time and sometimes this takes a year or two years and then you're like I now know and you get lucky and you get one who actually works and you're like oh this is what a great sales director looks like and so the next time you go through your entrepreneur Journey like you go right to there and then you're like shoot I don't know what a good customer success person looks like and then you try again
(41:26) and so it's like however quick you can work through that so you can start recognizing the pattern of a what good looks like in general and then B what it what good looks like for a specific role that's how quickly you move through the levels that's been my experience with this and I wish I try and do everything I can to try and translate that into the stories that I tell with the content but sometime it's really tough because people like nod but like that is that is the secret sauce like that is it is being able to recognize like what a good
(41:52) growth partner looks like what a good even a good agency I've have good I have good agencies that we work with with now vast majority of them 95% of them are dog [ __ ] some of you guys run them so like that's that's that's that's the pattern recognition that's the highest value thing that you end up learning as an entrepreneur is what what good looks like

Transcript:
(00:00) five business lessons that I just learned crossing 250 million in 2024. So the first one was the cost of change. It was the first time that I've actually quantified how much does changing something in the business actually cost. So if you would imagine a straight line right and saying okay this is normal business activity right straight line is going across.
(00:25) Now let's imagine we want to change something right so that's like our normal revenue but then we decide you know what I'm going to change something in the business. So what ends up happening is this little line kind of dips down and I've estimated just for my kind of like this again there's no science behind this just my estimate that I get about a 20% decrease in effectiveness across any function that I'm going to change especially if it's manual.
(00:44) Now if you split test a headline that's different but if you're like hey we're changing our onboarding process or we're changing our sales process or we're changing our outbound process or we're changing our something that people are involved with um we tend to get a decrease immediately of 20% in a performance. All right, which is pretty significant.
(01:01) And so as soon as I realized that we had almost this guaranteed cost of change, which is about 20%, I was able to quantify what things were worth doing. Because if you're anything like me, I have like this big list of stuff where I'm like, man, we need to improve this. We need to improve this. We need to improve this. And I have all these ideas of things that I think that'll improve it.
(01:17) But when I actually am honest with myself and I think, huh, how much is number one going to actually improve the business? If I say, well, I think it maybe get us a 5% improvement. Well, if I have a guaranteed 20% decrease or decrement in performance and I have a 5% incremental increase in performance, do I want to take a 20% guaranteed loss to have a potential for a 5% gain? Probably not.
(01:40) And so, what's ended up happening is that there's all these little 5% 5% little improvements that I think could happen, but there's only like one or two 20 30 50% plus improvements I think we can do in the business. And so what happens is some of these things I just choose to never do.
(01:58) And I'll try not to stay explicit here, but some stays. You just have to accept that the business will not be perfect, but your chase of perfection will actually make your current business worse because you're constantly changing things. But let me let me spell this out one more level. So let's say you have your 20% loss, right? Now let's say you do something that is good, right? And it's you know up you start going up, right? 20% loss, it starts going back up.
(02:23) But what happens if you at the same time say, "Oh, well now I'm going to start changing something else." Right? And so basically, you incur this permanent 20% decrease because you're always changing something. So you're always 20% below where you should be in the business. 20% is a lot. Often times in the business, my business has done exceptionally well and I just let them breathe.
(02:40) Because here's the other part that no one tells you. If you change nothing, you get about a 5% guaranteed improvement. Think about how crazy that is. If you change nothing, you justupup 5%. You can book it. Think about GDP partially. Some people are like, "Oh, that must be uh, you know, that could be in relation to education, which in the US it certainly isn't.
(03:00) " It could be in relation to technology, in terms of GDP improvement, or it could be an increase because of population, which in the US there's no population increase or not really.
(03:12) For me, I just kind of see that across all businesses that if you just let people do stuff, they just get better at it, right? People get more efficient at it. I'll leave you one tactical framework that you can kind of use to think through this which is this is actually from the investing world that I've borrowed as an entrepreneur which is called ICE. All right. And so it's an acronym I stands for impact which is like how big that's that 20% that's that 50%.
(03:30) How big of an impact do I think this is going to make on the business? Right? If I had to make like if this works it's going to do this. The second is well how confident am I that it's going to work? That's the C which is what's my confidence level? So I got this big thing with low confidence or this medium thing with high confidence.
(03:47) I'll probably take medium with high confidence, right? And then the third is ease, which is going to come into a combination of how many resources are we going to have to deploy to do this? And also what's the timeline that we're going to have to do this on impact, confidence, ease. And so we actually do this like I have this massive sheet that it's called growth and I have it in all caps.
(04:04) And this is uh this is how I like how I get my add is I put it all on this list which will probably be the second big tactic is that I have every big idea that I want to try and I have to like get it out and spell it out and say all the things that I want to do and I just put it somewhere because the team can't handle the amount of ideas that I have and probably your team can't either. You have to just like scratch that itch in some way.
(04:27) I do it by documenting so I don't forget it and then whenever the team has more bandwidth I go back to that list and I'm like all right let's order this. which one has the highest impact? Which one do we think is going to work? Which one's going to be the easiest? We tabulate those together and we're like, "Okay, this is the one that we're going to try. This one we know has a 30% shot or a 50% chance increase.
(04:46) " That's basically thing number one. And it has I've tried to teach this down our portfolio and also what we do at acquisition.com is that you just need to be willing to leave some things not perfect so that the business can incur as few guaranteed costs of change. And when you are going to make a change, make sure it's worth it.
(05:10) So, so far, number one, we covered the cost of change, right? So, this is making sure that you are only taking bets that have 20% or higher upside to be worth the guaranteed cost that you're going to incur. And the framework that I use is ICE impact confidencees. All right, so that's number one. So, the second thing is I used to have this idea about the virality of products. So, I've talked a lot about referrals. I talked a lot about word of mouth. And I still obviously believe in that.
(05:32) But I would say that I've I've had this big pendulum swing in the very beginning of my career. Uh, you know, and especially if you're, you know, sub a million, you just got to promote, right? You just got to let people know about your stuff. No one knows you exist. You got to advertise, right? You got to learn how to sell. Cool. That's zero to a million.
(05:43) No questions asked. That's what it is. Now, to expand beyond that, I was like, okay, we kind of pendulum swing back to like we got to we got to make it super viral, right? Word of mouth is, you know, the best way to to grow a business. But I've thought more and more about this and I think that it's a it's an it depends answer.
(06:01) Now there are some products that you want for sure to have people who buy and then buy again that you want them to, you know, reoccur with you as in like if I buy a Coca-Cola product, I might buy, you know, a can today and I might buy a can at a restaurant later this week.
(06:17) And so it's like am I on a subscription? No, but I buy again and again and again, right? Or you have, you know, your internet which you just never cancel out of, right? Either of those are things that are recurring. They have high revenue retention. But that is different than virality, right? That's very different. So on one level you have does it stick? On the other level you have do people share it with other people.
(06:35) This is the nuance of understanding that's kind of shifted for me this year which is that some companies like especially B2B there's sometimes disincentives for a customer to bring in a competitor of theirs, right? If you service two types of similar businesses, uh they have a literally a disincentive to tell people about it. like they don't want anyone to know how you're helping them in whatever way.
(06:55) Right? So that's kind of like thing number one. You have like a negative pressure on word of mouth. The second issue is that not even if you didn't have negative pressure word of mouth, there has to be some sort of density in terms of the frequency of communication that your customers have with other potential customers.
(07:14) So, if I've got a guy who runs a a metal shop that specializes in aerote tech, for that guy to have very frequent communication with other aerotech companies that might use my software, my internal my internal tech or whatever it is that I that I help them with, why is he going to be talking to competitors? And if he is talking to competitors, like why would he want to share all my stuff? You can understand why sometimes it's not about word of mouth.
(07:33) And this is just a nuance of understanding that I would think is kind of my belief set is broken because I was very hardcore on like everything can grow on word of mouth period. But that's just not always the case. The gold standard should absolutely be revenue retention bar none. Full stop. And I can say that with absolute confidence.
(07:53) No matter what business you're in for B2B, your B TOC, you want to be able to get recurring or reoccurring revenue. But the virality typically is going to be more on the consumer side. So if you have a really good soda, you're you as a customer is not like, oh, I don't want to tell my friend that this soda is really good. You know, I've got this shirt. It finally fits me. Cool. Well, do I know other guys who are built more like me? Yes.
(08:09) Do I have high frequency of communication with them at least digitally? Yes. Okay, cool. So, I'm going to have there's some viral kind of coefficient there that goes in. And that applies to also consumer brands that are not tech. I want to be really clear about that.
(08:21) Like for those of you who have, you know, the drop shipping, e-commerce, retail products, it's like you still absolutely need to have word of mouth that grows the business. There are just some businesses that are just never going to have that. And for everybody, you want to retain. So, that was lesson number two. from a tactical perspective for that lesson.
(08:39) The big thing I would just want to measure is what percentage of customers that I have at the beginning of this year that 12 months later are still buying from me. That's the metric that we look at. We have a 100 customers at the beginning of the year and at the end of the year 50 of those people are still buying. So this is you know day zero or you know gen one whatever gen one and then December 31 how many of them are still buying? If I have 50 versus the 100 then I have 50% revenue retention. Now you can have logo retention which is a second nuance of this. Logo retention is of the 100
(09:07) customers do I have 50 customers or did I go from 100 customers to 25 customers but those 25 customers really like me and they now spend twice as much. So that's the difference between revenue retention and logo retention. For me we look at revenue retention because that's what we care about.
(09:25) It's like okay if we just know that these 50 now that they're in are just going to keep paying and potentially even growing between 50 to 100 next year. This is a monster business. This is what we look at and we obsess over in any business that we invest in. Now, no matter what, you might not have a viral product for word of mouth, but if you want seven different ways that you can generate word of mouth, inside of the $100 million leads book, I've got a whole chapter on referrals. And I took out the things that were the actual best ways that I have seen from a tactical
(09:48) perspective. So, I say I have six kind of thematic things are like these are things that you can do to your product to improve stick, to improve activation, to improve the number of customers who actually want to stay and continue to pay with you. And then on the other side, I have basically the tactics that I have seen work best for me and our businesses.
(10:06) And so these are things that actually drew in referrals. So I have this whole section on one side of referrals, two-sided referrals, how to ask for the at the right time. So timing is a huge component of it, how to run referral events, how to have ongoing referral programs, unlockable referral bonuses, seven different tactics that I've used work inside of the under million elites book. You can grab them somewhere on my site or on Amazon.
(10:26) Number two is making sure that the highest priority for the business is going to be revenue retention, not necessarily virality because not all products are meant to be viral. But if you are in a business that is consumer focused or something that doesn't have one a disincentive to share and a high frequency of interactions between your customers with one another, people who have basically high overlap so they talk to lots of people who could potentially buy a product. If these two things are you have a high disincentive and you have low frequency, then you're just not
(10:55) going to have virality in the product and you don't have to worry about it. But if you do, then obviously you want to have both. Number three, I've been very obsessed with the concept of LTV to CAC.
(11:08) I've talked about it a lot, which is basically how much does it cost you to customer versus how much money you get from that customer over the lifespan, specifically in gross profit, not lifetime revenue. Now, the reason I I like to always delineate this and I say LTGP, which is a mouthful, is because most of the literature that exists on LTV, so lifetime value for a customer, how much they pay you in gross profit over time, is typically written in the software world. And software tends to be virtually 100% gross margins in most businesses.
(11:31) Many businesses look at that literature and then say, "Oh, well, let me just say someone stays with me for 10 months, they pay $100 a month, therefore my lifetime value is $1,000." Well, that's only true if you sell information media or software, something has zero incremental cost. But a lot of businesses don't have that.
(11:52) If you sell chocolate chip cookies and the cookies cost you $20 for each of those $100 shipments, I mean, these are expensive cookies, but let's just go with it. So, this cost you 20 bucks for every $100 shipment, your lifetime value is not $1,000. So, we have our hundred bucks, right? Times 10 months. That's the revenue.
(12:13) What we're looking at is $80 because we have to take out the 20 in cost times the 10 months, which actually equals $800, which is our real lifetime gross profit, which in the business world sometimes people refer to as CLV or LTV. They all more or less mean the same thing, which is how much money you going to get from the customer. Now, I put this as a frame for the big lesson that I had, which is in the software world, the big rule of thumb is 3 to one.
(12:34) That's the big rule of thumb. I actually now having worked with a lot of different businesses, invested different businesses, I think there's nuance to it. So, let me explain. This is actually pretty cool. So, there's three components to a business that I I think influence that number. So, you have the attraction component, which is, you know, the advertising.
(12:51) How are we advertising? How we getting people in? How are we letting them know? How are we generating leads? Then we have the conversion, whatever your sales motion is, right? Sales. And then finally, you've got delivery, right? Or fulfillment. How are we going to get people whatever they whatever they chose to pay for? Right? So, if we have these kind of three functions, the extent to which you need to have high LTV to CAC is predicated on how manual each of these processes is. So, let me explain. If you have paid ads, which I would
(13:21) consider uh very high leverage and very like one person could write a gazillion dollars of paid ads, high leverage. Cool. That's number one. If we had a conversion process that's through a checkout page, so it's automated, then that's going to be something else that's going to give us leverage.
(13:39) Okay? And then third is let's say that we have software as our backend that has unlimit like we have no supply limitations. There's no logistics limitations and pretty much it just works. If you're in one of those businesses, then you absolutely can be at 3:1 LTV to CAC over long haul. Fine. You could even be at, you know, 1.5 to one.
(13:56) I mean, it wouldn't be ideal, but depending on the size and scale, you could still make money doing it. put $100 in, get 150 back, do it over and over again. If that's only true for them, what is it for a construction business? What is it for a a plumbing company? What is it for an e-commerce business? The other extreme, I'm going to just paint the extremes and you can kind of understand the middle.
(14:16) If I had instead of paid ads, I had manual outbound, so outreach or whatever you want to call it, outreach, reaching out to people one-on-one with the team. And then from a conversion process, I've got one-on-one sales. And then from a delivery process, I've got call it, you know, concierge, one-on-one or even many to one services, then I'm going to want an LTV to CAC ratio that's going to reflect that.
(14:41) For me, if I had a business like this, and this is going to shock some of you, but just bear with me. I'm going to want this thing to be like 20 to1 or more. Now, some of you guys are like, there's no way it's impossible. I would say I've made the material the vast majority of the material wealth in my life at 30 to1 or higher and I've done it multiple times and during those periods of time is when a lot of the basically the wealth that I've accumulated has come in but in the times in between instead of trying to scale something that's at you know 5 one or 8 one I'm just going to
(15:11) continue to tinker I'm going to start I'm going to stick with my one location I'm going to keep working on the model and just keep tinkering with it until eventually we get the economics that we need in order to scale what if I'm doing paid ads ads, but we do one-on-one sales and we sell media or information or something like that, then it's like then you're going to be somewhere in between.
(15:29) But I have this as my rule of thumb is that the 3:1 only matters at the companies that have 100% scale, 100% leverage across all three components here. If you have manual cost all three, you're going to be at I would at least want to be at 20 to1. I shoot for 30 plus. A lot of people can't even believe that. Fine. So, you know, fit it to whatever your goals are.
(15:52) I really do believe that you can just keep tinkering with the business, keep tinkering in the offer and find a way to get it so that you can have a huge discrepancy between these two numbers because that's what allows you to scale. If you want to scale a business that's more manual, which if some of you guys are listening, 78% of businesses in America are are service- based businesses. So, this applies to you. As you go into colder and colder markets, you will convert a smaller percentage of customers.
(16:09) These are customers who are less likely to purchase from you, but you have a bigger pool of people. So, that's kind of the trade-off. But when you go to those colder colder markets, smaller percentage convert, meaning it costs you more to get those customers. Basically, you sell more people.
(16:21) You're going to have more infrastructure that has to get built into the business. So you have layers of management that will start costing you and not necessarily always be alpha. They're not going to be value additive. With these two things that are working against you, you have to have this very large discrepancy between what it cost you to get a customer and what you're going to make from that customer in order to weather that storm and allow you to kind of grow into that sh.
(16:38) You can almost like grow into your LVD CAC, which is kind of how I think about it. So, if you're thinking about this for you, number one, know what your true LTV to CAC is and make sure you're doing it off gross profit, not off of revenue. And then number two, if you want to scale, make sure that it your your LTV to CAC ratio is appropriate for the level of leverage that you have within your existing business across all three functions. So, you might be wondering, why doesn't the ratio still cover it for
(17:05) a supermanual business versus a business that's entirely automated? The main reason is lumpiness. You have to bring people in for outbound that are not going to be proficient. So, you're gonna have to incur the cost of new SDRs that either aren't going to work out at all or aren't going to work out in the beginning and then eventually going to work out. So, you have to incur that cost.
(17:24) But imagine incurring that cost and then also incurring the cost of new salespeople who actually going to be trying to convert those prospects and they're going to suck and they're going to lose opportunities and you're going to be paying them while they literally close fewer sales for you. So, you lose twice. And then also sometimes you spend all this money and time to get them hopefully to be proficient and then they aren't. So, they just lost you money three different ways.
(17:42) The third uh component of this is the delivery piece, which is like, okay, I'm going to have to onboard and hire all of these other people. And if you have anything that's like higher expertise, then forget about it. It's going to take even longer for you to both find these people and then also to train these people up. But again, recruiting itself can be a super expensive task.
(17:59) Like there's recruiting firms. And if you want to recruit a high level person, it usually cost you 25, sometimes 30% of their first year pay. And if you're paying someone $300,000 a year, it's like you're going to pay 80 grand just to get somebody, let alone hope that they're proficient. And you still have all this onboarding.
(18:16) So you have this lumpiness of of people that aren't going to be effective. And if you at 3:1, boom, you're done. Like it's there's no like that 3 to1 disappears real fast. It's like you have this lumpiness of like, okay, boom, we got these new SDRs in cra like now this is coming back up, but then this starts growing down.
(18:33) So now like we start at 20 to1 or 30 to1, but it's like we kind of it's more like a wave. like it it undulates with the efficiency of the business and how stable it is as you're scaling. And the faster you're scaling, the more inefficient it's going to be. So that's why you need to have as much as you can in terms of LTV to CAC. It's padding. The third piece here is that we just went over it LTV to CAC.
(18:51) One, we want to make sure that we're doing this off of gross profit, not revenue. And secondarily, we want to make sure that if we are highly leveraged, then we can be at 3:1. But if we're low leverage, we want to be at 20 plus, you know, 21 or higher. And again, this sounds crazy and unrealistic for a lot of people. I get it. Fine.
(19:09) At the very least, be at 15 to one. Please, for the love of God, I promise you it's possible. You just have to work on it longer than you expect. Which brings us to number four. Let's dive into it. Number four. I've thought I've said a lot about this, which is that the 1 to 3 million area is a huge swamp, right? We call it the swamp, at least at acquisition.com. and why is 1 to3 million so hard? Now, we've we've noticed that it's hard.
(19:33) But we were like, why is that range hard? Now, for those of you who are like, this is not real for me. I'm just trying to make my first $10,000 a month. Just keep listening because believe it or not, some of these things will apply to you. So, if you're at 1 to $3 million, why is this one of the hardest periods? Because usually from 0 to a million, you can usually do it with like you and two, three people. It's not that hard for you to keep track of the team. You can usually run very high margins, especially if you're a sole proprietor.
(19:57) You're basically just selling your time, which is fine, right? You don't need to obsess about your passive income before you max out your active income. Good idea. By the way, a lot of billionaires, very high active income, FYI. Anyways, as you're scaling up, that first, you know, 500, 800, sometimes million dollars a year is actually in some ways somewhere more profitable than the next 2 3 4 million because you have to install this level of infrastructure because you're like, I just can't do it anymore. Now, you can always just keep
(20:21) jacking prices and that's fine and I'm a big advocate of that. But if you're like, "No, I think this is the price that I want to service at and I want to do more volume." Then you're going to have to put put in more infrastructure. But this is the math that I just realized is why it's so hard.
(20:34) So let's say you've got a a $2 million business. You're right in the middle of the swamp. Okay? And you probably noticed anecdotally for those of you who are kind of like in this business world, there's a lot of people in the 1 to3 million range. Like a ton ton of businesses. To be fair, doesn't mean they're making$1 to3 million in profit, which means they're doing 1 to three million in revenue. Big difference.
(20:52) All right. But let's say we've got a $2 million business, okay? And let's say that they're doing 20% margins. All right? So they're doing $400,000 per year in eBay or profit. Okay? So we got $400,000 here. Now, here's the stick. At this point, for the business to evolve, for the business to level up, the entrepreneur typically has what I would consider an impossible choice. You have to choose one of two things. And sometimes the option is both, which is path one.
(21:21) instead of getting more help, I'm just going to work even more. I'm going to go from, you know, 12 hours a day to working 16 hours a day. I'm going to stop taking weekends off and I'm going to basically get through this hump so I can push my way to $10 million a year, which you can do. It is hard.
(21:40) Or I'm going to bring in somebody who's going to help me get there and I'm going to maintain a relatively long schedule, but still, you know, not the same as working 16 hours, 7 days a week. Those are the kind of the two impossible choices, which is like other person. Here's the tough part.
(21:57) If you have $400,000 in profit that's left over, if you want to bring in a stud who's going to really help you there, you're probably going to be looking at $250,000 per year in all-in comp kind of at a minimum to bring somebody who's a real star into the business. Let's look at that in comparison to what the profit is for this business.
(22:15) You're looking at risking more than half of your income on one person with the hopes that it's going to work out. But what happens when this person comes in and then they aren't that good? They don't expand your capacity. It's like, well, shoot, I just lost half my profit for a year and then I'm still not further along. This is why this is the swamp. And I and I I've just spent a lot of time thinking about that because I was like, why is one to $3 million so hard? You need the help, but you don't have the money to afford the help. And so, you either just got to go overdrive and go nutso mode, right? or you make a huge bet proportional to what
(22:43) you have in terms of net profit to bring this person in. And that's why it's so hard. And so, if you're in the swamp right now, my encouragement to you is this. I have almost always been the like I'm going to go into overdrive and I'm going to hire the person because the idea is what if I just do things that are more unscalable but still generate higher profits for the business so that I can afford to take two or three shots with somebody else who's coming into the business knowing that I'm not going to
(23:11) hit it out of the park on the first shot. I mean, if I do, I'm stoked, but I want to win either way. And so either I'm going to win with more profit faster or less profit slower, but I want to make sure that I'm guaranteed to win. I kind of do this as a plus scenario.
(23:28) So if you happen to be in that 1 to3 million range, it's something that we know obviously a lot about with acquisition.com and we put together a scaling road map. So when we looked at our whole portfolio and the companies that we worked with over the years, we're like what are the things where do we get stuck and how do we get unstuck, right? And when we put it all together on a map, what we realize that it actually isn't by revenue, it's by headcount. You might be doing $1 to $3 million a year and be here, or you might be doing $1 to $3 million a year and be at level five product size, right? So,
(23:52) it really depends on the nature of the business that you're in. If you want to know what level of the scaling revup you're at, and more importantly, what things we've done in the past for businesses of this size or at this stage to get to the next level, then you go to acquisition.com/roadmap.
(24:08) You put in your business information and it'll spit out and it'll help you figure out which stage you're at so that you can get to the next level. On the thank you page, if you would like our team to help figure out which stage you're at and those specific steps and personalize that, we'd love to invite you out to Vegas. You can book a call on the next page and if it's a fit, love to see you.
(24:27) And then the fourth thing we just covered is why 1 to 3 million is the hardest. And the main thing is is cash flow and time. you don't have the time and you don't have the cash flow to do more work, but you have to in order to grow. So, either you work overtime or you bring someone else in to work overtime or you do both, which is what I recommend.
(24:44) And that means it's going to be hard, which is why most people stay stuck. So, that's number four. Number five, so 2024 was probably the first year that I didn't have FOMO. So, fear of missing out. It is the hardest part of business is staying focused. It's the hardest part.
(25:04) The reason you you hear Bezos talk about it, you hear you hear Zuckup talk about it, you hear Jobs talk about it, you hear Elon talk about it, like you have to be incredibly focused on what the points of greatest leverage are in the business. The reason that this was a big lesson for me, not the focus part, I obviously talk about that, but I was like, why why was this year different? Why was this the first year where I didn't have FOMO? It's actually because the idea of rush is where the fear of missing out comes from. It's the arbitrary timeline that I set for myself that I just grab from thin air and then
(25:31) I measure myself against this thing that I made up to make myself miserable at all times from whatever success I'm achieving. In thinking about that, I I have I've coined the term for myself, which is that rush is imaginary. It's made up. It's completely made up. There's only one caveat that I'll make to this, which is, and if this is you, you probably already know.
(25:53) If you have a business that has a tremendous network effect and there's a very small amount of people, even a big amount of people in that network that you're trying to gather towards, then yes, it's likely that you have a winner take all business model and in which case you've probably already raised a ton of money and you're probably trying to aggressively grow to capture that network so that eventually you can turn something into a profitable business. Fine.
(26:12) For everybody else who's not running a tech platform that's trying to build a network effect of some sort, you don't need to rush. There was uh Anie, actually I don't think her her her episodes come out yet, but anyways, I'm going to give you a sneak peek. So, I was talking to Anie Trrog and she has um she has nail salons, okay? And so, she has uh one core nail salon that worked really well and then she decided to partner with other people doing like three or four other nail salons.
(26:38) And the biggest issue she has for growing right now is that her partnerships are kind of a mess. I'll just put it like that. Why did you do these partnerships? She said, "Because if I had more locations, I'd make more money.
(26:50) " And I said, "Why didn't you just make more money with your existing location, save up the cash, and then open a second location all for yourself?" The thing that I kept trying to tease out of her is I was like, "She was just in a rush." Like, that was the reason. She was just in a rush. There's no actual reason for have three or four other different random partnerships with each of these locations. And the thing is is that some of you guys are you do this.
(27:09) There was a guy who was here at our headquarters yesterday. He has a Tik Tok shop management thing, right, where he just like helps people start their their Tik Tok shops for e-commerce businesses. And he was like, "But I also have this brand that I started on my own using Tik Tok shop and it's doing really really well, but I also want to start investing in I'm like, dude, what's the rush?" And so the counteraction, like how do you how do you counter the rush? How do you counter the rush? And I think the way that I have countered the rush is to look at the people who have the ultimate version of my business. Who are the
(27:39) people who are 20 years ahead of me? What do their businesses look like? And what's interesting about this is that the vast majority of them have one massive business. And in seeing that, I was like, huh, almost none of them have multiple massive businesses they started.
(27:57) Elon is, of course, the one exception that everybody wants to bring up. And if you're Elon, you alreadying know how to speak alien, so don't worry about this video. But for everyone who doesn't know how to speak alien, right? for people who haven't just generated a hundred billion dollars in a year. If you if you haven't done that yet, then maybe consider every other person on the Forbes list that just did one thing for the entirety of their career. And it's like Basos has Blue Origin. Yeah. After 35 years of Amazon, you've got Mr. Panda still doing.
(28:24) It's like, but wait, he owns he owns the Cosmo. Yeah, but he also did that after 45 years of Panda Express. And Panda Express is still his cash cow. Okay, I've got this restaurant. It's working well. Awesome. Think about starting this agency, right, for to help restaurants. It's like, dude, what does the ultimate version of this look like? The ultimate version of this look like either you go all in and you build an enterprise agency that only works with very large restaurant chains and those tend to be sticky and those tend to be valuable businesses. But if you're like, well, I'm only dealing with small SMB restaurant owners for my agency. Show me
(28:56) one one agency that service SMBs in that,000 $1,500 maybe $2,000 a month mark who has a $100 million plus business. Even just re like revenue. Just show me one. Why doesn't it happen? Because it's a bad model. Every single agency goes up market and they serve enterprise and that's become really big. Look at Ogulvie. Look at Veayner, right? Like look at Neil NP digital.
(29:22) All of these are massive massive companies that only service really the Fortune 500. Why? because they're sticky. Because if you have volatile customers, you'll have a volatile business. If you have a volatile business, you're not going to be able to weather the storms. If you can't weather the storms, you're not going to last long. If you don't last long, you're not going to get big.
(29:38) How do you counteract the idea of rushing? You have to look at the end state of the business. What is the ultimate version of my restaurant look like? It might be 2,000 locations nationwide. What does the ultimate version of my agency look like? It might be Oglev and Matters, right? It might be we're doing five billion dollars a year. And let's look at the number one person in the space.
(29:56) If what does the ultimate version of my lawn care business look like? Maybe it's a franchise. Maybe it's you privately hold it. But no matter what it is, it's probably not three different businesses that you're trying to say start all at the same time because you're in a rush. Because the thing is is that rush is what guarantees you're never going to get big.
(30:12) And I'm saying this because this is something that has plagued me my whole career. And so just this last year was the first year that I didn't have FOMO. And I was like, why is that? And I just think that I've just failed and messed it up enough times to be like, I just have to stick with one thing. And here's the up part about this.
(30:32) You have to accept that you you can't sleep with every girl. You can't date every guy. Whatever it, you know, whatever your your your preference is. The point is our life is so limited. It's just so we just don't have that many. We don't have that much time. If you want to do big stuff, you just don't have that much time because of that.
(30:47) It's like you just have to accept the fact you just got to pick. And you could have had four other timelines where you could have done each of these other things all the way to their extreme. But the likelihood that you're going to do all four of those to the extreme when you start all four of them at the same time is zero. It's not going to happen. The first business is built on hard choices.
(31:05) Business is built on the amount of nos that you're able to make if you can't say no at the beginning of like I'm not going to just pick one of these paths. Right? One of my favorite little definitions of d uh deciding comes from the Latin decaderee which means to cut off. Like if you want to decide, you have to cut off, you have to eliminate things.
(31:25) If you have three different paths or four different things that you're considering, pick for the love of God. And the reason and the thing is is that you have made up some number because some person you know makes a certain amount of money or some person you know thinks that this amount of revenue is cool. And so you're like, why would it be cool? So I want to hit that amount of revenue.
(31:42) And because you don't know how to grow the business you're in, you only know how to get to $100,000 a year. You only know how to get to a million a year. Only know how to get to $3 million a year. Then your way of growing is doing more $3 million businesses. When the reality is that you have to confront, why is my $3 million business not a $10 million business? And you have to figure out that problem. That is the hard work. I talked to a lady yesterday. She was stuck at a million dollars a year for 10 years.
(32:01) I I said, "Why haven't you gone to to to $3 million a year? Like what's what's stopped you?" Because she had a very clear model. I was like, "Why don't you just double how much you're doing?" And she was like, "Well, it's a pain." And I was like, "Oh, cuz it's hard." Cuz it's hard. She's like, "No, no, it's not cuz it's hard.
(32:17) " And I was like, "Well, then why haven't you done it?" And she's like, "Well, it's just like it's just like it's inconvenient and there's like it's more it's more time aotment and all this stuff." And I was like, "Yeah, that sounds like hard. Sounds like hard. It's hard for us to hear that we're not willing to do hard things because the hard changes." So the heart is constant, but the nature of it changes. Just like suffering as a human being is constant.
(32:35) It's not going to go away. There's nothing wrong with you because you're suffering while you're in business. It's just that the nature of the suffering changes. In the beginning, no one knows you exist and that's tough because you feel ignored and irrelevant. And then you start to let people know about your stuff.
(32:48) And then as soon as that happens, you have a different kind of hard which is that no one wants to give you money. And then all of a sudden people start giving you money. And then what happens? Then people start complaining because your thing's not that good. But all of these things are hard.
(32:59) And so we have this idea that it's this rocky cut scene that we're going to be we're going to be fighting. It's like we got to just keep gritting through it. But it's like no, we are so equipped to save our egos that we will come up with a hundred ways that our heart is not hard. It's different because we're special, right? But the reality is hard morphs.
(33:19) That's what makes people get stuck is because they learn how to conquer one hard but not the next kind of hard. I think that a lot of the hardness is is sometimes learning to say no. It's learning to focus. That's the hard part. It's not getting punched in the face. It's it's being willing to let one of your children die to let the other one live. We get the Sophie's choice.
(33:38) We actually do have to do that in business all the time. And so you have to accept that there is a life in the future that you will not be able to live. And it's actually it's honestly it's acceptance. And it's this has just been a re a really good lesson for me which is like there are opportunities that I think I could crush and I think they're amazing.
(33:55) And you know what? I'm never going to be able to do them because I still have the one that I'm working on right now and I have to continue to say yes to this. And by saying yes to this, I have to say no to everything else. These have been the five the five big business lessons that I've uh kind of learned more recently and I thought you might enjoy them. have an amazing day.

(00:00) wasting money sucks and in 6 months I saved one of our portfolio companies $2 million in bottomline profit and I'm going to show you the problems they were suffering from the solutions we did and takeaways you can use in your business today to increase customer satisfaction decrease refunds get more people to buy your next thing or upsell and decrease the dreaded charge back enjoy so this business was a SAS business which just stands for software as a service and we had just implemented this software in the business 90 days earlier and so we
(00:31) had a big spike in churn decreased customer satisfaction scores decreased number of people who are taking the next upsell and other problems and so the first problem that we wanted to attack was onboarding meaning what does a customer do immediately after they buy now if you don't have onboarding I can tell you right now if you add onboarding you will significantly make customers happier and you'll get them to stay longer and pay more so if you're not doing it start there now let me tell you the problems with the onboarding is it currently existed so within onboarding there were five main problems and I'm going to start with the first one first
(01:05) off it was one to many so there were 25 new customers per call so you imagine you buy this thing you get an email they say hey schedule your onboarding call you schedule the call you hop on and then you're like wait there's a whole bunch of other people here and then when you're on the call the actual stuff that they were going over was really Broad and kind of company based it was like this is our mission this is our vision this is what we're trying to do these are our Founders this is our story all the stuff that customers don't care
(01:29) about next uh from a value perspective they were having to do like a third of the call was helping people like reset their passwords for the software because they couldn't figure it out this is an older demo which I'll talk about a little bit later uh so this is a 55 plus average demo Avatar meaning these are older folks who are doing a technology business so we need to have way more handholding I'm already sh a little bit of some solutioning all right so they were spending all their time resetting passwords and talking about really broad stuff and at the very end of that one to many call they were then kind of hard
(02:05) pitching the upsell right and so if someone didn't take that offer there was no next steps for them to take so it's basically like hey you bought this thing hey we're going to tell you about the company oh yeah let's spend a third of this call helping individual people fix their individual passwords and then at the end hey you should buy our next thing and people say well I don't want to buy that and then they say good luck this is a big company and in some ways you can take says if you do the right things right you can still get a lot of
(02:34) things wrong and be successful and this is a new product and so I want to highlight this is that especially if you have a large customer base and you start a new thing you're usually going to have a huge on you know inflow in the beginning that causes your infrastructure to break because if you were to sustain that level of sales flow as then you get thousands of customers to all start every day then your infrastructure would be bigger but it doesn't make sense to hire a 100 reps just for 3 days and then fire them all and so some of these problems are due to
(03:03) scale and the nature of releasing a new product in general lots of large companies have it happened that's why there's lines out the door at Apple that's the idea okay so that was series of problems number one if you have a service or you have a software notice how they're very similar onboarding is the first real touch point with the customer and customers make their first impression of your business from the 24 to 48 hours post purchase meaning everything that happens until then frames the entire rest of their experience with you and so nailing that
(03:33) next 24 48 hours will increase how many people take your upsells how long they stay so literally like adding onboarding can add 2 three months to your LTV if you have any kind of recurring service and so right now if you're not doing it or just sending like an email with some lists on it you're missing a massive Revenue opportunity so the first thing we did to fix this onboarding process was we ran a pilot so to be clear we didn't say hey let's break the entire business yet again so we took 15% of new customers and put them through a
(04:01) different onboarding process to test whether this new onboarding process yielded better results than the current one so what we did was we went from one to many to one onone now obviously part of the reason that we rolled this out slowly was because we didn't have the bandwidth to take on 25 new customers every hour which is what we were doing here we had one person doing six or eight calls with 25 customers each every single day and so to scale that team it would have taken a lot of time and we definitely weren't going to risk it until we've proven it out so that's the
(04:32) first thing we did the second thing we did in the pilot is we actually followed the closer framework which is a sales framework like wait how does that apply to onboarding well guess what once someone makes a purchase the last R of closer is reinforce the decision and so that actually applies to onboarding and so when you reinforce the decision what we do is restate the c l and O again so we say hey clarify why they're there label them with a problem and then overview their past experience and then you're selling them again on the
(05:01) vacation on what they're going to experience as a result of their past decision of buying now from a value perspective first off establishing the goal and reminding them of the goal that they had is massive and so I want to like look at you in the camera right now when we had Allen our software company and we simply changed the language that we onboarded people with so we actually had a similar onboarding process but we just said hey I know you said you wanted to make $10,000 a month extra with your agency or whatever but why do you want that now they say oh well I want to make
(05:33) this impact or I want to retire my wife or I want to whatever the thing is when we related them taking the next steps to the goal that they had stated it doubled or tripled I can't remember the number it was a lot how many more people followed through because we said we want to help you with that John we want to help you retire your wife and these next three things are going to help you do that and then they were like oh that's the reason I signed up and I am going to follow through from the low value version of this where I was like let me just listen to everybody resetting their passwords we could give someone a
(06:04) one-on-one coner experience of walking them through setting up their password correctly because is a very low technically proficient audience that we were dealing with so we would get them a quick win so if this is you for your business you want the quick win which was getting their login set up properly and showing them around the software now here's the interesting part if for whatever reason something came up during the on on boarding call we would immediately connect them with support so we could get it handled on that call and so that way at the end of every call for onboarding the people were live they
(06:39) were set up they were logged in and they understood the basics of how to use the software to get the goal that they signed up for part of you is like wait so you did the one: one you added the Clos in the front of this you got a quick win for them okay but what about the sales like this is cute Alex but what about the money I know I'm just a bleeding heart and doesn't don't want to make money uh no I'm here to make money I'm an investor I own this company I want this to go big right so what we did and this is the interesting part if you already are a business owner and you like this
(07:09) more in-depth stuff we have workshops that we just started uh offering at acquisition. comom at our headquarters in Vegas um and so if you want to see if you qualify for one of those uh you can go to acquisition. comom hit scale hopefully we'll talk to you then is that we found that when we had this one-on-one experience that restated the goals and all this stuff guess what happened we went from 20% of people ascending from from the old process to 48% of people taking the Ascension offer so this is one of the things that has
(07:38) taken me a very long time to learn which is when you're persuading a big part of the value equation and if you don't know the value equation four variables dream outcome perceive likel of achievement time delay effort and sacrifice how dialed and how tight your business is before you ask for money is a huge boost to the perceived likelihood of achievement and so if everything that I've said to you up to this point I've overd delivered on and I've delivered on time and made an exceptional experience for you and I've given you the quick
(08:13) wins I reminded you while you were here you've got somebody one1 who's got your full attention then when I make the next offer you feel like it's very likely that I'm going to continue to do business the same way I already have and so the best way to get someone to expect that they're going to get value in the future is provide value today so the tldr is we didn't need to be nearly as sales heavy because the quality of the service was so much higher that they said yeah if this is a taste of what I'm
(08:38) going to get later I want way more of that and let me give you a pro tip right now if you're not sure what to upsell on the back of anything there are two upsells that work in almost any business that I buy and I've seen across the zillions that I look at more of that thing you just bought or more help with that thing you just bought so people bought a thing and if you're like why I don't want to upsell them immediately well they bought it so they probably want more of it or they want more help with that thing they just bought and so you can get huge uptakes on UPS sales immediately
(09:12) after someone makes a first purchase let me give you a little tip so most small business owners are afraid of asking for too much right they're like hey this person just bought for me I don't want to seem pushy I don't want to make more offers but if you believe in what you sell and someone has a problem then it's my belief that you have an ethical duty to present them the offer you don't have to hard close them but you should let them know that you've made this offer or this solution available to them because
(09:36) buying the way most people think about it is that people buy on these regular intervals but that's actually not the case at all what happens is someone has a problem and then in a very short period of time they make all their purchases and then they make almost none so think about it this way if I wanted to start running a marathon what would I do I'd sign up for a marathon and then I'd be like oh shoot I need Marathon shoes so then I go to the shoe store and buy Marathon shoes and I be like you know what I don't have any running shorts I only have the shorts that are
(10:05) basketball shorts so I need to get some running shorts so I buy running shorts then i' be like I gotta go one of those tank tops okay oh you know what I have an iPod but I don't have an arm sleeve for it so it's going to fall out oh are there headphones that are better for running so it doesn't fall out of my head now the small business owner most people watching this say wait I only sell shoes I don't want to offer them shorts and a tank top and headphones but guess what Susie's going to do she's going to go take all of this after you made the hard sale of getting her to
(10:33) sign up for a marathon and she's going to go to the guy down the street because he's a real business owner and he's like hey she's in a buying window she's in a hyper buying frenzy and we need to capitalize on it in that moment now How likely is it after she's bought all that stuff now Adam the average business owner he's like hey now that you've been running for 30 days do you want an iPod case and she's like well dude I've been running for 30 days I already got it from uh above average Andrew down the street he already sold me all the stuff I need thanks and guess where she's
(11:03) going to go from here on out the guy who sold her the most stuff most businesses have some sort of shift that happens in someone's identity when they make a purchase they say I'm an author now I'm an investor now I'm a runner now I'm a marketer now I'm a whatever insert the thing that you help someone I'm healthy now I'm a fitness person now you have these transitions where someone steps into a new identity and then there's all these other behaviors and other products that go along with that identity and so we want to explain that and enable our
(11:32) customers to buy those thing from us the moment they make that decision because it actually is more congruent with what you set in the expectations if I said hey I'm going to help you become a marathon runner and then I only have shoes to sell them then I probably didn't really believe that much in the fact that they were really becoming a marathon runner so they now believe you you've sold them on this dream this new identity they could get into back it up so we've already made some massive improvements to this onboarding process but what's the last thing we did well before this there was no next steps we
(12:03) were like sayara hope you buy again in the future and if not you're dead to us not really I say that to exaggerate but there's three things we did to improve this last part so the first thing we did was we gave them a summary of the experience and we let them know in the beginning hey don't worry you don't have to take notes we're taking notes for you and we're going to send them to you at the end of this call that way you can be fully present and paying attention and that way you can think about the
(12:27) questions you could that you want to ask while I'm here rather than being worried of like oh I didn't get that so number one puts them at ease two they're going to get all the best notes because we're going to take notes for them the second thing is we gave them tutorials and so say Hey you are interested in these components of our software because not all customers want the same things from your service or your product you say okay you're especially interested in these three items cool so what I'm going
(12:50) to do on top of walking you through it right now is I'm actually going to give you a link to these three tutorials in those notes that I send you that way you can refer back to them without me necessarily having to click through it again uh so that if you get stuck you can just follow along but it's specific to the things that that person said clarify whether they label them with a problem in the beginning of the call that was aligned with their goal the third thing we did was okay we've given you the notes we're giving you the how-tos and if for whatever reason you have a problem we give you a point of contact so you've got a PC you've got a
(13:20) point of contact that this person that I'm going to introduce you to live on the call so you make FaceTime you understand who it is and now from this point going forward this is called a Baton Pass and so if you think about this from a business no one should ever fall into no man's land so this is what we like to call bamfam and I got this from Chiron svat is a good friend of mine which is bamfam is book a meeting from a meeting bamfam is a way of life no customer should ever not be bam Pam they should always know when the next time they're going to talk to you is
(13:50) never get off a call being like yeah yeah and then we'll coordinate the next thing you're both there pull up your calendars pick the time get it done now with bam famam that means that the sales guy hands the Baton over to the onboarding person they know when they're going to be talking to them then the onboarding person baton passes to the support person or the account rep who's going to be managing the account on the ongoing basis and so at all times notice three different people touched the account but at no point did they have multiple points of contact so we had multiple people who touched them but in
(14:22) the beginning it's sales rep John and then next one it's onboarding Oly and then it's account rep Alex right and so every point that person knows who they're going to talk to until that person hands the Baton to the next person so the second bucket of problems was expectations and so one thing people said was this is way too techy I thought it was going to be easier to use the second thing is they said I'm not getting enough support I thought this was going to be handheld the whole time when in fact this is more of a DIY product the third is okay even if I am
(14:54) techy enough and I have enough support I'm not getting the result that I wanted soon enough it actually takes me much longer than I expected now when we look at these three things by the way these are going to be very common complaints with any service main reason if you think about the value equation I was stating earlier if someone says it takes it's too techy that means there's a lot of effort and sacrifice required right which is one of the four things so they said too much effort and sacrifice when they say not enough support it means they thought it was going to be easier
(15:23) meaning their perceived likelihood of achievement was higher and then when we got into reality they're like oh my perceived likelihood is much lower because this looks hard and so two of our four value drivers have already been eliminated it's like oh no and then finally we've got this thing's taking longer so we have our time delay and so when we look at these three things they actually are the inverse they're the nightmare version of the unv value equation it takes too long I now don't think I'm going to be able to be successful and this thing is going to
(15:52) take way too much effort and sacrifice so if these are the problems how do we solve them so we actually solve two of these problems with the same solution and one of them we solved with a completely different solution so one and three we did by rescripting the sales process overall and so fundamentally you could solve this problem in two ways one is we could add more to the thing on the back which costs money and that's okay or we can simply set better expectations up front and so when we listen to sales
(16:18) calls we're like oh I could understand why someone would think this if he says it this way or I could understand why they would think it would be happen this fast the way they set those expectations and so we rescripted the sales process and here's the thing guess what we sold the same amount and so a lot of times when you're a small business owner you feel like you have to promise the moon but the thing is is that sometimes when you promise the Moon it actually makes people doubt you more CU they're like I
(16:41) don't even believe you and so sometimes when you actually lower expectations you increase their perceived like of achievement because they actually believe you now they're like okay that seems realistic and so it actually didn't change our close rates at all and so sometimes you can reel your sales team back and still close the same amount by just being clear and honest and to be fair I don't think the guys were trying to be dishonest it was just we found out that the way they said some of these things gave an expectation that
(17:05) was different and by just doing that we solved two out of these three problems so the third one was people saying not enough support so of course we could add more support which I'll get to something we did in a second but what we did was we wanted to increase their perception of support and the way we did that was we made it more available so we already had support we had a support team but the thing is is that they were difficult to reach so we did was we created chat support but we made it easily accessible within the software and so rather than have to go outside in order to reach
(17:33) them they could hit a bubble and then immediately be online chatting someone now remember from the onboarding call they also know specifically who they can reach out to as well so this is two types of support they have an account rep design assigned to them and they have kind of General support to help them through daily little things that were coming up and in your business you probably have similar things you have one person who's really responsible for the account and then maybe a team of people who kind of feel the general
(17:56) questions from dayto day and by doing this this we eliminated this perceived problem people had even though we already had the solution we just had to make it easier for them and so if you want the 2011 Advanced business owner hat what we actually were a to find out is based on the chat bubble what page in the software they were clicking for support were're able to see which Pages or at what parts in the process of using the software people were getting stuck they were getting bottlenecked and so this gave us huge insights in terms of our product road map to figure out okay these are the places we need to be
(18:30) putting more of our attention so even if the engineering team's like man I want to build this amazing new thing it's like well dude 82% of our complaints are coming from this one point so we need to clear up this page and make it easier for them to understand so we don't have to keep doing this and so on the product side we're able to proactively solve it by making the page easier and reactively make it easier for them to get support even if it doesn't solve it so let me give you one more cool little tidbit that we did which I recommend across
(18:55) everything not just on product which is we lowered the average grade level of the language we used on the page and so once we lowered the grade level of the language more people understood it and were able to use it and I'm telling you right now if you're sending emails or you're writing ads or you're scripting a sales process or an onboarding process run the script through a reading level grader and it will tell you what grade the vocabulary you're using is based at and so if you're talking to people at a
(19:25) sixth grade level or an eighth grade level then guess what 30% of people are automatically not even going to understand what you're saying and as crazy as this is a huge slice of America doesn't even know how to read this isn't about being highbrow and hotty you're trying to help as many customers as you can their money is as good as anyone else's and so if you want to immediately get improved conversion improved experience better expectations lower refunds just lower the grade level of the language you speak at so to be clear these are the problems these were the
(19:55) solutions let's go on to problem number three so the third big problem was actually how we were compensating our team so the problem is we had misaligned incentives so we had tons of people were incentivized to sell on the front end but we had no one who was incentivized to keep people on the back end so the first problem here and this is a really big one that I see happen too often is the sales team was Fielding customer support issues and so let me be super clear if you want to destroy your sales team and annihilate any kind of Goodwill
(20:25) and Morale on that team have them talk to all the disat ified customers that they sold last week while they're trying to sell new customers on how great the product is today horrible decision but that's exactly basically what would happening because they didn't have a dedicated rep and so the person they had actually spoken the longest with was a sales rep and so they reached out to the person they knew that helped them do this so they could get help these people aren't equipped to do it also unfortunately neither are they
(20:50) incentivized to and so it destroys their front-end sales destroys their conviction and they also takes up time on their calendars and they're trying to be ethically good people but at the same time it's just outside of scope the reason this is so important for the sales team is that the underlying tone of how someone talks to a prospect is going to be their conviction right so that's a big term but it just means like how they say the words the pace that they say the words where they emphasize where they lean back and so if you want to destroy conviction you show them that
(21:19) the thing they're selling sucks because then they won't want to push they won't want to ask for their questions cuz on some level they're like you know what I don't even know if this person's going to get helped with this now every person here has that somebody you know in your life who had their life changed right so if you've ever had somebody who you know became a Christian and then was on fire for the Lord you can feel the conviction that they have now some of them don't have the skill of sales but you can feel
(21:41) that they believe what they're selling what they're talking about and so if conviction is one of the strongest predictors of sales close rate because of how you say the words on the script then destroying that is surely the way to destroy sales so the second issue here is that because we had misaligned incentives our CS team didn't try so if someone reached out they would maybe respond maybe respond slowly and they had no incentive to really get a hold of them and the easiest way I can explain this is imagine you have a kid or a parent or a family member or a friend who's in trouble and you need to reach
(22:16) them would you just shoot them a text and then be like I guess I'll just figure it out no you would text them multiple times you'd call them multiple times you'd reach out to them on social media you'd call their friends to see if you can get get in touch with them you would actually try to get a hold of them not just go through the motions and so RCS team at the time wasn't trying the third was that if they did somehow get in contact with the customer because that customer was right there at that moment when the Cs person responded and
(22:46) they'd hop on a call with them the call was unstructured they had no script they were following they had no process they basically just said what can I help you with and then they would go from there which is a terrible way to handle Cs and I want to give you a a larger take away from this so I'm I'm leaking into number three here every conversation with a customer has a perfect way that that conversation could and should go and so if you know that there are consistent conversations that are going to happen
(23:10) with your business you know that there's a sales conversation you know there's a lead nurture conversation you know there's an onboarding conversation guess what else there is there's multiple CS or customer success conversations that are going to occur well if we script all this stuff and then we don't script all this stuff why do we think that this stuff would somehow be better than this stuff in your mind you're like wait but the problems they have are different on the back end no they're not the same people who say they're going to have
(23:34) different problems on the back end are the same people who are like every sale is the same well you can't have it both ways sure well they're only going to ask questions about timing they're going to ask questions about decision maker they're going to try and stall they're going to try and say they don't have the money for it oh wait these are all different things that someone's going to present with here well over here they're going to say oh I don't know how to log in oh I don't know how to do step one oh
(23:57) I don't know how to do step two oh this third thing broke how do I fix it they're going to have the same few things that 90% of people are going to present with and guess what we do we script so this is what we did to solve these three problems so number one is instead of having no team and having the sales team field it we created a dedicated escalations Team all right so think about this as triage so if you get hurt the first thing you do when you go to the emergency is they have triage they basically figure out how badly hurt you are and where you need to go that's
(24:28) what the escalations team did that was the first thing so just off doing that close rate goes up sales team morale stays High because now they also have someone they can just shuttle people over to if it comes to them these people become the catchall the second thing is okay well now that we have the escalations team now we can align their incentives we can create a commission structure so that we have real cost in the business for someone leaving one is we have to give a refund or we have to give a charge Mark which sucks right or the bigger one that no one talks about is you just have a lower reputation
(24:59) people buy and then tell other people not to buy so you lose maybe no money on this sale but you lose three customers you would have lost over here so it's worse than a refund you lost three times or five times the amount and guess what happens from these people these people tell other people not to buy the thing so sometimes not serving One customer can cost you tons and tons of money so let me give you a little litmus test for this if your ads or your method of getting customers was getting you customers at call it 10 to1 in the beginning beginning and all of a sudden now you're getting customers at 5 to1 or
(25:32) 3:1 and it's only been a year later your cost to a Car customer should only go up with the increased cost of CPM meaning the cost per impression and so if cpms go up by 15% a year or whatever they go up by then that's the amount that your ca should go up your cost to acquire a customer now the good news is that as a business owner you can increase your LTV over time as well and so you can combat that increase in CA with a corresponding increase in lifetime value but if your CAC has gone up double or triple in a short period of time everyone wants to believe that they're so good to get
(26:05) referrals but no one believes that they're bad enough to get anti-realists of customers that would have bought now won't because they know someone who told them you suck and the big obvious one is that if someone's not satisfied they're also not going to buy your next thing so what we did was we added a 10 to 15% commission yes real money on the back end for saving customers because if I have to pay $200 to save a $2,000 sale then I would certainly rather have $1,800 than zero and so some of you guys get greedy
(26:47) on this but it's like just do the math and so we did the commission structures we added the escalations team and so what about the unstructured calls you guessed it we scripted it and then you know what we did after we scripted it we practiced the script and so we said hey what happens if someone presents with problem number one same as what if someone says they have to talk to their spouse what if someone says they don't have their card on them what if someone says not now's not a good time what if someone says you get the idea you script it and you practice it but now we have a
(27:18) dedicated team that has an incentive that's aligned and a scripted process that we know yields a consistent result and gets people unfucked in the situation now remember I said that CS didn't try well guess what the result of this commission incentive was all of a sudden because they had an incentive they were texting they were emailing they were calling three to five times so now all of a sudden it's almost like they give a [ __ ] because they get paid to Wild I know I'll be here all day so let me let me give you the the real
(27:50) breakdown of this to get in contact with a customer when they are escalated or they have some sort of issue that's presenting is the inverse of lead nurture now if you're thinking through this with your 201 Advanced business owner cap a business actually looks a lot like a bow tie all right so you've got lots of marketing that funnels into a sales process and you have a lead nurture process that leads into that and then you have onboarding and then you go back out again so let me explain what that looks like if you work a lead a lot
(28:15) in the beginning and then less and less over time because they're less interested so in the beginning you call them three times a day and then three times a day tomorrow and then a week later you maybe call once a day and then after that you call them once every two weeks just to follow up it's actually the reverse with a customer so you call them and reach out to them via email SMS and call one time today if they don't respond tomorrow I'm reaching out twice the next day I'm reaching out three times we actually increase the amount of Reach Out attempts we have for the
(28:45) customer because the issue is clearly more and more escalated whereas with a lead you decrease the amount that you reach out to them as time goes on to fix the sales feeding issue we created the team to align their incentives we created the Mission and then that created multi-lane ReachOut that was repetitive and escalating over time and when they did finally get in contact with them we had a scripted process that we had trained on so that they could execute the right conversation every time so the result of bad onboarding getting fixed bad expectations getting
(29:17) set and misaligned incentives was the big result and then I'll give you the takeways that you can immediately use in your business so the result of all that work was three main things this is the net change one we had a 61% reduction in cancellation so people wanting to leave or refund or have some negative experience the second is that 25% so one in four of the people who got on a support call an escalation call chose to ascend and actually buy a higher level of service meaning you know what I thought I was going to need just a little bit of handholding I actually want to have more and I'm willing to pay
(29:50) for more help with that thing I just bought and then three is that companywide because these implementations happened across all facets of the company 2.4x the overall ascensions and so obviously here with the escalations we got a piece here we got a piece on the front we got a piece on the side but the overall when you aggregate all these changes together was a 2.
(30:15) 4x increase that was that 20 to 48% increase in ascensions almost half of customers who bought the first thing decided they actually wanted to buy an even better more expensive version of thing with more Professional Services tacked on top now here's where this is extremely sexy I only talk to you about the $2 million in the reductions what I didn't include was all the extra money because most people don't even believe the numbers anyways but the extra money that we were able to make and so the cool thing is is that all of this drops straight to the bottom line because
(30:45) we've already paid the cost to acquire the customer and software has notoriously high gross margins meaning someone buying another version or higher priced version of the software cost pennies versus how much we're charging for it all right so here are the first five takeaways for you one there's always going to be a cost of change or something new and so whenever you're going to introduce something don't get discouraged from the initial stats that's just opportunity to improve all right so whenever I see something like that like when we had these big numbers
(31:16) in the beginning I was like oh man we're going to be able to crush this and make even more as soon as we Crump these things down because the thing is is the problems are known and the solutions are also known we just have to do them all right so number one the cost of change is fixed number two if you don't track you don't care and so when I talk to businesses and I sometimes ask them like hey what are your customer success scores or what are your what are your CAD scores or what which is customer satisfaction or what are your NPS scores which is net promoter score they're like uh it's really good I think our refund
(31:45) rate's low okay there's a big difference between people hating you so much that they ask for their money back and the massive amount of people who just don't like you but don't hate you enough to ask for back because it's inconvenient the amount of money doesn't cost enough to them or they just said screw it I'm just going to move on with my life and tell everyone I know that you suck and in the very beginning when I started asking prodding more around these questions we didn't have metrics around almost any of this stuff and so
(32:08) sometimes one of the easiest things to do is ignore a problem by not tracking any of it but one of the most interesting things that I found across business and humans in general is that metrics can be an intervention into and of itself if I want someone to lose weight I don't even have to tell them anything to do besides weighing themsel every morning and when you do that you start to lose weight and so metrics and tracking itself can be a powerful intervention overall in any business for something that you want to improve and
(32:38) so if you're not even sure what to do to fix a problem the first step you can do is just track it number three is that you're never too big for good Cs and so think about companies like Chick-fil-A they've got gazillions of employees and they still have an amazing customer experience think about companies like Amazon that sell gazillions of dollars a year of products now you think wait a second I've never been on the phone with customer sport on Amazon well I can tell you I have and it's good and it's fast
(33:04) and for a company that size for them to be able to field the number of increas I'm sure that they get per day is insane but they still don't think they're too good or too big to have an amazing customer experience number four a lot of entrepreneurs are very afraid of talking to unhappy customers but I promise you that is where the gold is and I continue to say this but Paul Graham from YC has said this before he says you can solve almost every business Problem by talking to your customer more and so if you want to know what's going on with sales talk
(33:33) to the people who just got sold if you want to know what's going on with the product figure out where people are asking all the questions on your page just get on the phone sometimes ask people why didn't you buy on the phone and they will give you the gold you need to fix your sales process to fix your product to fix your onboarding so that they actually will in the future so get on the phone with people who hate you and by the way a lot of times if you just let them vent you just let them talk to you A lot of them will actually give you more money too and if one out of four customers buy something that's
(34:02) four or five times as expensive you actually recovered 100% of the refunds or cancellations that you get think about this for a second if you have a $1,000 thing and you sell a $4,000 thing is your upsell if you get on the phone with four people and one of these people buys the $4,000 thing that escalation to Ascension covered the loss from the other three so you can eliminate the revenue loss you have by simply seeing the conversation for what it is which is it's also a sale and as a side note unhappy customers will usually get on
(34:34) the phone with you so especially if they feel underserved the pickup rate on the cost for these is actually through the roof when we started reaching out the team was like oh wow like they pick up pretty fast because they gave you money and they want their value number five followup is a double-edged sword so let me explain here if you sell low ticket lots of units of stuff those customers in general cannot be communicated with too much people love when they're in the low end to be talked to all the time the
(35:03) more affluent your customer the wealthier the more expensive the thing often time counterintuitively they don't want you to reach out to them they just want it to work and so understanding what level of Avatar you're selling to can help you understand how often you should reach out to those customers for example for me with a vendor I never want to talk to them I just want it to work now some people if they're spending that amount of money with you and it's a lot of money to them then they're going to want to talk to you all the time and if that's the nature of the customer you sell to then you have to deal with that so let's talk magically about these
(35:39) other three six seven and eight so the first is revenue retention now when I was starting out in business all I care about was sales and marketing was just getting more people in the front door what I thought it took to grow a business was to just sell more of those people and that's only half true now let me tell you a story of two different businesses let's say there's a business that sells 100 customers this year 200 customers next year 300 customers the third year and that business loses 100% of customers every year so that business
(36:08) has still tripled three years later business 2 sells 100 customers this year 100 customers next year but they kept the first 100 so they have 200 customers and then 100 customers the third year but they kept the 100 and the 100 so now they have 300 customers both of these companies are the same size at the end of year three but which company would you have this one because the thing is is that here you're keeping all your customers and unless you have a compounding vehicle within your business the only way to grow is to continue to Market and sell more but I promise you there's a cap to that there's a reason
(36:42) that people in the information direct response whatever space can't grow past a certain amount because they have basically the marketing team of a $300 million business but they're only doing 30 because they can only do 30 that year and lose everybody every single year and so I want to be clear it's valuable to understand how to acquire customers you have to learn how to do it especially when you're starting out but it's one of those double-edged swords where what it took you to get here and get started isn't what it takes to create a really big business and so in this business we
(37:13) get obsessed and me personally as an investor the number one thing I look at is how many customers last year are still paying you because I can build on that base if we're not keeping anyone then what's the point in adding gas to this fire we're just letting more people know we suck the next takeaway is around pilots and so you'll notice that we only did this with 15% of customers and so this was going to be a more expensive intervention right we went from one on 25 to one on one so there's a huge amount of headcount that we're going to add for this but when we test we test with a very small slice to make sure
(37:44) that it's worth the investment and let's say that these numbers had only marginally improved then I'd be like all right now I wouldn't have said okay we shouldn't fix them I would say this isn't the way we fix them we thought we had a hypothesis that it would work but we actually did properly but it didn't turn out the way we thought and so when you test you just test basically a guess that I think this will solve it and so if you think about this like the scientific method which you remember from sixth grade you have a hypothesis then you figure out did we do the thing
(38:11) yes or no and did the thing we want to have happened happen and so if you never execute it you'll never know if your hypothesis is true or not and so you have to have a good guess you have to actually do it and then you can still perfectly execute something and have it still not work but understanding the bet you're going to make and what is required which you can Define ahead of time what do these stats need to look like for this to be a worth it deal and if it is then you roll it out and around Revenue retention that cost that we just
(38:39) talked about by incurring these extra CS reps if I can employ somebody for 70,000 a year or 100,000 a year and then they can save me $2 million a year or $500,000 a year I'm still getting 5 to one back on the internal resource allocation and so the bigger business gets the more you actually become more like an investor you have to think I have all these people I have all these resources I have all this money and I want to allocate these resources in a way that gets me the highest return within the business and so if you have something can get you a 5x or a 10x within the company you make that bet
(39:12) every time proactive CS so we want to be as fast or faster reaching out to customers as we are with leads and I want to tell you a little story that's not about this company but about a different company we have that might drive this home so we look at our LTV across a huge slice of customers and it turned out the second highest LTV Avatar we had was customers that we saw were not using the full extent of The Suite of services we had and we proactively downgraded them we said hey it looks like you're only using three of the 10 things we do if you're only going to use these three we actually have a service
(39:48) level that's half of what you're currently paying and you get the same stuff and here's the crazy thing when you do a proactive downgrade where it's actually still completely meeting their expectations those people never cancel they're like this this place is awesome they were ethical about it they reached out to me they helped me save money like I love these guys and as business owners we're afraid to do that but if that person cancels in two months versus staying for 10 it's worth way more not to mention the compounding Word of Mouth
(40:16) the referrals and all the other benefits testimonials that we can get down the road from that customer from being run like a good business and so if you treat the customers as important as you do your leads you'll probably be in really good shape and hey this is all customer success stuff this is all getting people to like you more and spend more money with you but if you need to do more marketing let me show you a case study did for one of our portfolio companies where we doubled it in 60 days

Get RICH With These 24 Investing Rules - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) 24 rules of investing these are all structured as if then statements if we learn a principle then we can continue to use that winning principle over and over again the reason some of the greatest investors publish books about their principles is because they know if people make the right decisions they get the right outcomes over a long enough time Horizon my abduction and I make these videos because I hope that if you have a 3 million to 100 million dollar company you'll ask us to invest in it and we can help you grow up
(00:23) if you can't buy it twice don't buy it once and realistically probably three four five six times when I got into investing I used to think oh I'm going to put like a third into this they're like dude no your biggest allocation might be 10 oh if you can't buy twice don't buy once if you're worried about it you can buy insurance for it you can get insurance on anything for example people like I'm afraid of running out of money you can literally buy money for the rest of your life you can literally give money and they will
(00:52) have a guaranteed income until you die which are called annuities so if you have a specific concern just buy insurance for it and know that it's covered if a deal feels like a grand slam get a second opinion whenever I'm looking at something and something looks amazing I automatically send it to other people I must not be seeing something like I need someone else's eyes on this it's a good easy decision making rule for yourself for investing if you don't know how you can lose money don't do it until you do there's always
(01:16) a way to lose money in the deal and you not only want to find a way to lose money but you want to find all the ways you can lose money in the deal right we're always controlling for the unknown or the unknowable we want to minimize that the highest degree possible so if you don't know how you can lose money don't do the deal until you do if it feels rushed don't do it a lot of people will try and apply pressure to you they're trying to say like hey do this deal with me hey give me this money hey can you lend me this thing if
(01:38) someone tries to pressure you pause if you feel rushed don't do it if you only have one deal on the table don't do the deal always have backup deals imagine you're dating and there's only one girl on the planet you're gonna find a way to think that that girl and if you know your gender's reverse flip right whatever you know what I'm saying there's only one person on the planet then you're gonna find a way to make that work and so it's kind of the same thing with deals if you only have one deal on the table you're going to keep
(02:03) telling yourself man maybe this is a good deal because you have nothing else to compare it to you always want to have a plethora of options to choose from and until you get those many options to choose from don't move forward because what happens is you artificially make that girl look a lot better or that person or that deal looks a lot better when there's nothing else compared to if you buy with the intention of selling you're not investing you're trading investing is about very very long time Horizons it's a whole different set of
(02:26) rules where you get in trouble is where you're trying to apply business stuff to investing or investing stuff to business like they are different skills to master if we don't agree we don't do it this comes into play when you have a partnership this has saved me so many mistakes because I'm usually the Yes man I tend to see more upside and less downsides most entrepreneurial people are that way because we have to be because if we actually focused on the likelihood of success which is usually low for most entrepreneurial things you
(02:52) would never get started it's good a to have a partner who balances that b they actually have to balance it if they're just a Yes Man and they always bend to your will then they're not actually providing value there's a reason yin and yang are equally weighted in the symbol if you don't agree don't move forward even if I have decision-making Authority I still won't move forward until we agree as a tangent into marriage stuff we get asked this all the time they're like well you know push comes to show somebody has the upper hand honestly no
(03:18) we keep talking about until we agree we don't make the decision until we both agree and it's been one of the earliest pieces of advice we got and it's been one of the ones that paid us the most dividends if it's complicated pass if it feels above your head it probably is people want to feel fancy they want to get into the room they want to do these deals but if you don't get it you're gonna get [ __ ] if you have complete understanding of something the risk goes down because you understand the variables you're barely catching on you
(03:42) might as well be gambling which is not the way to invest fomo means slow down so if you feel that emotion you're like I'm gonna miss out on something slow down this is a decision making variable when you feel that emotion slow down these are principles you start flexing these like muscles if this then that if this then that it preserves your ability to make better decisions over time and if you apply all of these things to all the decisions you make you will have outside returns over a longer time Horizon no diligence no deal if you don't get
(04:10) the information you need to make the decision you don't make the decision and I know this sounds ridiculous but many of you do this you just go off the hype you go off an email or a phone call get the information you need no model no deal if someone doesn't send me their proposal for how something's going to grow or how something's going to improve or how they're going to add value and there's no deal I don't want to hear a story of it I want to see the math behind it I want to see the projections and then when I look at
(04:35) those things I can make the decision like is this reasonable what assumptions is this based on do I think those assumptions are reasonable or probable and what information can I bring to this decision what are the things I need to believe that have to be true for this to occur if someone's non-responsive No Deal communication is one of the most important things when you're doing any kind of business in general and I judge someone very quickly on how meticulous they are in their responses and how quick they are to respond in general now
(04:59) if someone says hey I received your email I'll get back to you in two days and then they get back to me in two days that's fine it's about expectation setting and expectation meeting I expect especially in this process where I'm just getting to know you what you say is going to happen is going to happen it's one of the easiest ways to build a reputation is do what you're going to say say what you're going to do and if someone's not doing that with you don't do the deal if it costs peace of mind don't buy it so if anything costs me my sleep or
(05:24) something that I'm worried about as a result of me making an investment or a purchasing decision I don't buy it because the cost is too high if it doesn't build your reputation don't do it no neutral moves your brand personally your reputation is the one thing that you take with you forever and you absolutely can lose it and it can be irreparably damaged I'd only do it if it fills my reputation when we do that we continue to reinvest in our reputation in our personal brand which gives us compounding returns over our entire
(05:55) lifespan in terms of relationships in terms of literally Financial return in all other aspects of Life only invest if it builds your reputation if it doesn't build don't do it no track record No Deal performance over Charisma the best predictor of future performance is past performance sure they have a model fantastic oh they're allowing us to do diligence great oh they're being very responsive phenomenal but if they have no track record might they be successful yes but if I invest in every deal that doesn't have
(06:23) track records is that a good way to invest probably not like Napoleon like to say I'd rather have lucky generals someone's gonna probably do their deal it doesn't have to be you if it's the same thing you've always done well with do more of it we as humans or entrepreneurs we like having variety the thing is is that a lot of investing a lot of compounding comes from doing more of the same thing so it's like hey man I've done three hard money loans and they've all been awesome it's like well then you should probably
(06:44) consider doing a fourth rather than starting to get into crypto day trading what happens is you start to build your own track record and so you can start looking back over your shoulder be like okay let's look at all the things that I've done these have been the things that have worked well maybe I'm better at this stuff and so that's the idea once you find something you're starting to get good at do more of it because the thing is is that your luck will improve the more you do always under borrow any number no matter
(07:04) how big it is multiplied by zero is still zero I tend to be very risk-averse when it comes to debt debt introduces risk into any equation if you are going to borrow then under borrow so even though you could juice your return by getting more remember that there is a likelihood over a long enough time rise in that if you over juice on a consistent basis you will get zero always under borrow then you won't make as much money but you won't lose it ask stupid questions Define terms draw pictures see examples and if you can't
(07:30) draw it back you don't get it I start every single call when somebody's gonna bring me something I'll be like pretend I'm a golden retriever that doesn't speak English walk me through this there's no advantage to somebody thinking you know more than you do not but there is advantages to you knowing more than they think you do always play the fool if we're not in the GP we're not in the deal once you have 10 20 you know 30 million in investable assets just say I want a part of the GP I don't know what the GP is it's General partner limited
(07:56) partner the people with General partners are basically the people who run the thing so they get an exercise to the pie versus the limited partners who actually invest the money we only do deals that we're part of the GP because I want to make sure that we have a part of the people who are really running this thing if it's a bad person it's a bad deal Layla has an impeccable people picker it's unbelievable my entire relationship's never been wrong and it's why I've been wrong all the time I'm like this guy's great Layla's never been
(08:17) wrong bad Partners doesn't matter what the paper says don't do it there are so many reasons you should not do a deal you should be saying no way more than you should be saying yes no contract no deal this is a really important one for me gotta have contracts for everything contracts serve the purpose of setting clear expectation what happens if you lose all my [ __ ] what happens if you don't do what you said you're gonna what happens if I don't do what I said I was going to do what happens like you got to walk
(08:40) through that if you can't walk through in the beginning you're definitely not going to walk through it when it actually happens and anyone who says I only do handshake deals I don't do contracts run the other way not once has someone approached me that way and they not being unbelievably Shady if there's anything you get for this video if someone says I don't believe in contracts be like I don't believe in dealing deals without contracts sorry clear expectations good if you're the one people are doing business with I like to pretend like the
(09:07) contract doesn't exist you absolutely want to be clear when you're writing the contracts and the terms but then as soon as that process is over live as though the contract doesn't exist negotiate it as though it's the only thing that matters let's say I have a Services relationship that's a year-long I want to mentally think even though they've committed to a year I'm only week to week they don't have to pay me next month if you go on the defensive when you're Contracting but you go on the offensive when you're in delivery you
(09:27) kind of get the best of both worlds

10 KEYS to a TERRIBLE Business Partnership [GUARANTEED!] - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JShQ8BX08rs

Transcript:
(00:00) when you're in a business relationship you're in a marriage and their extracurricular life is going to get dragged into the business i promise you in this video i want to give you the keys to having a terrible terrible partnership and the reason we're talking about in this perspective is because my my my big hero charlie munger talked about inverted thinking as one of the best ways to solve problems so rather than think how do i have an amazing partnership let's think about how would i guarantee a miserable terrible
(00:23) partnership that would uh definitely ensue in a terrible breakup with lots of lawyers and all the paperwork and just honestly ideally take forever and result in no benefit all right and if you don't know hi my name is alex mosey i own acquisition.com it's a portfolio of companies over 100 million i make these videos because i hope that you make lots and lots of money from them and then hopefully you apply to become a portfolio company with us as long as you're doing you know three to let's say 20 million dollars a year and ideally an
(00:46) internet business now that being said let's rock and roll on how to have a terrible partnership now as somebody who has a lot of partnerships um it has taken me a very long time to get here and i have learned a lot along the way and the beauty of having stories is that you can get the lessons without the scars and so i will give you let's see one two three four five six seven eight nine ten ten different things that you can do to guarantee absolutely atrocious terrible partnership that you wish you could just not live anymore right that
(01:09) is that's what's gonna happen if we can make this partnership as terrible as we're going to shoot for here all right so number one is that we're going to make sure that they have the exact same knowledge base as you all right so this person that you're going to do business with knows the exact same stuff at you there's no stuff that they know that you don't know all right because that way one of you is not unnecessary all right and so this is a great way to have a terrible start to a partnership one of you being unnecessary to begin with
(01:29) which means both of you are giving away half your equity for no incremental benefit it's also not very good for the business because why would you do that so that being said number one have the same knowledge base and maybe even if we're being crazy which we are right throw into the same experiences right if you both worked at the same place doing the same thing why not start a business together doing the exact same thing brilliant i know all right so number two is time right make sure that uh they have the same amount of time as you all
(01:52) right or disproportionate and what i mean there is the big three on partnerships is knowledge money time right which means they either have to have knowledge you don't have they got to have money you don't have they got to have time you don't have right and so if you have no time make sure they don't have time too right now if you do have time and they have time then you're fine but the thing is then you'd have to look at one of the other three parts of this equation in order to make sure that it's still a terrible partnership all right
(02:11) so make sure that you're misaligned on time all right the next one is money if you're getting into a partnership if uh one of you has money and the other doesn't then that's value that's being out of the relationship but if uh you're going to partner with somebody and they don't have money that you don't have they don't have knowledge that you don't have and they don't have time they don't have then why would you do the partnership i don't know but it is a great way to have a terrible partnership which is what the purpose of this video
(02:29) is now that being said let's say that somehow we still figured out a way that we got in a relationship where one of us didn't have the knowledge of the timer didn't have the money that the other person had we got together okay cool there's still more ways that we can we can torpedo this thing just wait buckle up so the next one is that we can make sure that we have different expectations of one another and the business all right so it's like hey what do i expect you to do what do you expect me to do right and those expectations we want to
(02:50) make sure and this is number five is that there's no agreements we don't record it anywhere we don't write it down we do it on a handshake because we're old school yeah great way to have a terrible business relationship and the reason that people don't want to do that is because usually they don't want to have the hard conversations all right they don't want to say what happens if this goes wrong right and like what do you expect you really expect me to take the trash out every day like they want to have this unspoken expectation you
(03:09) have unspoken expectations of you know what's going to be magical where you you don't actually have to have hard conversations with people and if you can't have a hard conversation with a partner before even doing business before you are even married before you there is even money or stakes on the table or equity value that's been grown then dear god you're not gonna have a good conversation at the end all right so if someone's like i don't do agreements just walk away i just i've been doing this like just walk away it's
(03:29) only like very very very weird people do that like banks banks don't just give you money without expectatio like come on like this is real world and i used to i remember earlier on i i heard someone tell me that and i was like oh i don't want to be the guy he's like i'm the type of person that if you can't uh shake your hand then blah blah and i just i just don't i just don't trust people that much so the idea for me is make sure the paper says we needed to say but then trust the person right which is like i hope that we never have
(03:53) like we write these contracts with the intention of never having to look at them right but we still use the contract as a vehicle to facilitate dialogue around difficult topics and to have shared expectations in a way that we both understand them and agree right that is the purpose of the contract it's not to get lawyers involved purpose of the contract is that we have clear expectation that is why contracts exist clear expectations on agreements all right so if we're making sure that we have a terrible partnership we got to
(04:14) have all the same knowledge we got to have disproportionate time or money right so all those things time money knowledge we're we're all matched on those which means that one of us isn't necessary on top of that we have different expectations we didn't write it down so there's no agreements and there's no expectations have been communicated about what you're gonna do what i'm gonna do all right now the next one this big one give away everything all right so make sure that you give away everything in the partnership and
(04:32) do a disproportionate amount of work at the onset because that way you'll just definitely make sure that you can garner a resentment towards the other person and the flip side can be true too if you know the other person doing a lot of work uh then you think to yourself oh well i'm going to squeeze as much out of them as i possibly can well what's going to happen they're going to resent you and they're going to try and renegotiate later once reality sets in so if you can think a few steps ahead of the person
(04:50) rather than saying like oh i'm going to get them just say like hey i don't know if this is going to be equitable in the future like give them more and you'll actually start to create a relationship rather than a negotiated contractual agreement which at the end of the day that's all contracts are supposed to do is just outline the expectations between two parties that's it all right now the next one is that we want to make sure that we have not we won't have a misaligned three things mission values and vision all right which means that we
(05:11) don't actually want to take this business to the same place and this may sound hilarious to you but you would be amazed at the amount of partners that we get on the phone with that i'm like what do you guys want to do this business and what person's like i think we should go this way the others like i think we should go that way i'm like i think that you should figure that out right or one of you shouldn't be here right figure it out all right which is where do we want to go and the next one is the values which is how we're going to get there
(05:29) right what are the things that are important to us about how we deal with other humans right what are those values and if some people have different values becomes very difficult to do business even if you want to accomplish the same thing because you want to do it different ways right and that'll create endless strife and conflict throughout now the last one is what you consider lifestyle right which is what are you uh similar interests lifestyle uh it's very difficult to do business with somebody if you're like you're a dave ramsey
(05:50) saver and you you know you're you live far below your means and you're doing business with somebody who lives far above their means and goes into debt all the time because the thing is is when you're in a business relationship you're in a marriage and their extracurricular life is going to get dragged into the business i promise you i promise you it is going to get dragged in right and so you've got to look just like you uh you marry the girl you marry the family that whole thing um it's the same thing with
(06:13) business if like they've got all this crazy stuff going on in their personal life it's a great way to guarantee that that stuff is going to trickle into your business and the thing is is if you have an unreliable partner creates an unreliable relationship which creates an unreliable business and so it's a great way to have a terrible partnership all right and so when we're thinking about partners big picture i give you two frameworks and then some in-betweens so framework one is that they got to have knowledge money or time that you don't
(06:33) have if both of you have the exact same experience knowledge time and money one of you isn't required i know crazy the thing is is just because you need something for example if i need an accountant for business doesn't mean i have to partner with my accountant it means i have to pay them for services so just because you have a need doesn't mean they have to have equity all right it's a big aha moment here if you're like well i don't know how to do that he does it's like well can you pay someone to do it like equity is the most
(06:53) expensive thing that you give up in a relationship so you want to make sure if you especially want to build something big then you're giving away equity to people who are going to really drive the growth and you have to see this thing 10 years in the future which no one thinks 10 years in the future anyways which is why everyone's small okay so boom so knowledge money time you got to check those boxes make sure that you're aligned there next one is expectations agreements all right make sure that they're equitable make sure that they're
(07:10) well understood and making sure that they're documented right if you do those things then it's very very it's much less likely that you're gonna have a terrible partnership you can still have one but it's much less likely all right and the point of this video is to guarantee a terrible partnership all right now the next big framework is that mission values and similar interests it actually works the same way in marriages as dozen partnerships and to be real it's very similar so you got to make sure that you want to do the same thing
(07:29) with the business big picture you got to make sure you want to do it the same way right and then you got to have similar interests and lifestyles right which is making sure that they don't have a messy life which you want to be proud to associate with the other person that you're doing business with and i'm saying proud not okay with but proud to associate with them you want other people to meet them just like you want to meet you know the girl meets the parents you want to be proud to present this person not like crap right big
(07:47) picture great ways to guarantee a terrible partnership is if you do all those things all right so on the flip side make sure that they have time money and knowledge that you don't have right either they got money you don't have they got time you don't have they don't they have knowledge you don't have or experience right so they can bring something table you don't already have so one of you or both of you are required and that the company grows based on the shared skill sets that both of you have all right you want to make
(08:06) sure that you set expectations that you document them and then you make sure that they're equitable all right because if you do that then it's very unlikely that you're going to fail right and the next one is that you want to make sure that there's aligned mission values and similar interests you want to deal with the types of people who see the world the same way as you have the biggest long-term goals and they want to do the process of getting from where you are to where you want to go the same way you do
(08:25) and the easiest litmus test is if you present both of you with the same data would you make the same decision if these answers yes then you'll have far less conflict in your partnership over the long haul and so the idea is can i find people who have complementary skill sets but align mission values and interests if you can do that you can make room for a magical rather than terrible partnership all right keeping awesome donation lots of love and i'll catch you guys next video bye mozzie nation if you enjoyed that video smash

The Alex Hormozi Guide to Haters [REVEALED] - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxQJ64BNuco

Transcript:
(00:00) I get a lot of hate let's go through some of the fun ones that my team pulled we'll see him working at Starbucks soon loser how much did the fake private jet cost you loser if you do anything worth doing there will be people who oppose you and they will throw rocks at you and attack and I want to break down how I've dealt with it going from 1 75 million for the last 2 years so you can too so I want to walk through kind of two Frameworks that I think through when dealing with hate NE ity people calling you a liar first things first this is
(00:33) the quick and dirty and then I'll get a little bit more nuanced so when someone attacks you you have three options as I see it if the claim they are making has an element of Truth at level one you have ignore this is what I would consider my all-time heavyweight champion of the world personal preference ignoring it cost me the least amount of time the least amount of effort and and this is a very very important one they're choosing to advertise me they're choosing to take all their hard-earned attention their
(01:03) eyes the Goodwill they have in their audience and say hey everyone look at Alex what a gift and the crazy thing is is that when people direct their customers towards you some of them buy that's what's mind-blowing to me I'm like thank God like loser 29 like I hope you keep doing this cuz it just continues to fill my bank account that being said ignore cost you the least there's no effort on your behalf it's amazing this is why it's probably one of my all-time favorite ways to deal with most things in life I'll give you the
(01:28) quote that my dad told me many many times in my life he said God gave you the power to ignore use it the second this one takes effort agree I think Gary popularized the concept of Eminem winning the rap battle I am white I am a [ __ ] I do live in a trailer with my mom the other guy couldn't talk [ __ ] about him is he claimed every single negative thing that was about him here tell these people something they don't know about me if someone says hey Alex you're such an egotistical douchebag and you don't care about other people I could agree
(02:02) yeah man I suck what do they say now there's nothing to say and it just silences it because the thing is is that conflict only goes on as long as there's an equal or opposing Force as soon as you step to their side of the table there's nothing to push against there's only one person allowed in the angry boat and so what you can do is you get in the angry boat with them and you say I know I suck and then they have to get out because if they agree with you then what it just eliminates the conflict there's nothing left to talk about and
(02:32) then you move on with your life now the third level of this is what I would consider Ninja level agree plus one or one up them so if someone says Alex you're an egotist I could say dude you don't know the half of it I do this and this and this insult yourself better than they can and you should know how to do it better than they can cuz you know you better than they do too so this is the quick and dirty 95% of the conflict are the attacks that you'll get you usually you can deal with with this three-step process if you haven't seen
(03:03) this there's an unbelievable scene in Ted lasso where Nate his former Protege gets on the camera live and talks a bunch of [ __ ] about him and says that he's an idiot he doesn't know what he's doing whatever fast forward to the press conference where they're asking Ted lasso and he handles it perfectly from a PR perspective and he actually uses number three he says oh man Nate said that about me man he could have said this he could have said this he could have said he could have made fun of my hey but that's Nate the great for you
(03:31) you know he's the same way on the pitch you know he'll find the tiniest little weakness in a team and just want to attack that and then the whole crew of newscasters just start laughing because there's nothing else to say now if he had then attacked back then it would have become this whole drama but after that it's done he puts it to rest and then Nate looks vicious for attacking somebody who has a sense of humor now the second category if someone lies they accuse you of lying about something this is something called an Extinction curve
(03:59) a CL example would be like I could yell at a rock and if I keep yelling at a rock at some point I will stop yelling at the Rock why cuz the rock doesn't give me any feedback and so what we want to be in the situation is The Rock when you are ignoring you are just you a stone they can do whatever they want it doesn't affect you and I love this position because you are greater than hate only comes from Below in my entire life it has never come from above and so if someone hates on you just take that as mental note of the fact that they're
(04:29) below you and they concede the fact that they follow you and so based on the person who's hating on you they will maybe hate on you one time and then disappear or hate on you two times and then disappear but if you don't respond they will eventually disappear it is just a fact of life unless they get reinforcement they will disappear and that's why I just choose not to engage I also don't like wasting my time now let's go into the ugly scenarios of what if what they're saying is basically calling you a liar around something core
(04:55) uh to your brand or what you've been known for here's my little box so you've got bigger than you smaller than you and then they said you lied about something or they said something else so let's start with the easiest one someone smaller than you and they just said Alex has big ears I can ignore them I could agree and be like hell yeah I got big ears you should see what else number three I could be like not only do I have big ears I could one up them like they're actually even worse when it rains cuz then I catches all the water
(05:31) and then my back gets wet it's a whole problem believe me my wife will tell you now all of a sudden there's nothing they can say so you do the one two three process here you pick whichever one you want and all three of them will serve you let's go into slightly harder territory they're smaller than you but they're basically calling you out on a lie that could threaten your reputation they say you falsified claim something along those lines which typically comes to just honesty which is one of the things that the whole world hates the
(05:56) world forgive just about anything except for a liar kind of interesting now in my opinion I'm just giving you the Alex Playbook I ignore that's it I ignore it as painful as it is and to see them you know frothing at the mouth and the common threads they have go back and forth never once have I made less money from anyone doing this because think about this the only way that you combat their message is by being louder with yours not directing your traffic to them and so you ignore them Plus us you amplify because every moment that
(06:34) I spend addressing them I stop giving value to my audience so in a very real way attacks have taken people down but because of how they responded not because of the strength of the attacker they take someone off their game then they get in this Petty pissing match with someone who's lower than them and it makes them look bad even if you win you lose it's a pic Victory you lose credibility people see a different side of you all of that's bad and so I prefer to pretend you don't exist and then 10x my message and tell everyone who's on my
(07:05) team these [ __ ] are lying and trying to destroy us the only way that you beat hate is you don't beat hate you drown it out and as a second point to this someone can hate on you who's below you and get you to respond it means that they control you they are in control of your actions how weak does that appear I want to be a rock I want somebody to be whatever the [ __ ] they want to do and I will continue to be a rock that's at least how I perceive these types of situations use it if useful but ignore and amplify now we've covered box one
(07:38) and two so these are the easy ones if someone's bigger than you and they say something else you one two three of them same as before and what I recommend is really lean into number three just eviscerate yourself so there was a major news Outlet like re top five you know who this news person is attacked somebody who's in the porn industry and they were discrediting and saying man look at what this generation has come to and it was just a video of a bunch of girls jumping in the pool whatever and so they responded because everyone tagged and
(08:06) knew who they were and so they said you should join us next time now the news anchor was trying to hate on them but they just made a joke out of it what's the coolest way to respond just make a joke out of it and what does he look like super Petty what do they look like fun and awesome and what did they do that next day record sales he chose to use his platform to direct attention to theirs for free didn't have to pay affiliate commissions what a steal we should only hope that someone bigger than us hates on us rule
(08:31) number one never attack back you cannot win by attacking you win by deflection or by amplifying above you never win in direct conflict when it comes to reputation now in the last box someone bigger than you tries to discredit you how do you respond so there's a mega influencer and I saw this influencer that I followed for many many years make all these posts about kind of denying this claim that they were getting attacked for so this was a lie that many people were trying to attack them with and it was specifically a competitor of
(09:02) theirs that was trying to defame them right really petty stuff but tough for that individual because they built their whole career off of this particular um truth I'm just going to read The Exchange to you I said uh can I suggest something I believe that brand is built on associations if I stand next to something and say I am not a pink elephant people will over enough time associate me and the Pink Elephant replace pink elephant with whatever you are claiming you are not think about that for a second this is me cutting to
(09:30) you who's listening or watching this right now if you keep saying I'm not that way I'm not that I'm not that all that people remember is you and that that's it so you keep repeating that and you actually feed into the narrative you're trying to disprove although well-intentioned I don't think these posts help you for context I didn't know you were dealing with this but then you drew my attention to it so you used your platform to increase awareness of your enemy's message the only way you could combat hate is to get louder you shrink
(09:57) them into irrelevance you don't win on logic you win by force because you'll never convince them you can make them so small they cease to matter take it or leave it just my opinion but I've studied brand deeply in creating mind from zero and I get plenty of hate and people who say I faked my business success and that I make up my numbers Etc I gain Nothing by drawing attention to them no one follows you because of this particular reason that that the person was worried about I said they follow you because of the value you
(10:27) provide them and let's face it even if someone did think that you weren't this one particular thing it doesn't affect them at all it doesn't change their behavior anyways I'm just saying this if you didn't reply nothing would happen your following won't stop growing you won't stop making sales only reply to people bigger than you I'm just giving you brand strategy if you want to respond I respect it I just tell you what I would do which is nothing focus on winning be louder take the anxious energy and put it into your megaphone
(10:57) about your mission another saying I like is they're not worth the skin off the back of your knuckles the law of large numbers makes it appear as though the world hates you humans aren't built to get this much feedback imagine you're 85 years old and saggy and no longer look how you do now will you care about this blip and I say this to say that if you get 500 hateful comments that's .
(11:21) 1% of your audience the other 99.9% love you focus on them and right now you're moving up and so that means the bigger the game the bigger the dragons also all these people based on the nature of this particular person the hate was also laced on the fact that they couldn't have done as well as they did without Faking It basically and so I said they're just complimenting you like that's all this hate fundamentally is so take that insult as a compliment instead it only bothers you because you choose to let it bother you and so I'd sent
(11:57) this particular person the story of uh Lela getting called to skinny [ __ ] by some dude who walked past her she was like did you hear that called me skinny and so even though the guy meant it as an insult she took it as a compliment which means the entire thing was just based on our subjective choice of how we choose to take these things and said so it only bothers you because you let it otherwise they're just sending you traffic they're choosing to promote you for free what a deal I said can you ask them to send some to me too I would just
(12:22) like the extra attention but let them know that I won't return the favor just to be clear I'm not sending my traffic to them so I finalized all of this stuff with just saying if it's true lean into it if it's false and they're smaller ignore it if it's false and they're bigger make them seem Petty and Beyond those actions you only win by getting louder you don't silence say you drown it out you only lose if you get quieter or you change your message and so you get quieter by not saying anything at all which in a way
(12:51) stops delivering value to your audience or you change the message you have to your audience because you're no longer providing value to them and directing them elsewhere in either scenario the only solution is value because the only thing anyone will care about is value and if they came there for the value they will stay there for the value and most times those people will attack the people who are trying to discredit you because they love the value that you give them and they don't want it to stop but no matter what no one keeps
(13:20) attacking someone who does not reply and if you just keep getting bigger and keep getting louder and keep providing more and more value you weather the storm it has happened every time in my life and I've had some crazy people come after me and you know what long enough time Rising Extinction curves always rule if you yell at a rock long enough you walk away yes even these big ones where it feels the worst where they're discrediting the biggest thing one 2 3 ignore agree one up if you can so somebody was being discredited so was an
(13:53) athlete for being not natural so being accused of taking steroids this was a girl now all these people are trying to attack her and I thought that the most elegant response that she could have done hey guys you got me I'm not natural my boobs are fake my hair it's actually a darker brown and my eyelashes peel them off these are actually fake too and hold on let me take this makeup remover thing and smear it off my face and yep I wear makeup too and so you got me the rumors are true I'm not natural I enhance my
(14:34) appearance and if she had said something like that that would have killed anything else someone else can say because she would have made a joke out of their attack and so if you're noticing an underlying theme with all of this the one thing that counters hate above everything else is humor and one of the alltime funny things that you can always always do is make fun of yourself and we should always be better at mocking ourselves than anyone else does why cuz we have more material and so just think about all the things that you can think of
(15:11) that are adjacent to the insult that they have so that you can agree with them and attack even more viciously than they are to yourself and then you will appear as the Class Act you will appear as more humble and they will have nothing to say back because no one kick someone who admits their quote faults or wrongs they look like the bad guy and then the conflict dissipates now I walked you through these examples but I want to give you a realistic representation of the proportion of times that I use 1 2 3 so if this is a
(15:50) pie chart where I use 1 two and three one being ignore two being agree three being agree and one up for those of you listening at home I just drew a big circle with the world's tiniest slice sliced out of it and that tiniest slice is two and three together 99% of my attention just goes to continuing to amplify my message people catastrophize the hate because it feels like ding we have a lot of strong social behavior that is bred into us like in the first things we do as a kid we get shamed and we correct our behavior and
(16:39) so when people say bad things about us we change it feels bad the problem with social media is that it amplifies that hate you get a lot of it and so we're not really built to take that kind of hate but what we can't comprehend is the law of large numbers that are associated if you have a million people who follow you and you get 500 people who hate you every single day it's 5% you could barely even see it on this graph but it feels like 500 people and that feels like so many but it's just it's just a very small percentage of a very large
(17:07) number the quote I say where you can only lose if you quit is true again here if you have reputation the only way that you can get canceled is if you choose to accept being cancelled or some external power makes it impossible for you to amplify your message meaning if you get deplatformed from everything and no platform allows you to post and they have ai that searches every video that anybody else makes about you and removes it automatically yeah you got canceled but short of that the only other way you get canceled
(17:41) is if you choose to accept being canceled and choose to stop making your message because on a long enough time rizon if you keep putting out the value that you have you keep announcing the message by percentage of the things that people are consuming more and more of it is the positive thing that you're talking about and so today it may seem like 50% of the news is bad but if you take today and then multiply it by 6 months and it's one day or two day or 5 days out of 180 days that 50% was about this negative thing and that
(18:13) all of the extra was you providing value providing value then that shrinks the amount of quote hate or negativity that you receive and the only way that you can solve it is through activity is through advertising in the literal sense by making your message known hate is a prerequisite for success just like Winston Churchill said you have enemies good you stood up for something sometime in your life the only people who get no hate are people who are invisible if you do nothing that is the only way to guarantee that you have no hate but if
(18:41) you stand for anything in your life there will be people who stand against you and it is in their nature to attack and that's okay and so I want to walk you through this because if you're dealing with one of these situations whether it's employee whether it's a customer whether it's a competitor or just somebody who just is envious of you the Playbook has already been written it's just hard to execute in the moment but the the more you do it the better you'll get at it and the tldr is remember that number one is still by far
(19:05) the biggest part of this which is you just keep doing you because if people know that they can control your behavior by pushing this button to get this response from you more people hit that button you actually let your audience know and you let your competitors know and your enemies know that you have cheat codes that they can dismantle you but if they can hit any button wherever they want as hard as they want and you're going to keep doing you you become very hard to beat

If I Wanted to Monetize An Audience in 2025, This is What I Would Do - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oRqnTOT9ZG8

Transcript:
(00:00) in my second company Prestige Labs I built up to over 5,000 Affiliates that generated 20 plus million dollar a year in revenue and that business continues to this day in Allen my software company which was my third big company we built up to over a thousand Affiliates that were agencies white labeling that software for my book launch for $100 million leads we got 30,000 Affiliates who promoted the actual book launch I've also invested in companies that I've personally endorsed and so I bring all these things up because most people
(00:29) don't know how to quote monetize an audience and after talking to a lot of creators or celebrities and influencers and also business owners who want to do deals with those people a lot of people don't share a construct in terms of thinking through how to make those deals happen and so I wanted to make this video to outline the four ways that I see those deals happening and the combinations between them and what considerations you might have whether you're on the doing the deal side of having an audience or being the person
(00:58) who wants to quote buy license rent the audience from an influencer or somebody who has those eyeballs all right so four ways to monetize an audience let's use a good marker that doesn't suck step one have good markers four ways to monetize and audience all right now right off the bat number one we've got Affiliates which is what I was saying earlier the second way that you can monetize an audience is through sponsorships some people call these endorsements the third way that you can do this is through Partnerships which usually involve
(01:53) equity and the fourth way that we can do this through starting your own if you're the influencer in this instument all right so we have Affiliates which is where you are getting paid after you make sales for a business sponsorships where they pay you first to advertise on behalf of the business and typically endorse it via your brand Partnerships where you go into a business that already has a product already has an infrastructure and you do one of these two things or a combination of these two things for equity and so the behavior
(02:30) avors between affiliate sponsorships and Partnerships are more or less the same the difference is simply how you get compensated and then the fourth is where you just start your entirely owned brand to then promote to your audience all right so let's break down which of these and kind of where they sit on the Continuum and the reason I want to bring this up is because I'm having so many conversations with people who are like I have this audience I've built it for four years I just don't know what to do and so I think of these four on a
(02:55) Continuum all right and I can think of this Continuum in terms of difficult ult and risk and value all right and so on this side you've got the Affiliates this is the fastest way that you could immediately make money most businesses that have affiliate programs you can sign up automatically they have predetermined uh terms that are associated with this agreement and as unless you do something that's really you know nefarious or weird they're happy to have you sell their stuff so one is this one's fastest this is
(03:29) lowrisk for kind of both parties because if you are an affiliate and you're promoting it like they don't have to pay you until after you make a sale now for you you also don't get capped and so if you can make a ton of sales and you feel like you're being undervalued then you just get to prove that you are actually good at promoting and that your audience is actually a good fit for whatever that product is but from a value perspective so I call it exit value affiliate revenue streams are not typically that valuable so they will
(04:01) contribute to the sellability of the company but the majority of that value would come in the terms of a multiple of the cash flow that you're receiving as an affiliate multiplied or discounted by how reliable the business that you're doing business with is and so if I'm an affiliate of the US government you know what I mean and I recruit people for the military then I probably can say that my business model is sound and the US government is not going to go away I'm not getting not notwithstanding you know theories and whatnot all right but by
(04:29) and large it's be a trustworthy third party on the flip side if I have some you know info thing that is going to disappear tomorrow because there's some Arbitrage opportunity that your business opportunity then this is going to be basically have no value because that business that underlines that cash flow has no value all right and so we're moving along here so this is the lowest value probably middle work lowish risk for you all right the next is you've got sponsorships so sponsorships is where someone pays
(05:03) you first all right so you receive cash and then you make the endorsement and so usually this is in two forms you advertise to your audience and the reason I say advertise rather than here it sell here you only get paid after people buy with sponsorships you get paid first and so that means that you are advertising you're a traffic source for the business and so you will get paid as a traffic Source typically based on cpms meaning cost per Impressions that you can have in terms of views to an audience now these sponsorships come in the form of
(05:36) you posting stuff to your audience which for them they see this as free traffic they're technically paying for it but you're monetizing the traffic that you have the other way which is the more scalable way is something called whitelisting which is basically them taking whatever your posts are and then running them as ads and so let's say I have a million person audience I make a post and only you know 200,000 people see it and as most content creators would do you wouldn't want to post over and over again about that thing because
(06:06) it would kind of be like oh this guy's just promoting this thing over and over again it wouldn't feel good right and so you might make a post or two every so often to not interrupt the value that you're providing to your audience too much and so the way to solve this really for both parties is you make an advertisement saying hey I just partnered with so and so their thing is awesome I've actually been using it for years finally came to an agreement I think you guys might like it check it out right and so that wh listing then
(06:32) allows them to blast it to people way outside of your audience I like this a lot as a win-win because the business pays money to advertise your brand so they make you bigger and they're spending money to advertise you but at the same time they get higher conversion rate because you're probably better on camera you're better spoken and you already have a certain amount of warm audience that recognize you at least your face or your mannerisms so you convert it a higher percentage so the business makes money you grow your brand
(06:58) this is a really nice partnership now these deals sponsorships are harder to come by than affiliate deals because most affiliate companies just have a program an influencer program an affiliate program and you just sign up on the standard terms sponsorships tend to be more allak cart depending on the size of the influencer relative to the size of the company and so for extreme examples if you're a huge influencer and there's a tiny company you'll be able to get an amazing sponsorship deal if it's a huge company like Nike and you're a
(07:26) small influencer you might not get any deal and you still wear their stuff and so it's really the balance between who has how much leverage in the negotiation which brings us to the fourth one or sorry the third one which is Partnerships all right now as we move along here sponsorships also don't have kind of like Affiliates huge exit value the only place that sponsorships really become exit valuable exit value for a business is if you have a True Media company now if you're a personal brand it's really tough to exit your personal brand
(08:00) but if I have an army of influencers and I negotiate deals through my network and say hey uh you know paps Blue Ribbon or you know Budweiser whatever I have a thousand influencers that fit your ideal profile for customers and I'll negotiate an umbrella deal and then all of them are forced because the have with them to promote your stuff now you have a media company which is very similar to a talent agency slightly different but has a lot of similarities and so then then that sponsorship revenue is really the
(08:29) main revenue of your business which is that you sell traffic at a discount right but for the for the influencer individually these two things very hard to sell not really sellable not much now once we get into this side these deals get harder and harder to do and you do fewer and fewer of them as you go down this line so a partnership can either be a minority deal or a majority deal again if you're going to go partner with a company and you're huge and they're tiny then it might be a a majority deal if they're huge and your tiny relative to
(09:02) them then it might be a minority deal meaning you're not going to get all of the company and that can range from you know 0.1% of the business all the way to you getting you know 99% of the business in terms of the range and so anything that you can imagine in terms of economics here is going to be negotiable but one of the thing or some of the things that I would consider here is performance which is this is again for both parties you can have Equity as the form of compensation rather than necessarily cash and you say hey if I bring you an
(09:33) extra thousand customers I get you know 1% per th000 customers that I bring you to the platform or whatever and then you put a cap on that at some point where you say up to to you know 10% great and so that way it's a little bit balanced for you and for the business now one of the considerations that you have to have if you were the uh content creator or the influencer is that the the the Association that you make with their brand is permanent as soon as you make that public decoration you transfer all of that Goodwill you transfer that
(10:06) Association to them and so if you are going to do a deal like this my recommendation is that you want to have at least something upfront so no matter what for doing this deal you get some amount of this Equity up front and then some percentage that's based on performance now the one of the last components that I'll say and there's obviously a lot of ways that you can do deals but these are just the things that I think through is time and so somebody who's on the business owner side is like well I don't want you
(10:33) to just make one Association I want you to keep doing this for a long period of time and so they can take some of this Equity that they want to give you and say all right I'm going to give you you know 25% of your Equity upfront I'm going to give you uh 25% based on performance and I'm going to give you 50% over time and so I want you to promote for the next four years and if for some reason something happens then you're not going to get that vesting because we had some sort of breakup right and so whenever I think through
(10:59) these terms I just like to think through all the W's which is who what where when why how right which is okay I want you to post and if you're the content grator you should be asking that same thing which is how much do you want me to post right and about what and you have to take into consideration that you have to keep building your brand right and so you don't want to just be like all of a sudden some shill like that's not good you want to Tastefully be able to integrate that promotion into the content that you have and so You' have
(11:24) to say okay well I think the best way for us to do this is for me to you know put uh your links in my my bio and I'll put it up for one week of the month and I will make one long form thing that mentions it and you know five short form things via posts or stories and then when you define that and the reason this is so important is that you define that stuff up front so that it's just very clear don't just say like I will promote the business and whatnot because it just doesn't work as well and you might say I
(11:50) will also you know record ads once a month that you can then use for wh listing and so all of these things and this is where this gets more nuanced in Deal making is is you can be a partner and still have affiliate Revenue you can be a partner and still get paid from a sponsorship perspective and so these things are not mutually exclusive but like you might have a primarily sponsorship deal with some element of equity but I will say on a personal level the more money you have right now the more you want to lean this way
(12:18) because the equity the sponsorship cash that you choose to take you do at the expensive equity and if you believe in the product and you believe that the company is exit in the future then in my opinion it makes sense to delay it for the little bit longer run but this takes on more risk because here you get paid today no matter what here you might not ever get paid if the company doesn't sell and so by taking on more risk you want to make sure that you're getting a disproportionate reward in the in the form of stock shares options equity and
(12:46) things like that all right and so as we're walking through this and you're thinking okay how can I monetize my brand it's like okay the first level I can do Affiliates and just promote other people's stuff and get paid for it the next level I can be a media source for them I can be traffic for them via sponsor ship right these are a little bit more nuanced deals taking another step I can actually partner with the brand and say Hey I want to own 1% 5% 10% 50% depending on how big you are and how big your audience is and then
(13:13) finally you can start your own brand and when I say brand I say that all inclusive in terms of products and brand and when you do this you can either white label which which means you go to somebody who manufactures stuff already and say can you slap my logo on it which is an option and the other option is that you do custom formulations custom I'll just say custom stuff all right and so if I were selling supplements for example I might go to a a company that already has a product that's done and I just say hey I want to
(13:46) slap my label on it on the custom version of this it's like hey I want this gram of this we're going to test out flavors together and we're going to put it together make a custom product that no one else has same things works with merchandise so if you said hey I want to get a white T-shirt and you just try six different white t-shirts that people have off the shelf that are manufacturers they say okay just slap my logo on it let's go or you say hey what are the different Fabrics what are the different materials that I can put
(14:09) together these are the cuts that I want to look at this is how I want it to fit right that becomes more custom and so white label is faster and easier from a speed perspective but usually me personally I prefer to do custom stuff because I don't like anyone else being able to sell something that's identical to me and be able to have any kind of pricing power over what I have because the moment that people find out that you just have a generic product that you slap the label on it just does it's not a good look right and so again I don't
(14:38) think there's anything like I want to be clear I don't think there's anything wrong with doing white label I just think that if we were to put this on this sphere like white label would be here and custom would be here but if you're going to take the risk on of starting your own brand I might as well get all the benefits of doing it but this costs more money white label tends to Cost Less because you don't have to get custom templates custom forms and pay and incur all those costs costs because someone else their whole
(15:01) business is based around doing this for other people all right now the difference here is that for all of these situations you're going to promote stuff that already exists here you're starting the thing from Ground Zero which means that you're on the other side of the table now you start with 100% equity and then you start paying people this way down the line and so if you are an influencer you have an audience or you're a business owner and you're trying to make deals with influencers this is how I think through this and I
(15:33) try and see there are elements that you can borrow from each of these kind of verticals to tweak the deal to make it right for everyone and so I think about it in terms of what's the exit value what cash is going to be going in or out of the business how much work is the person going to do and then how much risk am I or are they exposed to and by balancing those four things you can usually navigate along this Continuum to find the right part the right deal that's right for you and the product that's it

How To Close Everyone Downselling Like A Pro (ALEX HORMOZI) - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gza5RtQCVsA

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on everyone welcome back uh quick uh little tactical training for you today as well um how to close everyone down selling like a prop so one of the big beliefs that i like to set in our community is that everyone buys something what i mean by that is that everyone has some money right no matter what and everyone has this problem and we should find a way to help everyone to a certain degree right and obviously you want to try and sell your primary program because that's going to be your objective that's because you think it's
(00:24) the thing that's going to help them the most etc but there come times where people can't afford it for whatever reason right this is reality all right anyone tells you otherwise whatever full of it so in the real world of sales understanding how to down sell like a champ is one of the reasons that you'll be able to massively increase your pro your close rate now doing it properly is one of the key is one of the key points here all right so when you do it poorly it sounds like begging and it sounds like you totally
(00:52) lose your frame uh in the sale and now you sound desperate and aggressive and clingy and you sound like you've got i love this term commission breath and and basically just ruins the sale and then they don't even if they could afford it they don't want to buy from you because of what you're doing right it sounds unethical etc like wait you just said it was this price you're just going to keep lowering it and so the key to doing this is having a key set of cards that you have in your back pocket that you can choose to play
(01:18) as you go down right so it's kind of like a step down all right and the way that you do this is through exchange all right so one of the other powerful influences in human psychology and jet in general is is reciprocity all right we have a very hard time uh if someone gives you something not giving something back the beautiful thing is is that after you exchange something the person who sets the terms always has the power in the agreement so for example um if someone asks me to do something which is essentially what they're doing
(01:48) when they say no they can't afford that they're asking you to do something for them right can you do it for less that's that's the implication right they can't do it for that what else can you do and so uh there's a study that like showed this enough i mean there's hundreds of studies that show this but where they took people in colleges and they let them uh cut in line and the thing is is that doing a small favor people don't have a good idea of what of what it get like equality in an exchange is and so if you do a small
(02:17) favor for someone and after you do the small favor then make a big ask it's still very hard for people to say no all right and so that's the thing is that people don't have with reciprocity an idea of fairness of exchange there all right like it's like hey yeah remember i bought you lunch yesterday uh can you take me to the airport and back this weekend or can you help me move out of my apartment like that's not a fair exchange but the thing is is that with reciprocity people will say yes to things because of just underlying human
(02:47) psychology all right so here's how you use reciprocity which is one of the strongest things motivators for persuasion in a down selling environment all right so after let's say you you offer your your primary program you're like hey it's you know it's x right and they're like i i just can't afford that so he says this you say tell you what i'll do it for this if you xyz right if you leave me a testimonial so i'll drop the price in half if you leave me a testimonial fair enough and when you say that it's like they asked
(03:20) you to make a a a some sort of adjustment you take that in consideration you make the adjustment and you make the offer again and you say does that sound fair right and the thing is is it's very difficult for people to keep hearing that over and over again and not say yes so i'll give you an example one of the step downs that we use that's really successful and so let's say we're selling a front end program for 300 all right for 300 bucks a week very straightforward three weeks all right so they say no they say you
(03:46) know that's too much for me to say no problem what if we just did 49 weeks for 12 weeks right with a commitment and so we're doing is that you always have these you always have these cards that you can play so in a fitness example right you have the term so how long they're committing to that's number one number two you can ask them to give you a testimonial you can ask them to give you reviews you can ask them to bring a friend and each of these things are things that you can ask them to do so that you can ethically lower the price
(04:13) because you're asking them to do more all right on top of that you can also add bonuses in the original package i don't like removing bonuses as much because like i want to give them those things um and so it's more like i'll i'd rather go in the other direction of asking them to do more things for me um and that way if someone else is like why is she paying x and i'm paying z you can say well she's doing some extra things for me that you're not and they're like oh and so that way you're not saying like two people are having different prices
(04:41) for the same program because you've made additional terms to the agreement right so traditional step down be like hey can you do this thing for 2.99 they say no you say awesome no worries uh you know what i can just cut the price in half and if you can just commit to 12 weeks fair enough they say no and you say okay no worries let's just not even worry about the commitment just get you started today for 49 bucks fair enough they say no you say all right and you have to acknowledge that it gets kind of increasingly ridiculous as you make more
(05:10) and more offers right in it in a light tone because it's still going to pull on that internal mechanism inside of people to take action and say yes okay so we started we've already done two drop downs we did half price with commitment then we removed commitment 49 all right we're 49 and we were limited commitment that's two step downs all right step underneath that you're like all right how about this i'll do it for 39 if you leave me a testimonial at the end fair enough and also when you have the testimonial
(05:37) you're also putting another implication that they're going to get results so you're selling while you're while you're down selling at the same time right now you've said three down cells fair enough they're like no i still can't do it you're like all right cool let's just get you kicked off at 29 dollars a week pay as you go don't worry about it uh and just bring a friend in the first 30 days all right that way i can at least cover my costs and that way it gets me to at least half price what i was saying before fair enough
(06:02) it's hard for someone to hear that make have you make all of these uh what is it accommodations for them and not say yes three four five six times and be very clear about how you're asking for this don't just say sound good sound great cool that's not the call to action the call to action when you're down selling i mean i really like this in general what i'm selling is fair enough sound fair because you're lowering the bar to just say yeah that sounds fair you're like awesome great what card you want to use let's get you started right
(06:38) if you want you can even transition is really cool do you want to do your uh you know nutrition appointment in the morning or the afternoon so you're already taking more micro steps in the right commitment before you ask the card if you want to do that all right but i'll go i'll go through this one more time for everyone who's listening so primary offer it's 2.
(06:54) 99 it's got all this amazing stuff uh fair enough no okay no worries um what we can do is if the price is enough but you really still want this if you if you want to just go longer which you're probably gonna need anyways right um i'll do it for 49 a week which is half of what i said earlier all right fair enough and when you're asking this you have to ask it like you actually want them to say yes and that's why the tonality is so important don't just like read the script and be like sound fair like you have to be like fair enough like you
(07:22) have to really you have to ask it like you're actually asking them to say yes i know this sounds minor but it's everything over the phone when you don't have your body to make so that they can see because only nine percent of communication is verbal right and everything else is how you say the words not just the words you're saying right i can give you another example of like how i can take one sentence and make it mean like six things by how you say it all right sale is the same thing so big program they say no commitment at half price fair
(07:50) enough they say no you say listen don't worry about it i get it sometimes it can be scary how about this i'll just let you get started for day pays you go i'll prove myself all right we don't have to get married we can just start first date right uh 49 all right fair enough you got to really wait for it and they're like ah you're like okay you're killing me that's okay no worries we'll get this started all right we'll figure this out together the thing is is that when you're doing this it's collaborative you're on the same side of the table
(08:18) saying let's figure out a way to make this work right because if you have built the rapport throughout the sale you've dug the pain right so they know that this is something that they need to do and they know they need to do it with you they will work with you as long as you've maintained rapport and you don't get aggressive right and so you're like okay no worries how about this i'll do it for 39 a week all right so it's 25 off of my already 50 off right uh if you just leave me a testimonial at the end fair enough
(08:45) it's hard for like it's hard for people to keep saying no to that and you're like okay 39. all right i'll do all right this is this is the this is the the best i can do all right because at this point i'm pretty much paying you to work out all right so it's i can do this for 29 all right just send me a friend in the first 30 days that way at least um i can get back to the 49 that that just at least covers my costs fair enough we say it like that you see how the tonality changes right they're like man this guy's really trying to help me out
(09:14) he's really trying to accommodate me and so when you drop down that many like at this point we're at six drop downs okay so so this person all right um if they say no at this point then in my opinion it's not a money thing you lost them earlier on in the sale and they're trying to get off and at some point earlier on they became disengaged with the phone call right that's where you get the hey can i get the credit card they hang up right it's because they're just done with the conversation they just want they just
(09:37) want to get off the phone right in person they can't just get off the phone you have a little bit more fighting room over the phone it's not that way right and so these are the things and that's why you have to confront the obstacles earlier on like someone's disengaged they're not paying attention they're giving you surface level problems that's really like hey can i be real with you instead of nice to you and then you deliver the deliver the pain like hey i'm not saying that to make you feel bad all right i'm saying
(10:01) that so i can help right and so when you say that it's like you've you've given yourself permission to inject the truth rub the pain a little bit but then you you put a band-aid on it afterwards all right and so anyway that's that's that's earlier on objections i won't get into that right now um but knowing how to down sell will massively increase your crows rate and by adding these little cards that you have that you can trade with people on allows you to have flexibility in the deal right and then that way they can
(10:29) feel like you accommodated them you still help them and then ultimately what you're doing is just trying to get your foot in the door because in seven days and 14 days they're finally going to trust you and then they'll buy the full the full price program later like don't worry about it it's just like let's get you going let's get you in the in our world so that we can provide value and then after that we'll make it work all right so uh two cents on down selling you need to know how to downsell and you know how to do it ethically without
(10:52) sounding like you're begging or being pushy and that's how you do it all right lots of everyone if you like this drop a comment drop a review drop you know drop of whatever engage with this um and uh have a have a miraculous wednesday all right catch you soon bye [Music] you

Transcript:
(00:00) become wealthy the moment you decide you are because you will realize at some point that money will buy you freedom will not buy you happiness i was talking to an entrepreneur the other day and we were talking about living expenses and one of the things that a lot of our portfolio companies struggle with is when to decide to start spending money right it's very difficult because we a lot of times as entrepreneurs especially those that that grow their businesses many times they've been taught not to spend money which i
(00:23) think is the right you know lesson overall to get to get started right if you define that as like the optimal convert material wealth you know on the flip side there's also some people who struggle to ever get ahead and they're always living paycheck to paycheck even when they have a lot of money and i know i have some friends who uh you know they're in their 50s and uh have always made very very high incomes and have spent virtually every dollar and now they regret it and so i don't think there's anything wrong with spending all
(00:44) the money that you have i do think that it is not ideal for material wealth accumulation if that is the goal but you may enjoy your life that way so it's really i think a balancing act between those things and so i thought it might be fun to make a video um about how my living expenses changed from you know dollar zero uh to now we do you know over 100 million dollars a year at acquisition.
(01:03) com um and if you're new to the channel i make these videos just because i want to help and i hope that these things can help you get to three million dollars more so potentially partner with your business and help you get to 30 and beyond all right but otherwise i have no coaching mentorships or anything like that that i sell and i make these videos because i enjoy doing it okay let's dive in so you know season one here was alex quitting his job and sleeping on the floor all right and so i tried to write out each of these phases or seasons of my life kind of like the
(01:25) outcome the income and kind of the the expenses i was incurring at the time all right so i slept on the gym floor so i had no rent besides my business rent but i know personal rent uh my car payment i was not existing because i had my car in cash um and i actually only lived exclusively on the cash sales from the business that was actually my living money which for me was a combination of eating in and out in chipotle and that was it uh my accountant actually told me that my i did done 500 over 500 transactions at chipotle uh that first
(01:50) year and he was like that's insane i was like well i don't buy groceries and i don't cook so i just i ate out always and that worked out for me so it was actually for me cheaper than all the time and i just stayed at work and i slept there and that was kind of it right and so anyways even during that time i was able to increase my income to about 15 000 a month but i i tend to be very security driven and i've noticed that by myself so i like to make a lot more than i'm spending right and the reason i'm making this video too is that
(02:11) like some people will see us you know fly private or they'll see us eat out you know many many many or every night of the week and think oh that's what i should do now i should emulate that i think i wanted to actually show kind of the come up of what kind of expenses you know expenses income ratio looked like for me over the last 10 years uh to hopefully you know provide some clarity uh for those of you who at least are trying to emulate the path um and if you're not then don't emulate this path but this is what worked for me okay now
(02:33) at this point i had two partners into the scene and we stopped taking dividends and we started investing in the growth of the business overall so you can see here that's when i went from you know one to six gyms and i really took no dividends in that period of time and i had saved this up for about six months so i had about seventy thousand dollars total saved up after taxes from that first you know six to nine months of doing business and at that point that was it and i lived on that for three years that cash lasted me for three
(02:57) years which is again probably why i'm so security driven um because i know what it's like to live on nothing and so my my car was still in cash so i had no car payments and i did up my lifestyle uh to renting a room and uh it wasn't actually me running a room for contacts i actually had a true roommate so it was a house there were seven people lived in the house and i split one room and so this was in southern california and my rent was i think it was 700 a month it might have been 400.
(03:21) it was 400 to 700 in there and it was a house in costa mesa and i literally had another guy who slept in there with me and we split it all right so mind you like i'm reinvesting all my cash in growing these in this business but my personal expenses were virtually zero the only thing i spent money on was going out to ebola and that was it right that was literally all i spent money on and i had this shared room okay now i did that for three years all right so i can say three years really easily but it took three years of my life uh of this little
(03:43) season here now the next season that happened was i bought a condo and i bought a condo because i really liked the condo i thought it was you know well priced and whatnot and uh i lived there for a very short period of time and then i realized that i could rent it for 3 500 a month so that's what i ended up renting the condo for and then that's when layla and i started doing gym turnarounds so you used to fly around and do these launches right and so these launches at that time from business perspective got us to about 200 300 a
(04:06) month now that was uh revenue my income was still very very low uh and that's because again i didn't take distributions because i didn't learn that lesson yet all right so for those of you who are like taking notes at home there's multiple periods of those who know my story i've lost everything in between here multiple times and so that is why i'm so big on taking distributions as you grow because at the end of the day risk is a real thing and um i had spent years of my life building something only to lose it and i didn't
(04:27) want to make that mistake again and so this was yet again another one of those mistakes where i did um and i did these turnarounds and i lived at the extended stay here for 1800 a month all right so my rent expense was 1800 a month uh we lived uh we had a car that we owned in cash which was the prius during this period of time and that was it that was the only expenses was the extended stay and then us eating you know chipotle and stuff and layla was uh kind enough to deal with me eating chipotle during this
(04:50) entire period of time and so we got the business about 200 300 100 000 a month there was a bunch of logistical issues with the business it was low margin there's a lot of operational complexity i was learning right so then from there um we said you know what maybe we should settle down and that's when we switch to having sales teams fly out and do this stuff uh you know on our on our behalf and do the gym turnouts and we could stay central so that's where we moved to albuquerque because we had friends in albuquerque that we wanted to learn from
(05:12) and our rent there was 200 a month okay uh the car we owned in cash which was prius so aka hashtag mozymobiles those of you who are you know valuing uh your business over your uh personal expenditures and we ate out uh eight out out once a week and this is actually when we switched to um to meal prepping excuse me so uh leila started cooking because we had a kitchen uh that was like regular and it wasn't just like an extended steak kitchen so she started cooking which was awesome and uh we ate out once a week for like a date night
(05:35) because that's what we believed what we had to do then was have a date night which we have since uh changed the way we do things but at that time that was the one kind of big expense of the week because we would eat out car was in cash 1200 a month was our rent and here's what's crazy during this period of time the business went from the turnaround business at 300 000 a month to 1.
(05:52) 5 million a month all right and these were my living expenses so i was saving and this is really saving i was adding a million dollars to my personal bank account every month all right uh and by i i mean we all right and so this is when we started to really create a lot of wealth very quickly and mind you like we didn't live on a lot of money still all right and i think when we had about i wanna say we had like shoot i wanna say we had four to six million saved up after taxes at this point and that's when in cash we bought a 1.8 million
(06:20) house we bought the 120 million dollar house in cash uh in austin which uh was a really good deal at the time for that particular house we still split one car it was she owned in cash and this car now got upgraded it was an i8 which was a gift from clickfunnels for being an affiliate um so i got the car for free and they basically paid us to buy the car it doesn't matter but the point is i didn't have i didn't have car payments um for the car and this time we still ate out actually less frequently than in albuquerque because we were like super
(06:44) intense in work mode this is where we overindexed on trying to build the enterprise and build the business during that period of time and um i don't want to say i regret that i think it was a necessary lesson i think we did not have nearly as much fun as we probably could have but layla and i were so afraid of losing what we had built and so you know we it was just like we just didn't want to mess it up and so we just wanted to work all the time because we were just so afraid it was very fear drivens though now two or three years in uh at
(07:06) this point we brought we uh we bought an additional car which was a bentley um i talked to bradley and i talked to berkustio friends of ours and uh they were like dude you gotta spend some money and i was like alright so we bought a fancy car and i realized quickly that we uh didn't care and so we sold it within six months we lost money on the car and uh we were happier for it and so uh it's just we realized it just didn't matter to us it just sat in the driveway and getting uh an expensive car fixed we had a teenager ding the thing
(07:29) the bumper and it was you know in the shop for three months of the six and it was ultimately just a pain in the ass now that being said still during this period of time uh you know the the bentley was the only really expensive thing we bought the house was in cash so i had no house payment the car was in cash there no car payment and the only real expenses we had it at that that period of time was eating out one to two times a month that was literally it all right and during that time our revenue increased from 1.5 million a month to
(07:50) over four million a month in that period of time and our wealth continued to uh to grow because everything that was in excess from the income perspective just poured straight into our savings all right so that was for context during that period of time i think we accumulated around i want to say 30 million dollars after taxes in in cash and assets or you know cash equivalents things like that and so it was really just savings right we didn't sell anything at that point that's kind of where we're at at that chapter all right
(08:11) now at that point now mind you this was like cash stuff there's the equities in the business that obviously uh were worth more than that um but that was just straight dividends and i think an important part there is like i i learned to take dividends because i realized that i was giving myself an excuse by reinvesting every dollar of cash flow into the business which a lot of times meant that i just wasn't really focused on profitability and um i think that sometimes that's a business strategy it's very rarely the right one um and a
(08:34) lot of times just having a sustainable growth path where you can de-risk yourself by taking cash off the table because let's say uh covid happened for example and you know our companies had gone down which they did and thankfully we had very strong businesses that were able to sustain that even though they were in heavily hit industries this gave us a very good peace of mind to know that we could cash for the company if we needed to and we could keep everything alive for as long as it lasted and you know we thought it was going to be 12
(08:56) weeks and then it was two years right and so that's why i'm a big fan of de-risking and living cheap now you're like well that's not living cheap alex thing is that relative to my income and this is why i wanted to make these videos for context right yes we lived in a 1.8 million dollar house and yes you know we sold the house for 4 million two and a half years later like so it was an expensive it was a nice house in a nice neighborhood but like we could buy our house in cash every month off of our income all right so like this is what i
(09:18) feel like is lost sometimes in the podcasts and interviews that i talk about and sometimes like oh you eat now you eat out oh you private and it's like yes but like i'm so security driven and i just want to convey that i'm not saying you have to be i'm saying this is work for me all right and so we were able to accumulate about 30 million bucks in cash between like real estate and stocks i would say like non-business equities um or non-public market equities uh during that period of time all right now after that um those of you
(09:42) some of you know is that in 2021 uh we sold everything so we sold our three businesses we sold two cars we sold the house we sold everything actually we sold one car we were going to sell the other car i think we kept it so excuse that so that should just be one we were planning on selling two we sold one was the belly sorry to interrupt if you guys have been joining the content and have any questions about what you've seen so far go ahead and drop the questions in the comments below so that i can answer them in future videos and provide more
(10:02) value to you keep enjoying the video continue all right so we sold everything so we had no personal assets all right we had business assets and investment assets we know personal assets at that time and so then we started running a condyle the one that we are currently in for 15 grand a month we spend about 15 000 a month on food and eating out we don't cook much and that's just from a time perspective and it's also for us the end of the day is kind of like where we unwind and so we work from pretty early morning until about four or five
(10:23) o'clock then we got to dinner at six we get back home at 7 30. lately and i probably watch a show and then we go to bed and we do it all over again and so that's that's our day that's what we do it might be like that's really boring yeah probably i don't know we like it and so that's what we do so we spend 15 15 a month on food probably fifteen thousand dollars a month on travel i will say this i flew private more during this season that's a plane there you go there's my plane uh we flew private more during this season
(10:46) than we do now and that's because we found something that i think uh gives us confers from a benefit to cost ratio many of the advantages of private uh but it's uh it's public so we actually fight jsx now for anything that is on the west coast which is basically like semi-private travel it's cool it's like you know you can have like three to you know 15 other people on the plane with you and you and it has all the same benefits of private which is you roll up straight to the plane 10 minutes before it takes off you literally get right
(11:12) into the plane and then it lands and then you walk straight to a car uh so it just saves so much time and it's marginally more expensive than a normal ticket i think some of the tickets are like 200 to 400 bucks it's not expensive and so we have opted to do it to flying on that airline rather than private um and this is not sponsored by jsx but i you know i would endorse them because they're great and so we stopped we stopped flying private because you know spending 50 000 on a plane flight if i can get basically the same benefit for
(11:33) 400 uh is worth it and so again this is one of those like we flew private because it saved us time and it turned travel from a negative into a positive but jsx i think accomplishes all that and i never cared about having other people on the plane i just cared about getting places faster not having to get hassled um and jsx accomplishes that so i mean we're we we pretty much always fly those now um everywhere we go and almost if anything uh we we try and fly places where they go which is wonderful and you know during this period of time
(11:58) where we're currently at you know uh acquisition.com i say in the videos you know we're doing over a hundred million dollars a year but right now we're over 150 but just for the sake of you know not making the number change every time the businesses grow we grew from about seven million dollars a month to uh 13 million a month between the portfolio companies in that period of time and so i show this to show that you know i don't think our lifestyles have increased at the proportion that our income has and i think that's because
(12:19) layla are both very security driven um as individuals and that works for us and i want to have kind of one final point that i'll make here that uh hopefully you can take away from this is that if the goal is material wealth accumulation then the lower your personal expense is the more you will accumulate right and your peace of mind will be predicated on the ratio between your income and your expenses right if you can make enough in a month or a year to give yourself another multiple years of living then you go towards your fu number as fast as
(12:49) possible so you know there's two variables there how much you make and how much you spend now at some point people are like well i'd like to increase my expenditures i think that's natural and i think that's normal and i think the thing that i would push against which is why we have uh you know a hashtag that went pretty uh pretty viral which is mosey mobiles uh we'll probably have mosey mansions too i'll probably start that one uh maybe i'll show an image of what our 1200 apartment looked like but it's it's really less
(13:10) about living cheap and more about spending money on the things that you value rather than what society's told us to value right and so for me the equity growth of my businesses i valued more than having a lambo or having a bentley and for me i just don't get a lot of value from it now some people might and that's okay i just think that it's really good to think consciously am i buying this because i want status from other people or because i really think that this thing converts value right same thing with flying private for
(13:31) example at least for us the decision calculus has changed recently just because i just discovered this um for the last few months we've been flying jsx and honestly i love it it's great i you know i the benefits of value ratio uh has diminished now that i have an alternative that is you know 1 100th of the price of private and confers almost all the benefits that i enjoyed i say this to say i am all about wealth and wealth is the ratio between income and expenses and the peace of mind that you have from knowing that you have enough
(13:54) and so for me my goal was to get to enough as fast as possible so that i could feel that peace of mind um everything we do now is just for love of the game which is why the podcast is called the game which is why i make these videos and just to see like what would it look like to get to a billion uh because that sounds really exciting and epic and fun and at the same time as i'm super invested and motivated to get there i'm okay if we never do uh and i don't even want to say that because i do 100 believe that we're gonna get there
(14:15) but it's it's really about playing the game and i think that that has been i think the goal if i have for mozzie nation is that everyone can get to a point where they're just playing the game for the love of the game not for the lambo or for the mansion or for the whatever because i can tell you that those are moments and those are fleeting and so i think it's much more of a process of becoming rather than obtaining and i think that if we can make that switch we get to experience a lot of the benefits of the wealth
(14:34) because wealth occurs or you become wealthy the moment you decide you are because you will realize at some point that money will buy you freedom will not buy you happiness and so if the goal is you know first the goal is freedom short but then you're free to experience the feelings that you have and you'll realize that it was not that thing but it can absolutely decrease pain and inconvenience in your life and so i can obviously i am somebody who's gone after material wealth accumulation in my life so i don't want to say that like it's
(14:56) not something that i find interesting fun and stimulating i don't even know what i would do if this game didn't exist but it's really just to take pause and think like are these things that i'm buying really adding more value than the price that i'm incurring to purchase them and i think many times people purchase things without thinking that extra taking that extra second to pause and say like am i really getting 500 value from this shoe am i really getting 2 000 from this belt am i really getting xyz now you can do this relative to your
(15:19) income right like it's not unreasonable to live on a million dollars a year if you make 15 million a year right it's not it's actually less and here's what's crazy it's less to live on a million dollars a year when you make 15 than it is to live on 100 when you make 400 right it's about the ratio between income and expenses and so we can control our expenses into it and also we can control our income based on getting more skills which is why i've been a very loud advocate for spending as much of your extra dollars on
(15:44) acquiring more skills so that you can increase your capacity to earn and when you do that you can accelerate towards that wealth discrepancy between income and expenses at a faster rate and then ultimately achieve the peace of mind that i think most of us are after anyways mosey nation um i love you guys i appreciate you i don't deserve this audience that you guys have come together you guys are amazing and i just i'm so grateful that this channel and the other you know social media accounts and things like that thank you guys for all the support

Transcript:
(00:00) an audience of business owners ask me questions for four hours here are the best moments uh I own a company that uh basically Scoops up dog sweet uh I love these typ of business no one cancels yeah we got we're doing about 2 million a year and I want to get to 10 million a year as fast as possible uh poo poo The Profit sorry go ahead's uh and our business it's it's somewhat seasonal as far as the acquisition goes we basically double every first quarter of the year when all the St is melting off and everything uh but through the
(00:30) rest of the year I want to uh start looking at acquiring other dog companies basically uh uh so my question is when you're going to acquire other companies how do you integrate it with your company to uh basically not let your money on fire and to maximize the Enterprise value for an investor so obviously the the is going to be a huge and how you structure the de um are you keeping the operators on afterwards or no uh probably depend on the uh on the business and the deal I would have some sort of big incentive for them to
(01:05) have bonus basically post integration and so that way they're going to be highly incentivized to you know you put hey like we're in this together if this doesn't work then you're not going to get paid um and I think that that's that fair I think it's pretty fair um for especially a small bus um because I'm assuming the be somewhere in there what were we saying poo poo platter um profit yes so making making the deal structure um I would try and separate the business out into what what the components are right so it's like you have the routes that they do for you know poop poop
(01:43) pickups or whatever right so you have you've got the customer list then you've got the the people who do the poop scooping um and then you probably have some sort of administrative stuff I don't know if they if sales are marketing I'm guessing you're pretty good at sales and marketing so you don't need their sales and marketing you're trying to buy the book of business yeah so um it's just I think it's you'll probably just end up having an sop for each of the core components and there's a really good book um for you no one
(02:09) else needs to read this uh it's called Uh how to make a few billion dollars um the guy just did three rollups over his whole career and each rollup he sold for like 10 billion um and so it's really just understanding that all the business have components and you basically just have a massive checklist that you do when you integrate a business it's like that's literally it it's just the world's longest checklist and every single integration you do you get a little bit better and you add things to the checklist until eventually like you've covered every single thing and you can go faster and faster and if have
(02:41) you studied Waste Management yeah yeah I mean because literally I mean yeah you should uh I mean that was literally how they grow so finding routes I mean I would study everything about that business um but it's really just breaking down the components and having Sops that are associate with them uh do you need to Rebrand the businesses you buy under the same brand to make it more attract acve to investors do that not really matter as much um I would probably Rebrand it if you really want to do the big play you'll get a premium for it yeah thank you yeah you bet hi hello so my question is
(03:14) regarding emails email marketing and the thing is that we currently have a quite good leak magnet okay which is free and which is good but the problem is that as soon as they opt in and start to get emails from us it's only that can about an open rate from 20 to 25% something how can I push that up um so two things one is how good the lead magnet is so I know to People Want it but the question is how good is it once they get it fundamentally the value deliver always reinforces them consuming more value and so like you grow an audience by delivering more to them than
(03:51) it costs them to consume it and so they make a good trade on their time compared to other trades on their time from other people they could be consuming information from I mean fundamentally that's how I built my brand right and so if you think about the lead mag as a microcosm of that then that's that the other obvious one is just that you need to split test uh subject heads are you split testing subject heads on a regular basis for the email flop I'm not exactly sure because I'm not in charge for the email marketing
(04:16) I'll bet you you're not so yeah I mean it's just it's so like a lot of this stuff just for for everyone is like I I get asked sometimes a lot of questions that can be that can be solved with a test and not like I can tell you the answer and so when we want to figure out pricing we test pricing you guys saw a up yesterday from it right so like we test pricing um and that's how we that's how we do things like we just try it out and we see and so we do the same thing we just like see if this headline works better and then we see like we run tests constantly and I would say that's probably one of the things
(04:52) that has worked really well for us and what I would warn you against is like you're on the like if there's a pendulum of testing right there's like we test everything all the time and there's like we haven't tested things what's a test um like there's kind of a sweet spot because whenever you do test there's a cost of testing which is guaranteed you have a cost of change like you have mess ups that happen right um and so those are guaranteed but the upside of the test isn't guaranteed and so you want to make sure that the tests that you're doing are worth it and so for you the
(05:24) cost of the test doing a split you know split test on a subject ad is probably not that much if you want to test a change in your offer it costs more you got to retrain the team you got to retrain the Fulfillment there's more things that have to happen so there's kind of like low cost tests and high cost tests and not all high cost tests are going to have high output and sometimes low cost tests have massive output and so you want to kind of order these from like okay what is the lowest likelihood test that could have the most
(05:49) output and you just literally order them you're like all right well let's grab one off of here and we do them in that orderes that make sense yeah so we literally have a big list it's like Alex ideas where do I find for my stuff right and so we so I because so this is to your add question that you had earlier like I highly recommend doing this it took me a long time to learn for like for Lea and I to figure out this Dynamic was that I had about one new idea for our business per day and Lea's like we can do like one a quarter and so I was like what do
(06:21) I do with all these extras and so I would just bottle them up and just go nuts right so instead I did two things one is that I started making content to get ideas out get my creative juices out so it's kind of an outlet so you guys are like the product of a creative outlet for me and the other thing is having my big list of ideas and it's literally called Alex's big list of ideas and I just have this Mass because you're lose it so you write it down and then next week like you know actually wasn't that good of an idea but I was about to change the whole company and now I I I actually think it's F right
(06:53) and so um by having that list it kind of gives you a little bit of space between them because you're always emotionally invested in it when it's your idea it's fresh and so giving it some time to to settle it allows me to look at these and be like no even with like a month of sleep this is a good idea we should test this one and it's worth the worth the cost and so that's how I that's how I get some of that Creative Juice out and I make sure that the test we have the highest return so in regards to email
(07:18) marketing you just think of a nice fancy title and then you just write it down and sleep some dayses about so um honestly like the first thing I would do is just Google like split test headlines for subjects okay yeah and then you'd have probably you could probably find like 500 and be like okay which of these apply to my Niche all right perfect thank you that box yes sir hey man yes hello I have a SAS company it's an e-commerce fulfillment platform that specializes in Drop Shipping fulfillment cool we have super super high churn 33% because a month a month yeah because 99%
(07:54) of our traffic is a new business that they're trying to start an e-commerce business we've done surveying market research like I'm going to make your day but keep going okay the the their their issue is they need to find which products they want to sell and drive profitable traffic which just can't figure out how to operationalize that yeah so you have something called structural turn um which is something to not lose sleepover okay thank you like Shopify has more turn than you do yeah so it's just it's the nature of getting into the vsnb space so vsnb is very small business owner SB and know
(08:24) mid-market then you go up to Enterprise um but you're just you're in the vsnb space which is almost the same as consumer just the game yeah but the good news is there's a gazillion of them and so that's the trade it's an infinite Market almost yeah yeah and so like if you think about what shopify's business model is it's like I mean it's in your space right is that they have a very small fee for people to start and then they get their upside from payments for the people who self self- select as the
(08:48) you know highest and best users and so they make money on people who make no money and then once those people make a lot of money they make more money with them and so it's kind of like a dual-sided uh monetization structure and so that might be something that I would explore yeah we're looking into payments but I'm trying to figure like I thought that was the constraint my business but churn yeah um it's I mean 3% a month for vmb is not bad 33% oh 33 yeah yeah that's that's worse than three yeah um super high it's 11 times worse than three um I
(09:20) was like dude you're doing fine I love I was like I'm make your day I love three doing great um yeah got it yeah so I I'll bet you can get that probably closer down to 10 yeah um I would look at with shop I think they're like at 10 but like it's it's high yeah um and so everything so my recommendation because obviously we have school and so I'm I'm in the vsnb world um is you want to think about improving the product through elimination rather than addition so it's how can I eliminate things from the product that people aren't using
(09:50) what are the thing like the number one reason people cancel is overwhelming you get distracted overwhelmed there too many things they don't know what to do and so it's really trying to pull this this goes for service too by the way um trying to pull as many things out and like you can introduce things later that they don't necessarily need yet so it's really just thinking what is the one thing I need them to do right now and then until they do that I'm not going to show them something else and then once
(10:12) they have done that I will show them the next thing to do it's just trying to keep as little friction assumingly possible and that like the 100 golden BBS it's no there's no Silver Bullet it's it's just looking at right now like you probably have a DAT a guy hopefully on the team that can run like a regression analysis on on the cohorts yeah and so if you do you know what your activation points are yeah we know the golden path okay yeah well then just I mean literally all resources go towards that thing like if that is the constraint of the business then I don't care about getting new members I don't I
(10:42) mean like I care about them in so far as we need to test the cohort out to make sure that it's working but I'm not doing any growth initiatives I'm not doing any new features everything that we're focused on is how do we get more people to that activation point and I don't care about anything else that's it and so if the activation point is right then will go down if the activation point that you have is wrong then you have to find what it really is yeah good day Alex how you doing hello hello my name is Josh I own a business in Australia and we help universities Australia
(11:12) Australia and we help universities or Unis in Australia keep their students and keep them happy so they don't drop out so your college video was really applicable to us I think the Australian government was listening to you because they introduced a policy this year I know I came to tell that new in person I know uh they introduced policy where Australian Unis to receive funding have to dramatically increase the amount of low socioeconomic students the one that benefits most from uni which is cool and then they released a policy that said four essentially $60 million of student
(11:43) funding has to go to clubs societies fraternities to support those students so eight years ago I started a business on the premise that uni should really invest in supporting students because it keeps their customers there and that's good for UNIS and good for students so I have a woman in a $60 million red dress okay and my question is normally I'm selling to a student engagement professional it's their first professional job now I'm selling to their boss's boss okay so I have a a value equation basically for student retention that we've created this instrument which shows them why students
(12:16) drop out where their Dropout rates are benchmarks it exactly what to do sounds good and then our training Solutions are the answer to that right but I've spent eight years selling training Solutions not data and Analysis I'm not used to selling to the CEO I'm used to selling to their employees say again they just want the data they just want the data the higher up you go just for everybody for Enterprise sales the the more money the person makes the more they don't care about the narrative yeah that's
(12:42) just been my experience now of course stories sell and there's like sure you want to have a you know a meta narrative if you want but like until you show them the math behind it which is like what is your return on this and that's what they want so my problem was my churn I'd lose maybe 20% per year the ones who'd hire me for training the students go it's the best training been to it's amazing but they wouldn't be able to tell their boss or their boss's boss the data to prove that it was good for retention well you have to track the data you have to track
(13:07) it yeah but they would never give me that data so I couldn't ultimately prove you have to make a contingent like you have to do it you have to do it you have to do it right in order to work with us like we have a proprietary technology and it feeds off of data and in order for us to make your product or solution better we have to get this data so we can Implement in real time and so right now we're start with the vanilla version yeah but in two years this is going to be the Super tailored version to your University so we know that you know all universities benefit from these five
(13:31) things but there's usually five to 10 other things that are we will learn from this data so you have to do it so these are the three things that we'll do to make it easier for you to actually get this data back to us so we can help you make more money yeah can I ask you one quick followup on that the tool that we do that now is a $30,000 product per year on subscription that uh universities have started to buy before that our LTV of training was $34,000 okay so the tool that justifies the $34,000 training is worth $30,000 sure so that's what I'm wondering do I
(14:02) focus more on selling that and then sell s for 60 if you want and just say it comes with these two things it comes with the training sure and pivot towards that yeah I mean fundamentally like those are components I don't even see them as that important like the only thing that matters to them is the likelihood that they get their customers to stay and pay longer and renew year after year after year Y and so how we get there matters just really little and you know this from the sales side I think you're just into weeds right now because you're you know you have your entrepreneur head on and you're here but
(14:32) like yeah if you're a customer I don't care if we're going to be doing keto or cutting my calories like I just want to be able to fit in my high school jeans yeah so just tell me how there that's it cool man appreciate you he bet I a brick and mortar franchise owner um I own five indoor golf simulator locations across the country cool I've got um fdds in place to scale out to 12 are you franchise or or franchise franchisees okay got it so so um one of the constraints that I experience every year is um was predominantly a seasonal
(15:06) business so when they started in the Midwest and when it's cold and people can't get out to the golf courses they come indoors and play but the constraint is in the summer time my utilization just drops right off the table and I'm trying to push forward based on some some information I got from customers about what they really like about the place it's like you know time in time to play a game is much shorter indoors the weather's always consistent a lot of things like that and I'm trying to push my branding in that direction so I can
(15:37) address some of that low utilization in the offseason do you have any ideas that you could offer on that yeah I mean obviously I'm here in Vegas and I'd be like want to do 18 in under 30 minutes and it be air conditioned with a drink in hand like I I mean you could sell me right yeah I just like air conditioning in general but um but yeah I mean I think I think that's the because I was thinking was like all right because a lot like long care guys have the same issue right it's like when it's the winter for them it's the opposite issues like so then they have to get into snowplowing they call it the on season
(16:07) and offseason Terrible by the way if you're in a seasonal business don't call it the offseason because then everyone's gonna treat it like the offseason um you just lose money the whole time um but I think that I think that that perspective um makes sense like the the benefits of indoor now I would bet that the places where it's hottest in the summer um might benefit the most from that it's like get out of the summer heat and like because you have a time component and you have a comfort component which I actually think are pretty strong um and so I would just be leading with those because everyone
(16:38) faster and everyone wants things to be easier and so you do both so just focus my branding and and sales in that direction yeah thank you sir yeah and I was instead of branding I just say this the messaging yeah just from a delineation yeah um I'm Millie I run a math tutoring company with my partner Christian a what a what training company math tutoring math tutoring math very sexy um so right now we're really really small our offer is good our sales process is good we know that we just need to do more of it which is fine um
(17:08) and we're hiring people to help us with the sales and the Fulfillment what I want to know is you've built a brand where all of your employees seem to have that same let's get done attitude as you do how do you instill that within your team so that they know like let's get this done you get rid of people who don't have that okay and then the only people who are left are people who are that and then when you bring someone else who's new and they're like I don't think they have it you're like I think you're right we let them go simple yeah it's the hard thing it's
(17:40) like that girl that's back home that you know that isn't that good you need to let her go and then you have to do more interviews and then pick somebody and probably be wrong and do it again until eventually build the culture based on those values and you just want to get through that as fast as you can because fundamentally if you're scaling service you're scaling culture and training if you're SC scaling a service business yeah so it's going to be those values and how how good you are at giving someone base skills and so if you think about um really in any kind of role how
(18:11) vague you can be with your directives is directly proportional to how skilled someone is in a given domain and so if you have people that you're like I literally have to tell her to turn on the computer then this person has such low based skills I think that you can teach anyone anything I do fundamentally believe that the question is just as a business owner is it worth it and so it's like I do think I could change you from being inconsistent to consistent it's just how long will that take me and are there other people who I can get better Returns on my time with and so fundamentally just think about it like that is how much training will I have to
(18:40) introduce to this person now if you have a service business that's a small as a brick and mortar uh no it's online well regardless you your business is going to be also like the training components that like you you have culture anding the culture is what you choose to tolerate internally but the training is going be how good like you're good at teaching math you have to think about how good you are at teaching people to teach math and teaching people to do every other skill that's associated with teaching
(19:02) math because I'll bet you there's plenty of people who are decent at math who suck at teaching math and even worse at talking to people yes right so sometimes you might have to like do a little bit of Dale Carnegie which is like okay so when someone walks in you greet them with a smile here's how you greet people I'm dead serious like this is like there's a reason Chick-fil-A if you're here in the states is what it is it's like they teach people how to people yeah awesome thank you bet that's going to be the differentiator that's what's going to take you to the next
(19:27) level uh I want to Medical Spa with my wife yeah and uh so love Med Spas we offer a ton of services anti-aging Services the most popular ones are the least profitable ones um so trying to determine strategy should we Market the ones that are most popular try to get people in more and then look to upsell because the higher margin ones I mean you're talking like a 10 to 15x difference in Revenue so I'm just trying to determine do we Market more General come on in we'll give you a year plan or just Market the Baseline one come in and
(20:06) then just try to upsell after that this is a great question and it probably affects a lot of people here it is a math question so you can solve this and actually know what the right answer is and so I'll just give you an example so let's say um Botox is what people come in for for example all right so what how much botox cost what's your gross profit on Botox uh so after we factor in all of our Mak cost like $58 per Tre okay so you make 58 bucks okay per Botox so what does it cost to get somebody in the door uh right now
(20:37) our CAC is 202 okay so 202 great now what percentage of these people can you sell into ice you know the cool sculpting or whatever else uh we're about like 40% okay so 40% of those people and what's the average ticket of the thing they buy or gross profit of the thing they buy afterwards uh like $1,300 okay so whatever this is that's uh 400 520 so 520 plus 58 so it's this times this right is 578 okay so this is path one now if you mark it straight for this thing what's C uh just overall I don't know ual per surface line over okay so if you
(21:32) basically so to answer the question you just promote this up front see what CAC is and so here if you've got 202 to uh 578 you you're like just under 3 to one right and so you're you're feeling it right now I'm guessing you're like I just need this to be bigger right and so um I think this upsell efficiency is pretty good to be honest with you um now this you might be able to work on because is I would bet that this can get expanded to like 5 or 6,000 and then that would probably make all the difference in the world and so in terms
(22:04) of Med Spa that I that we like because we i l lik MedSpa stuff and so I was like all right let's just buy a chain and then you can get stuff for free to save me money anyways so um uh but I I think I think this is actually probably where the deficiency is I actually don't know if it's like 200 bucks is fine um especially like that's what it cost to get somebody for a gym membership and like you know right like and that's a way lower LTV than this so This actually feels like the this actually feels like the problem to me is that and the conversion is okay I think you might just need to see if you can sell bigger bundles and you might
(22:40) want to consider do you have financing yes so you have third party third party or in-house third party huh okay then you might I think you just need to I think the I think you probably need to so you probably have a sales process you in terms of how you're offering the main thing and so I would consider wait till the next book comes out you're going to love it um uh doing something called like a menu close and so you sell the vacation and say like okay if you were to look like a goddess these are all the
(23:06) things you need and then everything they cross off they just look uglier and older and so they're like it's like okay just look a little bit ugli a little older we can cross that off though no worries right hahaa okay and so and so you can start there though and it's just like okay because I'd rather start at ideal and then just try and figure out a way to make it work with their budget than try and just get a sale if that makes sense so I'm going to bet that this is the problem if you want you could try and Market this directly and then then you'd have I guess 100% of people that would go into this because like if you go to acquire customers
(23:37) let's say let's say you you cire these people for $300 then it would make more sense to Market that as the front end my guess though is that you just need to boost this guy because this is fine okay thank yeah you bet I mean I've heard of some men spots paying 200 bucks a lead so so using your delivery Cube as an example in LTV the T ratio when you're thinking about uh modifying components of your offer that are maybe fairely fulfillment intensive uh where you have maybe a unicorn or keyman risk how are you uh
(24:09) massaging that how are you thinking about this problem knowing that okay I can't have the unir keyman risk I want to increase LTV for my customers but my customers really like this thing so I think like oneone support gym launch you have to so whenever you get into keyman risk in general just for everybody you it's what makes things rare is combinations what makes them commoditized is breaking into chunks and so if someone's an exceptional painter it's because they can combine color and movement and whatever you know like I don't know painting but
(24:44) I'm sure there's other components of painting and so and so within the support component there's probably three or four things that this person does very well and so you just chunk it down right it's kind of like the example I gave yesterday is like how do you replace Alex in this business for delivery like I was keyman well I wasn't going to expect somebody to be better at being Alex than me so I was like but I can find somebody who's really good at phone sales who's really good at phone sales and they're just as good as I am now they're not going to be also as good at retention and strategy and ads but
(25:12) they can be just as good at that and then I find somebody else who's really good at ads I'm like he's just as good as me at ads he's just not good at all the other stuff and so fundamentally like when you scale in a company that is how you replace keyman risk it's chopping the unicorns hornof and saying okay I can find a rhinoceros and you're like okay now I just need a horse and I need some you know fireflies to get the glitter and there we go it took three people to you know replace my unicorn with things that are more readily available and so you just chunk down
(25:37) what the skills that this one person has into component parts and then you can teach those component parts much more easily so it takes the mysticism out of it does that make sense yeah I was thinking in terms of the so let's say you have like Zoom Community Learning Management System and the community is becoming the Intensive part I'm not doing the Fulfillment of a director of Education who still could out the UN but we need to eventually for scalability purposes one thing I talked about Neil is maybe moving people on
(26:04) like more of a we already do zooms but doing more zooms instead of one to one Community interaction or something this so more Su you need to change the offer from 101 to semi-private it is semi-private already but there tends to be a time intensive concurent of like reviewing specific case studies that that Mak sense so either so here's okay so I'm gonna I will tell you a story to answer hopefully answer your question so I had so my first ever gym model um I tweaked a couple times and then I got it right
(26:35) and I had this setup where people would do six weeks of weight loss and kind of like more high-intensity training there's a point to this and six weeks of like weights to tone so it's like burn and tone I this is commercialized for Mass market for those of you who are in the fitness space just breathe all right and so what ended up happening is that my sessions got so full that I was like shoot I should change how I'm doing delivery because I can't fit any more people in my gym which was the wrong solution I had found something that
(27:06) everyone actually liked and so what I should have done was just more of that and so you're in a situation where you're like how do I scale delivery more I don't think you're delivery is unscalable you just need more people to do that thing that people like and so either do you have margin to support it I could probably swing that in terms of just reallocating some of our expens well if the answer is not really then it's a you're mispriced not necessarily need to change what you're like so basically either I can either charge
(27:37) more to increase LTV and continue the service or adjust the service yes I will say it's harder to find something that everyone really likes then it is to just change the price so if you have something that everyone really loves then you probably can support a price change and so I want to make sure you're solving the right problem like sure you can go from semi-private to group but that might lose all of the value and then if you charge the same thing now you have your price to value discrepencies out of whack so what I did
(28:09) this was the mistake is I took my sessions and I shortened them so I could fit more sessions in and by doing that I destroyed the thing that worked so don't do that product Market fit is much harder to find than pricing next one that hopefully applied to somebody else here so you've G over a lot of your successes and failures what was that and failures go ahead yeah and and so my question is more about your kind of protecting your mental health and your ability with these extreme emotions because I've gone through both exits and acquisition the last two years yeah and I've just never been more
(28:47) miserable main reason I'm here okay is just either getting resources or connections I'm just wondering how you've handled when you had those major losses when you've lost everything or when you've kind of had that failures face you in the face and also if you ever view an acquisition as a loss of community sure how do you protect yourself so I will not spend a long time on this um because it gets into a very he chunked up version of reality which is just like I believe that when I die within 6 months no one will give a and so the fact that no one will care 6
(29:25) months after I'm dead for the most significant life event that I have which is that I am no longer alive it makes a lot of the other stuff not matter that much and so I also know that when I was poor and I had nothing I was about as happy as I am now and so if I was just as happy then as I am now then I could go all the way back there and basically being in the same thing and I think in some ways when I really play it out I get just as excited about the idea of having the comeback story now I'm going to try to not do that but if I did it I
(29:55) would get into the state that I think that I'd be like this is going to be my thing and so like a lot of times the fears we have are catastrophized and so I like I want to have this like of the many list of books I have this big document of like Alex's list of books that he will someday write um but one of them is play it out and so a thing that I say a lot on quarterly and strategics is like let's play it out like what happens next what happens next what happens next and so like what actually happens next is not that bad it's just
(30:25) the idea of it that seems very bad I mean has this quote that's the fear is a mile wide an inch deep it's like you take a step onto it and you're like oh this isn't that big of a deal like the worst case is I moved back with my well actually you know I kind of like my parents and you know homecook meal is not so bad you know I'm only going to see them for 10 more years before they're just old as anyways so you know it could be a blessing in disguise and like there's a lot of research that's been done on like people who become paralyzed and within like 3 to 6 months they return to the exact same
(30:55) Baseline of subjective well-being as they were when they had all their Limbs and so as much as that's a terrible thing that could occur losing money is probably a lot less bad than losing Limbs and if it happened to them and they're just about as happy now as they were 6 months earlier I just genuine like Leela and I are sit on opposite polls like I struggle to care she cares so much and that's how we Yin and yangang in business is that she'll get stressed and I'll be like we can die no one will care and like when you zoom out you're
(31:27) like oh there's the world and like I'm a monkey on a little thing again this is a worldview thing some people don't agree with this and I had I've had people get really upset about it so that's how I deal with it and so for me I just don't have really big Stakes because I just don't think anyone cares that's all like the idea that everyone is watching just isn't I run Dental CL and our USB is single visit full mouth weh have okay so like veneers and all that yeah got it cool but it's a single transaction and that my LTV is over so I don't have redention okay I
(32:02) understood what I have to do since yesterday and the r table this morning but I have to understand from you if you can advise me on do I have to do a big upell after no no so think about it this way so um one of the first jobs I had was at a fur coat dealer and so you're selling fur coats so once now mind you he can sell more than one coat you can't sell more than one mouth but um you probably can't every 10 years but let's not get into that so um what he realized because he was fourth generation so they had to like figure out the business model over you know more than a hundred years was that he invented summer
(32:38) storage and so the idea was okay how do we get these people who bought these $5,000 jackets to like come back because you know big $5,000 coat for the average consumer that was buying it it's actually an aspirational purchase so a lot of people think luxury is only for rich people but 90% of buyers are actually poor people who want to look rich fun fact um and so what they found out was well if we get people to come back regularly for other stuff they're more likely to buy more frequently right and so what you need is insurance so when you when someone buys something very expensive what you do is you charge
(33:10) 5 to 10% of the total purchase price for insurance now I say insurance with quotes here but like it's hey you spent 20 grand on your mouth spend a th000 bucks a year to keep it right keep yeah to keep it looking nice because I can double how long these teeth are going to last if you go into our maintenance program and then you have this long-term care literally probably be called long-term care um for your mouth and then that way you can extend the ROI on the investment that you made do you think it's better if I do it after the the single sale or
(33:42) between the after after so sell the 20 then they have the mirror in front of them and they're like oh my God and you're like right you don't want this to go away because this could go away and only for 5% of the thing you just like, bucks a year will keep it looking nice and they just spent 20 they're not going to give a it's like whatever thank you very much first thanks for everything you man we in the position where we have a couple offers on the table to exit a couple of Lois um it's lifechanging money but we
(34:11) believe if we stuck around for two to three more years it could be like extra lifechanging money sure so how would you look at this decision and decide when's the right time to one of the hardest decisions in business it's a very personal question and it comes down and the nice thing is that you have have you have all of the information to make the decision so on one hand you have your personal goals which is like this is the amount of money that I said I would be willing to part you know part ways with this this is what I started whatever um on the other hand you also understand
(34:43) how reliable your businesses if you feel like the business has a good leadership team in place you have plenty of room to expand in the market the infrastructure is you know secure the revenue that you keep you have high Revenue do you have what's your Revenue retention annually so our uh revenue is about 6.
(35:08) 1 this year and our evida is around 2 three what's Revenue retention what percentage of that Revenue came from the year before it's all for one time sales so we don't have re Curr or one of the things we add yeah so you're in you're in like the devil's gamid right now um and so like you're getting an offer uh which is great on something that could also be gone tomorrow with an ad account shut down or whatever right I don't know how you get customers but I'm just assuming is it ads okay and so like there so it this is a purely risk this is a risk assessment is if you were like for sure
(35:47) we're going to be able to grow then don't sell if you're like I don't know if we're going to be able if we're going to grow from here then sell and so like only you can know that and I'd say the second like question one b and this is a really big one that I think is underrated is what are you going to do after and so I have friends who've exited and there's basically like two camps there's exit and don't have a plan and exit and know exactly what you're going to do and these guys huge massive crisis of
(36:19) meaning these guys they just get right back to work and um having looked at both of those like the day after I sold gym launch I started acquisition and that like literally the next day um and I'm very happy that I did that um I think having a lot of time and a lot of money and nothing to do bad combo for entrepreneurs personal personal opinion so if you are going to sell have a very clear idea what you're going to do next then no that's I mean this is real this is like a real life decision and so um I don't know what the what the life-changing money that they're offering is if someone's offering you
(36:57) know 10 times botom line for something that has onetime transactions and it's all cash like terms of the deal matter it's all cash you can walk away then yeah maybe not a bad deal if it's you know seller finance you consult back for you know a year or two years um and they're buying you know 51% um but you're expected to work for the next however many years then you basically have a job either way in which case you're like th okay this is the frame you can think of how will my daily Behavior change if what you do every day doesn't change then why sell it which is why for me the
(37:33) terms of my sale were like I will stop working the day I get this check and if you can't do that then I will not sign the deal yeah ours is like we're we're out out uh once we sign okay's options of majority of the money up front a little bit of seller financing a little bit than now we're out well yeah so I mean this is a purely personal decision I won't take too much more time on it but like it's a risk decision which risk is purely personal it's like do you want to put it all on bitcoin you could it's just purely personal can you just tell us to sell [Laughter]
(38:16) it you know sometimes it's like you flip the coin and then you uh when it's in the air you decide what you want to do I think it's a terrible way to make decisions but it works for some people um but no I I deliberate about this actually on my YouTube channel I have a 46 minute video that has like seven views on it because it's the entire decision- making process around why I sold and it's like two years ago maybe three years ago it's a really long video like we watch that and that's how we backed out of our first
(38:46) off well good I'm glad it it served you but now I mean now you got a much better offer so it just comes down to how risky is it that because the thing is is businesses and this is one you can write down businesses will always go up in value until the day they don't and then they're worth nothing so a business that grows will always be worth more even a business that maintains is worth more the track record they've been consistent but the day the business goes down no one touches it so that's the that's the knife's edge
(39:17) longer you keep it the more valuable it is my name's Rick I'm owner looking to scale my La sure and I've identifi value today identifi to constraints one is the marketing is all outside agencies and I don't really know a lot about it so I want to bring that in and also I think I need to start hiring higher level talent to start basically unicorn parts of what I do y and we are I guess another con would be we are a cash flow intense is um contrain yeah so at what point I guess do you put it all together what do you think is the better route to go if you have to do one or the other is it the one that attorney
(40:02) train attorne I think both are six-month Endeavors if I'm just guessing recruit and train top talent or build an in-house marketing team one brings it in one money if I one the other first so um I would because you have a small team you have six people right six or seven people right so um I think that the best from what I see the law firms that make the most money are exceptional promoters especially in the transactional space which you're in um and so I would hire an exceptional agency that has a proven
(40:40) track record and I would study everything they do have you read the agency's chapter in leads book I read that chapter so it literally does like this is how I do this is how I learn marketing so I go to agencies and I say hey um and I like agencies uh most times more than the coaching world because agencies have to produce result or they get fired um and so I go to agencies ideally ones that have I get from referrals and then I tell them I want to steal everything that you have but I will do it over a longer period of time
(41:09) because it'll take me time to learn and I will compensate you for the difference so your normal people probably turn out at you know month three or four it'll probably take me longer than that so you'll pay more I'll pay more there and then after I do kind of absorb what you're doing um I'll pay you a Consulting period after that to make sure I can troubles so you'll make more LTV than than a normal customer but I'll do that in exchange that I want you to show me what you're doing this is how I've learned every platform I just pay someone more okay because the agency I have
(41:39) right now is there's no transparency they money and they give right and that's why at the onset read the chapter I literally have a script in there what you say to the person uh and if they say no then you go to another agency and you read the script again okay that's what I do the answer is agency if I were in your position and I had six employees I would rather learn it because in order for you to succeed at the level I think you want to succeed at you've got to know the stuff hey so first I just want to say thank
(42:07) you you're welcome my last business was an early childhood education shared services startup I built it from concept to fully funded $32 million awesome and then scaled from just to 133 staff people in 18 months awesome so thank you and I left it because I made a community decision to incubate it at another nonprofit but I was not the owner okay so I built it for them weird now I help career women I made them a shitload of money it made them a so happy so now I help career women prod themselves so that they can become sols or ear startup Founders Co my
(42:53) question here is around your Calculus for Speed because for me I had nine months to take very disal stakeholders pull them together make concept 18 mons of diligence now I building a do like the person so my around speed exactly you shared earlier the temperature that entrepreneurs are comfortable with has been hard for me to calibrate especially because we do you feel like you're going too fast or too slow I think I'm going too slow and my brain you know what's weird is that I I have I have yet to meet an entrepreneur who says that they're going too slow you're the only
(43:33) one every other entrepreneur is like I'm going way too fast um things are just happening so fast around me um I'm joking um no entrepreneur says that everyone's like this should have been done seven years ago like why is this taking so long like I can do this in 5 seconds why does it take you five years um so so I think first off it's normal um but let's chunk down a level what specifically do you feel like is not happening fast enough so think about it from inputs and outputs outputs I don't care about outputs outputs occur Revenue
(44:05) occurs profit occurs as a result of inputs and so what inputs are not happening fast enough so to me it's the equation of cash flow and closing my learning Gap so for example I have been like oh I am the sales and and all these things which have required me to close my learning Gap I would prefer to hire someone to like build out the sales team but you don't have cash flow yet yeah so when you start so this okay so was was the other thing funded that you did yes okay so this is really cool for everybody this is a great meta concept
(44:38) so every single business on planet Earth incurs debt from the day it starts it's just that the nature of the debt is different so if you're bootstrap you start with leadership debt management debt technical debt you incur all these different types of debt if you're venture-backed for example you incur financial debt but you you can spend the money to get the CRM day one you can spend the money to get the executive team day one and so you incur less financial debt less technical debt less of all these things but then you got to pay back the financial debt or you just
(45:08) slice down the pi so you have a much smaller slice and so um whenever you trade like you have there's there's trade-offs between the types of debt that you choose to incur and so bootstrap businesses in general take longer to grow because you have the issue that you have right now just that you have to keep stockpiling and you usually have to work double time because you have to do today's job and tomorrow's job in order to generate basically you do two or three jobs to generate the cash flow from the savings of not paying someone else to do that job to be able to afford to pay the
(45:39) person to do the job that then levels you up to the next job that you can take over that pays even better and so that's fundamentally the cycle of a bootstrapped entrepreneur and so I don't think that you're going too slow it feels slow because you were used to jetpacks that were artificial no just being real like if you're like I've got 10 million bucks let's go it's a very different starting block right like businesses that I can grow now I'll just I can just fund them to start and that's where you get real leverage because you get the best of both because then you
(46:09) have the capital you can start like your Venture backed but you're the venture-backed company and so you can start with all the leadership in place get all the consultants in so that you can get the Tex you know Tech stack and all that stuff and you can pay for the Enterprise savings for a year ahead of time and you can do all that stuff and not dilute down but then the company owes me money but I own the company so whatever right and I know I'm going to get a good returnal capital and so fundamentally does that help everybody in terms of thinking about this from a
(46:34) speed perspective like venture-backed companies go faster because they cheat from like the nature of business is like they start with a ton of money and they can spend it for money they didn't make bootstrap you have to make every dollar that you spend but I think that long-term bootstrap businesses are the most fundamentally sound um I won't even get too much into that cuz I'll just stop there all tldr is you're going slow because you comparing it to a venture back company I will say that was a public
(47:06) private partnership that was grunding so we also didn't have the pressure of like we had social outcomes too yeah you didn't even have like you didn't even have like revenue or profit goals you had even hit so you had like outside money you didn't you weren't accountable for any Financial metrics and you could just hire people like yeah that's like literally the opposite of a bootstrap business and so like it's unsurprising that it feels different next H will be someone in the content space and then sales how much in
(47:40) cash reserves do you think I should have before I bring on somebody who's make so this will be good for everybody the rate at which you hire is actually a risk question kind of like we were talking about earlier and so this is where I made a tweet the other day was like your lifestyle is your competitor's opportunity which is the amount that you require to live on in distributions is what you can't reinvest in the business but there's no perfect answer for that if you have a family with kids like we were talking about earlier then I don't see that as bad it's just that if somebody else you're
(48:16) competing against doesn't have a family and kids and reinvests all that money then they're going to beat you but you might not care CU you might not be in a business where there's a network effect that like it's a Ras to the top very few businesses are that way like if you're trying to build Facebook then yeah you probably want to reinvest everything if you're trying to build a dry cleaning store probably doesn't matter and So within the context of your business I doubt that there are network effects that are going to like kick in at any time reasonable and if you did you need
(48:38) Venture backing to get there in time anyway so let's just not get into that um and so the time that you choose to hire that person is basically based on the risk that you're comfortable with dealing knowing like if you know that the business is going to continue to grow then you're just you're just dragging the growth forward but you're sacrificing your paycheck so you can pay somebody else so they can drag that growth forward and so it's a like the entrepreneurs dilemma is consumption verse investment as when do I start getting payday and it really
(49:09) just depends on you all right so we're we're kind of new in that process and I'm trying to trust the process based off a lot of your content videos to try to make it short I feel like I'm I'm at a casino three black tables first agency sucked I go the next dealer they sucked I go to the next dealer but I have faith um so we're a company that that's driven most of our business most Blind Faith yeah most of our most of our business based off of uh just organic networking in person cool um just trying to figure out like a formula or how to determine a budget what do you sell ads what do you sell uh Roofing and
(49:49) windows okay got it helpful um yeah I mean you most guys who succeeded that are either doing outbound one they have referral Partners so they have other businesses that are tangential to Windows and Roofing that go into customers homes this is other Home Services businesses and they set up good Kickbacks for those sales reps and those people at those businesses or it's usually PPC driven or or social driven so those are kind of like the four most common besides word of mouth right um that people Ed to grow those businesses because we have home services that come through all the time so very familiar with the the model um
(50:28) so the issue that you're having just so I'm can restate the problem is that you've tried three agencies and they have not produced results so when you say they haven't produced results did they not produce leads or the leads sucked uh both difference both uh yeah okay now so of the ones that produce leads what was the problem with the leads not relevant said that uh they they didn't fill out the forms or they they don't know why we contracted them some oh a home uhhuh okay a home yeah so um the the crappy part with the agency
(51:07) Gambit especially if you don't know what you're doing is that like you end up getting burned but it's one of those things where like you're not going to quit right and so it's kind of like agencies didn't work for us it's like well there's obviously agencies that are in home services that do great and so um like path one is you just keep find you keep going until you find an agency and when you talk to them you're like hey if I don't see results in 30 days I'm out but if I do I'll keep paying you for a very long time and also ask them for their best practices because if an
(51:35) agency does not give you best practices they suck so just give you as a warning so the best agencies will be like okay this is the funnel that the leads are coming in on this is the offer they're seeing the people who see the most success call leads within 5 minutes this is the script they use this is how they maximiz show UPS blah blah blah blah blah so they're going to give you their kind of like best system and some of them will also just work the leads for you because business owners in general suck at working leads and so like if
(52:02) you're not getting an agency that's even talking that lingo then I would say that that would be a that would be a red flag so just use that as like at least filter number one um but in terms of like how I would probably approach that business it would be going to tangential so it's like carpet cleaning and Landscaping and other Home Services where people are in those on a regular basis and they see the you know they see the the roof and the windows on a regular it's like hey I'll give you a thousand bucks or whatever you know whatever your referral
(52:31) fee could be and so what's your cost you require customer right now that's another constraint our numbers okay well how much do you make from a customer on average uh 8,000 Okay cool so you could pay a grand for a customer and be happy with it is that margin 8,000 or Revenue okay great yeah so then yeah if you give landscapers a th000 bucks a referr referral they will beg borrow and steal to get you referrals and so obviously that's a very different strategy for acquisition if I were in your shoes fastest easiest path is look for an agency that follows those check marks and I don't know how your buying
(53:12) process went but I would recommend also reading the agency chapter in case you read it um but like talk to 10 of them before you buy like actually talk to 10 sounds crazy I think that's been a problem is just dating two people and choosing one yeah yeah like date more than one it's like I got a crazy chick and a fat chick you're like ah you know you know so like whatever so like just you know like open the pool of who you can pick from right so that's that's kind of where I would where I would go with that does that make sense so just
(53:46) open the selection up and then I will promise you this by the time this is when you know you can pick so I'll give you the limus test is when you stop learning things on the call so you talk to the first guy and you're like okay that's a lot of new information thanks for that we'll be back to you talk to the second guy he mentions more new stuff for me it takes me about 15 calls with experts to really wrap my head around a space and so that's like kind of like my litmus test so once I start like being able to say like but what about this and what about this consideration and they're like oh he's a more knowledgeable consumer and
(54:16) like I can start talking their lingo um that's how I know I can make an informed decision so you've been making uninformed decisions and because of that been getting bad results which is not surprising I me no insult to the the women in the room just just a hypothetical in a business like mine I feel like I've watched your content and I've tried to implement on the things but I feel like it's hard to put it into the things you say because it's a little bit different I do a business loans and it's very cash heavy up front um and right now I've realized that constraint is uh getting new clients and finding a
(54:50) method that works so I can kind of scale that okay how do you get clients now so it's referrals from previous clients great and so you've done a good job what's the average loan sorry average loan Aver loan uh right now probably be around 7,000 say okay so this is like credit card stuff sorry is like credit card stuff or is this uh like loan loans loan loans interesting low ticket okay not there's definitely higher ones but usually to start off we like to start small and people build up their credit yeah yeah um and so you
(55:23) need more customers need more customers and need a way to figure out how to scale that we've plateaued and um the good thing about it is we've kind of like built up some money in the bank where we can allow ourselves to maybe do advertising or you know I've heard people said toach so for that business I would prob especially the ticket price you're at I would probably go um ads or referral Partners so those would be the those would be the two channels that I would see as like the most likely to succeed with that
(55:58) yeah sneeze of the sneeze of the of the event uh I just want to sneeze like that and just like see what people do um anyways so uh ads or I would do the referral Partners um and so referral Partners would be like okay well who else is dealing with these particular types of customers so it might be the credit repair companies and saying like I'm sure they have almost all those guys referr out business and so making your referral mechanism more valuable than other people's um that would be a big one because if you can the way that you can win there is if you convert a higher percentage of their customers than other
(56:36) people do then you'll be able to pay them more because a lot of people waste leads and there's plenty of companies that just like send the leads don't even ask for anything back and so you can be more aggressive on the acquisition to them you're like hey I can extend your LTV if you just like once you finish like repairing credit I can get them a bigger loan and I can pay you and so getting a handful of those referral Partners could be Mass massive for the business that's like you rely on some other people but it could scale pretty quickly and it's cheap or at
(57:02) least it's low risk how do you go about that's where you do Outreach so you do Outreach to get Affiliates and then the Affiliates send you business then you can be more targeted do that make sense because if you do Outreach then it's like what's the cost to acquire a customer the metrics there might be pretty tight for you if you're doing $7,000 loans I don't know what you make on a $7,000 loan so we're trying to get uh higher what do you make on a loan with $7,000 um generally 1,500 2,000 okay it just
(57:35) depends like yeah understood so with like $1,500 $2,000 of gross profit it's tight it's very tight for outbound and so like you it's you'd want more margin if you could and so that's why you're like okay well I'll go to an affiliate and maybe it cost me 10 grand to acquire an affiliate but then affiliate is going to send me 20 customers a month and so it cost me 10 to make 4 ,000 a month and then the metrics make amazing sense sorry just last and if we're so I have a few clients where I have been able to
(58:05) get to like the higher amount where I'm loaning maybe 50,000 100,000 like stuff like that and so we have like maybe three or four of those how would I be able to maybe reach those like bigger ones so I can you know not have to worry about ads in referral partners that would be and if you have referral Partners you tell them who you're looking for we specialize in people with 50 ,000 RS are higher if that's I mean like you just tell them what you want and then you can pay them even fatter slices so they might be interested in that

(00:00) hey what's going on everyone happy sunday hope you guys are rocking and rolling on your sunday morning evening afternoon whatever time zone you are watching or listening to this in um i recently have been doing a deep dive into funnel world um and ads for both b2b and b2c i've been kind of like taking a more frenzy report uh lately and so i wanted to make this because i recently had a gym owner send me some of their ads um and i was like oh crap these are definitely not going to convert and so i wanted to just give um
(00:29) basic headline stuff that will always just make you more money and so um the formula that i've used for all of the fitness ads that we ran that i ran at my gyms and that we continue to run is a simple formula has three parts to it all right the first part is duration all right because virtually every fitness based uh promotion that you're gonna run is gonna be uh x amount of weeks x amount of days whatever right so it's like 21 day 42 day 6 week 28 day 30 day one month whatever that is that's the first piece of your headline okay
(01:08) second piece of the headline and this is what i see people mess up is the kind of uh the benefit or the result okay so it'd be like six-week six-pack if it was for guys right 28-day bikini uh six-week booty 42-day detox uh uh like [ __ ] i'm trying to think um you can i mean if you want to even get a little bit more creative with it you could say like 28-day skinny friend right so now you're like then the copy is gonna reel that in and talk about how um is it wouldn't it be nice to always be the skinny friend right because now
(01:42) you're talking about status within the context of other people so you're looking at the prospect within the eyes or from the perspective of their friend right and so you have duration first okay in the headline and the second piece of the headline is going to be the benefit all right it could be leaning down slim down thin waist um you know small dress like that's where like the um a lot of really popular one was uh a little black dress right because that was the result that was the benefit right and so like like loosen a belt
(02:11) loop like two notches down on the belt loop so try and demonstrate what the result is going to be with the second piece and that's where just being creative as a marketer comes in all right so duration is simple make sure you have a duration first because that's where people wanted to see what kind of commitment or implied when they're going to achieve the result right so it's like if you have a 28-day drop to your belt or drop to belt notches like cool i get it dropped two belt notches in 28 days cool but you're not making a guarantee
(02:37) that's just the title of the advertisement okay the third piece to this is a power word all right and so a power word could be challenge it could be blueprint it could be accelerator it could be intensive it could be um of course i've like while i'm live um but it's words like that that are like program you know what i mean transformation all of those are going to be like the the period at the end of the sentence and so when you're making your ads this is the headline that would go in the banner all right this is the
(03:09) headline that goes in the banner once you've done that like if your ad doesn't have that the likely that it's going to convert is much lower period it's just like these are and what's what's interesting is you're like that sounds so basic alex i see ads all the time from gym owners even in our community that don't obey this and then they're surprised that they're not getting results like i made a video a couple days ago about like it it's like the news like if you look at the way the headlines look on the news
(03:33) they're still the same and they all they do is they just change the characters and your job is the reporters to go and grab the story and capture it right so um duration 28 day benefit you know six uh duration 28 day benefit uh six pack or uh you know skinny waist or smaller jean size or whatever right and then blueprint challenge transformation whatever it is is the third word all right and so that is how you go one two three and that is your formula for headlines now once you have that the next piece is going to be the
(04:13) creative i'm not going to get into the creative too much because i've made other videos about that but using the legion scrambler for whatever you want to put in your video or your image is going to work well right so that's going to be group workouts a pitch of you explaining what it is going to be any images of people sweating together in the group together testimonials work all of that stuff is creative and you can still use the same headline all right the headline doesn't have to be specific to the creative so it's like
(04:39) one of the biggest things that i've learned as a marketer is that you don't need that those two don't actually need to be connected okay i'll tell you where it does need to be connected in a second the next piece that you're going to have to this is when you actually go to the copy so i'm only specifically talking about facebook ads if you're marking on like gdn or other things and like those are banners and you have to have more steps to it but if you're just talking about facebook then what you're looking
(04:59) at then is the first line of the copy is going to be calling it who you want and who you don't want right like residents that are in this area right that's what you're like there's obviously compliance guidelines of making sure that you can't say you and you can't say like um you ladies because you can't identify the prospects cause facebook doesn't like that right and so you're gonna do your best to describe it without calling out um the person individually who's reading okay so it's who we're looking for and
(05:26) if not more importantly who we are not looking for okay that can be the first two lines and then you have your sub head right which is going to be tied back to the headline that we said so it's like if if we said the the 28 day skinny friend you know transformation or skinny friend accelerator whatever program doesn't matter right you go there it's like wouldn't it be nice to be the skinny friend for once we all have those friends right and that's the lead-in that's the lead into the ad it's like we all have those friends it seems
(05:54) like they can eat whatever they want and they never gain weight wouldn't it be nice to know that it's not their genetics it's actually their habits and those habits are programmable and teachable right now i'm like oh this is an interesting ad i want to read more it's like and over the last x years implied authority like we've done this with over a thousand people in this local area alone and right now we're opening up our spot in our 28 day blah blah accelerator and so if you want to be the skinny friend then click over right and say then call
(06:21) to action and so like this is a formula like like hopefully just from the way i'm describing this you can understand how this works so when you're making ads and this is what a lot of people are making ads is on sundays right when you're making the ads start with the headlines for the actual banner on the ad itself all right duration benefit slash results power word then you have your creative that's going to plug in that's really there just to get attention and make sure that they're like they pause and stop all right a fun
(06:50) side note is make sure that the color makes sense colors and fonts matter sometimes even more than the words so if you're doing a meme banner or a banner on the ad you want to make sure that you're not doing black and yellow or black and red for women right women are gonna be like that looks hardcore right same thing you don't want like stenciled spray lettering which is like kind of like hardcore gi joe lettering for women right it's not gonna work as well it has a different feel all right to the same extent if you're new at doing a guys
(07:18) based ad they're doing black and green black and blue like sort of male based colors is going to work fine you just want to make sure that you're matching those two to the prospect you're trying to attract all right and the next thing is like i said is the font right some fonts work either way like permanent marker is a font on google fonts works for guys or girls right so you can have white and pink in part in in permanent marker or font or you can have black and yellow or black and red or blue and black or whatever it is right
(07:45) obviously you can be in the middle and just do blue and white or blue green or blue and white or green and white or you know with black stencil whatever all that that stuff's fine right but make sure that you're matching that and these like these are definitely like the fundamentals like these are the basics but if you're not doing these and you'd be surprised how many people don't do the fundamentals like the advanced people just never don't do them and that's all it is okay so we're going back to the ad so we've got our headline it's in the
(08:09) right font that matches the prospect and it's in the right colors cool we have our creative which we know converts which is gonna be people working out together food pictures uh you know images of like sweaty selfies uh eye based images where someone's staring at the camera selfie pitch videos all of those type of videos work right for creative then uh you have your who you're calling out to to make sure that you both attract the right people but ward away the ones you don't the not the who it's not for is just as if not more powerful than who
(08:44) it is for all right because it shows that you're selective and you're going to be more magnetic and repulsive when you make that right like if you notice recently a lot of the gym launch ads that have come out have been like no personal trainers like we only want gym owners who have over 25 clients or full time have a signed lease and xyz and the reason for that is because we just did a data analysis on the clients that make the most money with us and stay the longest and guess what it's [ __ ] gym owners right and so
(09:10) so we're just making sure that we're 100 clear that that's just who we work with now you if you want to look at your own clients and find out which clients are actually worth the most to you and then put it in your copy ward off the people who aren't good and the people who do read that are like wow that's really me right then they're going to be way more likely to click and then the the quality of the click that you get is going to be much higher all right and the next thing finally is the subhead is the lead in right and
(09:36) that's usually going to be tied to the benefit slash result the middle word of your of your of your headline right and so if you did the 28 day lose two notches whatever transformation right um and this is where you'd have a little image of jeans and a belt or something on the banner right it would make sense and then when you're with the lead-in it's going to tie it back to that because like how is this connected and so you're going to connect that to like hey have you ever have you ever have you've noticed recently that you keep going up
(10:05) in notches every six months or so well the good news is it's not permanent and we know how to fix it right and then you're like boom then you can go into your normal copy okay so um if you were making your ads make sure to use those headlines make sure that the banners are set that way three pieces duration benefit slash results and then power word make sure that if the images slash copy are uh attention grabbing usually like the legion scrambler like just use that um and then when you are uh doing the copy on the top make sure you're attracting
(10:37) and repulsing the right people and then do your lead in your sub headline or what would be your sub headline because you don't want that actually the actual banner it's too many words but you want that sub head because if they read that then they're going to want to find out more they find out more than it's going to tie into what they just read and it's going to be relevant all right once they click from there to the page you want it to be congruent all right so if you're having a 28 day blah blah blah and this is where it's like this is
(11:02) where it takes work this is where like good marketers be mediocre marketers just by not being lazy and so then they make sure the page matches the offer and the benefits and the results that we're talking about on the ad because people clicked it's exactly what they want all right and so that's what we're doing here so you can have two funnels that are running for the same campaign just one's for men and ones for women that's a basic split right if you want to get more granular you can have older women and younger women i would imagine that
(11:28) you probably talked to a 55 year old woman differently talk to a 25 year old girl right of course you would right the messaging changes the way that the page probably looks different etc and so that's where you become a better marketer so anyways i hope that just gives you just like a quick overview in terms of gloss if you're making your ass today because it's sunday which is what a lot of our gym owners do make their ads um follow those guidelines you'll get more clicks you'll get more leads and if you found this valuable tag

Transcript:
(00:00) In this video, I want to talk to about why you're probably not closing as many sales as you hope you are. Now, there's a lot of opponents components to closing deals, right? You have the actual offer itself, price point, the prospect, the process they went through. So, I actually think there's five Ps in in that have to happen and be in alignment prior to the sale.
(00:15) So, the first is the promotion for the right prospect at the right price for the right product following the right process. Right? Those are the five Ps that I think through when I'm looking at an entire sales pipeline. But what I want to talk about specifically today is why even if you're following all those things correctly and you're getting on the phone and you have a script that you know works or your team has a script that you you wrote out because you know it works, right? If they're not closing, then it means that they may be saying
(00:37) the right things, but they may be saying it the wrong way. And so there's two components to saying the right things the right way. All right? So one is tone and the second is um is cadence, right? Is emphasis. And so I want to give you an example of both of those things. So, for example, if I were to um give you a script like, you know, Jerry Seinfeld's uh comedy script and you were to get on stage and you were to try and deliver that, right? The tone, the pauses that you would have would not be the same as
(01:07) his, right? His inttonations would be different than yours are. And so, as a result, he would be funny and you would not be. And you'd be wondering like, "Well, this worked for Jerry. Why is it not working for me?" And so, just like that, you may be looking at your team and wondering like, "Well, this works for me.
(01:21) Why is it not working for them?" and you're looking and they're saying the words, but you're like, "Why is this not working?" It's because they're saying them the wrong way. And so, let me illustrate this in a different way. So, if I were to say my own name, so if Ila, my wife calls me and she says, "Alex, right? Or Alex or Alex, right? All three of those are just my name, right? Said differently, have different meanings.
(01:39) " I'll give you another example. I got this from Jason Flinland. I love this. I didn't say he hit his wife. I didn't say he hit his wife. I didn't say he hit his wife. I didn't say he hit his wife. I didn't say he hit his wife. I didn't say he hit his wife. I didn't say he hit his wife. Right? And so each of those sentences has different meaning, right? Because of the emphasis that we put on the words.
(02:05) And so just like both. So one is you have the tone that you're using, the pauses where you put emphasis, right? And then you have how you're saying the words. And so what happens is you have somebody who's reading a script, but they aren't reading it the right way. There's two ways to fix this, right? One of them is to become a master salesman, right? And learn how to control your tone, right? Learn when to lower your voice so that what you're saying shows the prospect that it's really important, right? So, I'm slowing down what I'm saying, I'm
(02:33) lowering my tone so that you know that you need to pay attention to what I'm saying. Whereas, if I'm really excited, I'm talking about all this stuff, it's really exciting, and we're like, we're all we're all fast-paced, we're all up here, right? Then that's going to it's going to communicate something different even if we're both saying the same words.
(02:47) And so, one of those things happens from repetition, right? you learn, you start to learn this stuff cuz you're like, "Man, I nailed that sale. What did I do?" Right? And so, one of my side note recommendations for everyone is everyone here hopefully has been on a hot streak at some point. Like there's some days you get on the phone, you're like, "Man, I could just close anyone right now.
(03:02) " When you are hot, those are the videos you should watch. That's the game tape footage that you should go over and over and over again. Like in the be beginning, you might not have that. You have to watch other people's stuff. But when you're hot, you say things differently. You pause at different points. And it's those micro nuances that create master salesmen.
(03:20) And the true master salesman, right? The difference between a 250 batter and a 300 batter, right? For a baseball analogy, it's like one one hit every two or three games, right? It's not a huge difference. But that's the difference between a master salesman and a poor and a and an average salesman is that great salesmen never get cold.
(03:35) They are always on a hot streak because they know how to recreate success. And it's because they know how to say the things the right way for the right prospect. And so to wrap this up for you, if you have your sales team, right, the easiest tactic is to get them to a watch the footage of themselves when they were hot.
(03:51) And if they haven't, watch other people who were hot uh and what they were saying at that point because there are minor ways and tonality and shifts and pauses that you will do when you are assuming the clothes the right way, when you're projecting the confidence, when you have the conviction that communicates differently.
(04:07) Let me give you a fun tidbit that I found. Like we always close the highest percentage on our on our deals when we had people finishing our program, right? Because on the days that we would finish our cohorts, our groups of clients, we'd have all these success stories that would go again after another after another after another.
(04:22) We do all these interviews on one day. And so my sales team would watch this happen and then they would get on the phones and they would be so convicted about what they were selling. And so this leads into the two ways that you can fix this, right? So number one is you become a master salesman. You become a master salesman through repetition and through studying game tape footage, which is the first thing I said.
(04:39) The second way and the faster way of doing this is to believe in what you sell. This is hard. I'll be real with you, right? This is this is hard for a lot of people, especially if you're a business owner, because you know all the problems in your business. They're always going to be problems and those aren't going to go away.
(04:51) And so, one of the things that I have I have hacked in my own mind is is asking two other questions, which is I will never have a perfect product, and I'll tell you that right now, but I can have perfect intentions, right? And so that is something that you can delineate for yourself. Number one, and you know your intentions.
(05:06) So if your intentions aren't perfect, then you can fix those and you can have perfect intentions, right? But your product will never be perfect because you can always improve, right? The second thing in terms of improving it is knowing that the prospect will be better served working with you than with anyone else.
(05:22) And so that is something that I have I have looked at. And so this is easier for somebody who's getting into a marketplace and you can see the other competitors that are there. You may not be perfect, but you can believe that you were the absolute best shot that this person has to be successful. And this is especially true if you have some sort of education or training type business where someone is required to do something.
(05:41) So like if you were if you're helping someone with life coaching, you're helping someone with weight loss, you're helping someone with with their business. Like these are all skills that they have to develop. You cannot eat the food for someone, you cannot do the push-ups for someone, you cannot hop on the sales call for them.
(05:52) They have to learn the skill which means that you can provide something but they also have to come the other half the half the distance right and so the way to continue to have that conviction is one recognize your intentions. If you can fix your intentions to know that your intentions are perfect then that is going to be a huge step forward that you'll have over your competition because then it will force you it will cause you to say the things the right way because people can feel conviction.
(06:12) They can feel the subtle nuances of how you communicate and they will choose to believe you not based on what you say but on how you say it. And the second way is by making sure that your product is the best and that it is the best shot that this person has. You can't say, "I guarantee that you're going to lose weight.
(06:29) " I can't say, "I'll guarantee that you're going to make more money." Because you can't because you can't control the variables. But you can guarantee that you will be the best shot that this person has at being successful. And so for me, cracking that code uh mentally helped me a lot, especially in in weight loss sales when I was starting out, right? Because I would have someone in and I knew the stats.
(06:47) I knew that in 6 months, you know, half the people who were signing up weren't going to be at the gym. I knew that, right? But the thing is is I can't look at someone and say like, well, you know what, maybe maybe they shouldn't sign up because I mean, half the people aren't going to aren't going to show up, you know, within 6 months. But instead, I was able to shift, and this was something I had to learn that I'm still the best shot this person has at getting where they want to go, right? They're still going to have to do stuff on their part, but I know with
(07:08) conviction that my intentions are perfect and that I am the best shot they have at getting where they want to go. And that is the conviction that I can stand on that I can look someone in the eyes through their soul and tell them that I were the best shot for them to be successful. And that is how you can change the way you speak.
(07:22) So you can speak with conviction to a prospect. And that is what I found. And so hopefully you find this valuable. If you are not selling or your team is not selling the way you want it, it is not necessarily because of the words you are saying. Sure, it's all the the other things that I said, the promotion, the offer that you're running, right? The the process that you're taking them through, the price that you're selling at, uh who you are selling to, the prospect themselves, all of those things are going to be things that are going to weigh into
(07:41) whether or not it's successful. But once you are actually on the phone with the person, fundamentally a sale is simply a transfer of belief. And if you do not believe, then you cannot transfer that belief. And the way that you communicate belief is not in what you say, but how you say it.

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video i'm going to tell you the number one way to increase the percentage of sales that get closed by you and your team through a systematic process and if you don't know who i am my name is alex romizzy i own acquisition.com it's a portfolio of service coaching e-learning info businesses that do about 85 million a year and so the reason i want to make this is years ago i was recruited to bring in or to be brought in and flown in for a sales consulting gig which i don't do and it was it was years ago but the team
(00:28) was selling mortgage leads and so they wanted me to do is the first half of the day i i took apart the the actual sales script and rescript everything kind of reframe the offer all that kind of stuff and the second half of the day i was supposed to train the team and so after spending the first half on that talking to the founders all that kind of stuff the second half they had a nine person team and they were selling mortgage leads and when i walked in the first thing that i asked the team was hey and they were like hey this guy
(00:52) john's been kind of a problem i was like okay cool i was like hey john how good are the leads whole team's there it's quiet ever like pressure's on john he's like well i mean they're uh and i was like i'm good thanks so much and everyone was like what is happening i was like dude i can give you the best script in the world i was like but if you don't believe in the product i was like none of this is gonna matter i said if you believed in the leads i was like you wouldn't even need the script because if you were to ask me the same
(01:17) question and i truly believe that these leads were amazing i would be like dude these leads are sick i mean right now my my cousin is a realtor and i'm sending her leads right now because she's already building so much of a pipeline from it i'm actually studying for a realtor exam so that i can so i can buy these leads from this company and not even sell these but sell houses instead right because houses have a much bigger ticket than these leads do and so for me like i'm just basically waiting to get through to that point so that i can move
(01:43) out on my own but yeah i mean these leads are awesome so the way that you talk about the products that you have will indicate the level of conviction that you have and the best sales people are true believers and you that's why a lot of great salesmen come from clients who've used the products and services if it makes sense for them you know for for their life and whatnot and so people will believe like if you think about what sales really is it's a transference of conviction and so you've got some person who doesn't believe one person who does
(02:11) believe and trust is what completes the transfer and you have to duplicate the conviction in this person in this person and so if a salesperson doesn't believe in the product they have no way to transfer the conviction because they have no baseline of conviction to work off and a different version of this happens when people start hot they do really well and all of a sudden they start not selling as well it's not because they don't know how to sell and training is not the thing that's going to fix the problem because they're
(02:37) already closing before and they're not closing now it means they've changed something and oftentimes it's because they've heard something from one of the prospects they sold that something was not good and so the way to prevent this and to actively increase conviction which is what's going to change the way they say the words on the script is by actively having a process to make them believe and so obviously the way to make a believe is to actually have a good product but in terms of systematizing that it's having a regular cadence
(03:05) between customer success and sales so this is me getting a little bit operational with you but this is how it works you meet weekly and you have both teams on and the people from customer success share the wins of the clients who are going through the program that's on a weekly basis it's a long form format it also serves as as a way for them to talk back and forth to each other the sales team can see what's happening on the customer success size customer system can see what's happening on the sales side and you create cross
(03:29) departmental knowledge which is really useful because the sales team knows not to say some things because people are misunderstanding them and the success team is giving the sales team ammunition for the things that they know that they're doing to deliver that makes them more convicted on top of that you should have a pipeline that is established for customers where you can collect testimonials and reviews and what you do is in the best case scenario you have that client hop on with the sales team and explain their story and i can tell
(03:53) you this because me first hand one of the things that i realized when i looked at our stats was that on saturdays and particular saturdays we were closing like 100 of people were walking the door and i was like huh what's different about these days at my facilities versus the days that we're not you know we're closing a normal amount and it turned out that those days were the days that we would actually do the way outs for our program so people would finish their six week or their 12 weeks or whatever it was and we would do all the way outs
(04:18) on the same day and so it's kind of like a graduation ceremony so everyone steps on they're crying they're losing weight they feel amazing but all of my team was there and so when we had sales consults that were that morning or throughout the graduation day or right after the graduation well it's all fresh in their mind they would when someone walk in it's like the sales took half as long because the belief and the conviction was so strong in the salesman it overcame the fears and the doubts of the prospect right and so in a lot of ways
(04:46) you have to compensate for lack of conviction with training and you know learning logical based frameworks and and learning how to have excellent conversation right that help people make decisions but if you truly believe and if you think about how we buy things as prospects we buy these things because somebody recommends them and we believe the person like think about an organic buying process right someone says hey have you gone to that sandwich shop it's awesome like you're like well great i'm gonna go there right like why
(05:15) would i not and so the closer you can have the trust so that when you make the recommendation it's like having a referral the person will believe you because the way you are saying it is believable and the way to make it believable is to actually believe it and so having a structured process of increasing the conviction of the sales team is a way to massively increase the closing percentages of your team not based on skill but based on heart and so if you can bridge that gap between the customer success and the sales team and
(05:45) you can do that both internally and externally internally because you have processes externally because you get those customers on the call so they can hear the stories but also you and the sales directors can read those testimonials every single day to them in the morning and i like that because it sets the cadence for the day because it reminds us why we do what we do on a regular basis why am i taking these calls why am i knocking on these doors why am i setting up shop and and collecting leads at the whole foods so
(06:11) that i can so we can make sales later like why am i doing this i'm doing this so that i can be a part of this transformation these people are going through as a result of whatever products and services we sell and so the sales team probably more like customer support and sales i feel like are very similar in that they get beat up all day long and sales people especially and so this is for the founders and the ceos are going out there and they're fighting for you every single day they're the front line in my opinion they're the offensive
(06:38) line of the team they're just pushing they're in the in the trenches moving the ball forward every you know one two yards at a time they're chipping away at it let's see if i can get this camera back and they're pushing your products forward every single day on your behalf and so the biggest thing that a sales director and if you're the sales director because your business is smaller is that you have to breathe conviction into them because their conviction can wane over time and it's a cup that has to be refilled because it's
(07:06) that conviction that they're spreading to all the prospects and the thing is the prospects are spreading doubt into them and so you have to fill it up from your side so that they can become diluted and then get refilled right which is why a good salesperson comes in they can crush and all of a sudden they start going down it's not because of skill because they already had the skills they already knew how to they already knew how to close when they came in the problem was their mojo is off mojo mojo mojo and so this video is fundamentally
(07:32) about fixing mojo within a sales team which is just getting them to believe and reminding them to believe which is why one of the biggest sayings i have in sales is we need to be reminded more than we need to be taught people who believe in something automatically sell it and i'll give you a final final example to drive this point home i'll just use the the christian community overall or really just any kind of religious community in general a big part of most faiths is spreading the faith and you can tell when someone truly believes the faith
(07:59) they're on fire with the face because they they truly believe it and it's not like people go through sales training right to bring people to faith they just truly believe in it and if you've ever been around someone who has absolute conviction because conviction and this is a key point is not do you believe in the product do you not believe in the product but to what extent do you believe in the product how much and how deeply do you believe that is the predictor of your ability to close a massive predictor of your ability to
(08:30) close which is why so many founders are always some of the best promoters for their businesses because they believe in it more than anyone else and they should be but you can duplicate that ability in getting other people to believe by having a process in place to do so and understanding that the training of the blocking tackling in terms of like say this and that and say this and that sure it's important it's good to have those they're tools right they're tools that you have in your tool belt but the fundamental work ethic that someone will
(08:55) fight and their desire to actually help someone is the difference between them thinking about themselves so they can get their commission check and then thinking about the prospect and how this person is missing out on something that's genuinely going to help them and really transform their life and really solve the problems that they have and they will fight for the sale so much longer because they genuinely want this person to win because they genuinely believe that your products and services are actually going to help them and so
(09:19) bridging that gap and understanding this for myself was so important because a lot of times we get obsessed with the drills and all that stuff and you have to do that stuff for sure you have to drill you have to understand how to say the words all that kind of stuff but the heart if you can if you could change the heart and you can depth in right because it's not just like i said it's not just do they believe but how deeply convicted can i get this team to be and that is where having proof where you're actively
(09:43) selling your sales team that is where you will get the outsize returns in my opinion on increasing the effectiveness of the team is that they truly and deeply to their core belief and the last point that i was making is if you've ever been around someone who truly believes in something and it's like kind of insane like whatever the thing is like it could be aliens it could be whatever right like something crazy but they are like so sold on it there is an element of yourself that wonders if you're right because you have conviction
(10:09) too in whatever you believe and so you see their depth of conviction their depth of faith in the thing that they have concluded and the deeper it is the more you start to question your own beliefs which is why the pastors of huge churches typically have deep deep faith and if like there's a lot to study in terms of converting people literally because you're changing someone's entire world view and so if you study the process that people come to faith and how they convince others to come to faiths in general there's a lot of
(10:41) elements of selling that occur there in helping people make decisions to help themselves and so the person who typically does the converting can never believe less in the thing that they're trying to convert someone into than the person who's being converted the person has to believe in your conviction more than they believe in their doubt in the story that they have been telling themselves and so the skills are simply a way to clearly communicate and build trust so that your conviction can be transferred but it starts with having
(11:10) the conviction to begin with in order to initiate the transfer over the bridge of trust and so this is the number one thing that i see missing from sales trainings and it's one of the easiest things that we can do to implement in a team or even in yourself to improve your numbers overall in your business all right and if you don't know i am i probably said it earlier but if i didn't my name auction mostly we own acquisition.
(11:31) com portfolio of services info coaching course businesses that do about 85 million a year and so i make these videos because i struggled a lot coming up and i just if i if there's any lessons that i can share i would prefer that my pain not have been in vain all right so lots of love and i'll see you guys next video bye

A YouTuber Asked Me "How To Business". Here's My Answer - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4pZwlE86A5Y

Transcript:
(00:00) this is unspeakable he's been doing YouTube for 10 years and has 200 million people who watch his videos every single month we're gonna break down his business and how he's going to go to a billion plus let's dive in I have so many puns that I want to say like speechless unspeakable I don't I won't I won't do any of those but I want to this was an idea that air rack because he and I were talking he's like dude you should do this kind of like a mini series for your channel talk with people with big audiences like how would you think
(00:27) through what opportunity to go after it so I feel like so many people are just like lost like what do I just like yeah what do I sell there's so many options like I could sell energy drink I could sell germax I could sell these conference tables like it's literally endless yeah you could launch umbrellas or you could launch Kleenex boxes that are unspeakable unblowable um one down and make money and so the problem is that a lot of I feel like YouTubers influencers see one influencer do something make some money and then
(00:56) think oh I'll do the same thing and then end up with a massively under monetized like opportunity okay we've got the market here we've got the brand here and then we've got different monetization Vehicles like what is the thing that kind of overlaps all three that works really well so there's like three kind of vehicles so you have unspeakable the main thing the biggest thing it's like driving all the revenue yeah and then you have 0 to 60 which is a new business that's actually why I'm here in Vegas for SEMA it's an automotive shop paired
(01:24) with content and then the third idea revolved around a consumable product I don't I won't say what we want to call it yet because the names are still kind of in the air unspeakable but it might be it's not unspeakable but basically what we I really want to build a company similar to what Red Bull has because I know so much about content and I know so much about you know all these platforms I could build a marketing company sell a consumable whatever fits that like target audience that I'm trying to Target but and that's all primarily
(01:51) driven off the Unspeakable channel right uh I don't know I I probably want to do like a separate channel for it just because unspeakables kind of got its own thing like it's for kids you know what's the age uh I would say a large majority are like 12 to 16. so right now I sell merch for unspeakable but my idea was to kind of launch like a toy brand um and just see where we can go with that we have talked about the energy drink idea right yeah so that's what I love but that would be that third idea I don't know I just don't I don't feel
(02:22) like it would fit the Unspeakable audience maybe it would maybe yeah but um they're just a bunch of kids and I just don't you know like I wouldn't call it unspeakable yeah if I was to launch a drink no for sure well it doesn't have to be exactly what I mean yeah yeah but the other thing that worries me is like so I'm unspeakable right the brand revolves around me the question is how long can I be unspeakable yeah like you know right right now I'm almost 25 years old when I'm 13 years you know when I'm when I'm 35 am I still going to be wanting to
(02:56) do that probably not um like I've tied myself to unspeakable for the past 10 years so I can't really get rid of it I can't like hire some other people to come in and just kind of like change who I am you know that's like if the rock was like oh I don't want to be the rock anymore so I'm gonna hire this guy like it just doesn't work you know like I love the energy drink for like the crazy all the stuff that you're you know filling your house with sand today I'm gonna be feeling my entire Island house with sand Maybe I'm
(03:21) Wrong right yeah it could it could fit the Unspeakable audience but I want it to like expand I want it to go to like you know like skateboarders and snowboarders and like I I don't want just like kids that love ball pit balls and Nerf guns to drink my energy drink you know what I mean yeah I see the original distribution base it's just like the launch pad and the only thing that keeps it going is new distribution and the product itself being good enough that people who are in the first ring tell their friends and like that's the
(03:47) part that most people [ __ ] up they're like I'll just slap my name on this thing it's white label I completely agree I just know that I'm not going to want to film videos for the next you know 30 years of my life like there's already plenty of days where I dread videos I still love them like they're so they're so much fun but I I know in like I know when I'm 36 years old I'm not gonna be like oh yeah I'm so ready to you know fill my house with balls and yeah let's put on let's put all the sand in I don't know if I
(04:15) could see me doing it for that long but when you start doing the car stuff isn't that still gonna be video too yeah but uh we're actually looking for like co-hosts so I just want to be the creative brains of the channel just kind of like help Direction can we segue real quick into the car shop thing yeah is the primary motivator for the car shop making money eventually franchise is it to have like lots of locations or is it just for content to have a spot to make content so there's like three branches to the business like you have the shop
(04:41) uh you have the content side and then you would have the marketplace side which doesn't exist right now but we're working on building it like Parts yeah so like parts custom mods and things like that yeah that I see being the biggest part of the business I have a lot of people that follow me that are actually interested in cars because when I first started my unspeakable Channel like six years ago older now all I did was car content oh yeah so I started doing car Vlogs I had like a GTR I went to like car meets I like went on rallies
(05:09) because uh at the time I just did daily Vlogs I was just like yo guys this is my life that was what the Unspeakable channel was like six or seven years ago and then you started seeing what was hitting and the crazier [ __ ] you did yeah yeah because YouTube like six years ago was like Vlogs like Casey neistat was like the biggest YouTuber and he literally just walked around New York City making really good entertaining videos but it was just a day of his life yeah that's what YouTube was you had a bunch of other creators like Mr Beast
(05:35) and other guys come in and they're like okay this is the new YouTube this is challenges yeah where people are like all right survival this survive on this so I was like I need to like change that so that's where everything else came in and so if we're optimizing around how do we make you the most money short and long term right and really more so long term it's clear that you love this one like I mean just from like your energy when we're talking about it yeah and this is just like your cash cow perfect world is this didn't start just
(06:03) from a business perspective yeah is that you only had unspeakable you're making a good amount of money from unspeakable and AdSense every month of all the things I'm going to do I'm going to leverage the existing massive media audience that I have and find one thing that they can all buy and then that would be all that you would do then we have a phase out plan for you getting out of so it's like okay next six months or next 12 months you're co-hosting one to three people who are with you in the shows as regulars and then you just do
(06:28) one of these and then they're leading at most of it and you're making a couple appearances and then you fall off the table Yeah Yeah unspeakable could transition to something like Red Bull when you think of Red Bull you don't think of one person like you just think of like crazy anything crazy yeah right I still think that an energy drink is not bad I feel like the energy drinks Market is so saturated totally if you put the same amount of attention to making the product the way you do videos where it's like how does it taste in the
(06:57) beginning how does the aftertaste like if you like if you were to break it down at that micro level of really making an exceptional product you're excellent at what you do so like that character trait will carry over you know what I mean if you apply it to this so if we're analyzing opportunity it's number of units sold times gross profit potential per unit divided by competitive mode number of people times the amount of money made so like for me we do deals with a very tiny percentage of people but the amount of money that I make on a
(07:21) deal is significantly higher and so for me that cross-section even though it's itty bitty bitty still makes it worth it for me right because for that small person helping them go from 10 to 100 million is very meaningful yeah and so I can help a tiny amount of people a lot and then help everyone else for free and so we just have to figure out what that slice is what do you like this so you've got the car thing you dig that what else do you dig like what is your what are your what do your people know about you
(07:46) I mean just having fun with friends and just making videos it's just kind of the whole vibe of like yeah so you get money from AdSense and whatnot but do you have any other brand sponsorship deals like Integrations into videos yeah okay so which so what are those advertisers Nerf Legos Elmer's Glue we've done some with WWE okay Five Hour Energy pop Pockets honey like the website yeah yeah a bunch of like small mobile game companies do they reach out to you do you reach out to them they all reach out to us really
(08:18) of opportunity Vehicles the game would be by far number one it would hit the most amount of the audience you'd make the highest gross profit per User it's operationally from a fulfillment standpoint the easiest to handle the big hard part is like building a software game that's actually really good I've seen so many YouTubers make games and doesn't matter the following that they have like if the game sucks the game sucks the game sucks the game sucks like I like the energy drink angle the only issue with these though is that they're
(08:48) cash eaters which sucks what I'm gonna say you may or may not like so just take it for for what it is how can you do more of what we're currently doing because like of the plays like I like that one a lot High likelihood of success right within your wheelhouse like there's only a couple tweaks it's like okay find the other co-hosts like if you're like well that's kind of hard it's like well so is building a [ __ ] software company like it's all hard right it's all hard but like this one you know like all the other variables
(09:17) you've got down I feel like doubling down on the media might be the play you could probably like tomorrow 5x how much money you make just by building out the sponsorship bar that's all that you have to do I kind of limit my scale on unspeakable because I have to be in all the videos right yeah I have to figure out who my co-hosts are and start sprinkling them in seeing how the audience reacts to them finding one or two people that are three people that they really like and then rotating them in and to the point where ideally and
(09:44) speakers will be a group two or three people that are kind of like hosting and leading things along playing off each other characters right yeah so like scaling the content that way because I think the growth for the channel could be so much faster we put out 52 videos a year right we could put out 100 that are all the same quality of those 52 but it's just limits all my time because you know I have to sleep eventually but when someone pays you a million bucks or whatever to do a year of sponsorships it's like that goes
(10:13) straight to your bottom line that is not common like which is why media businesses are wonderful business like Warren Buffett had all of these newspapers because it's media it's one of the most profitable businesses on the planet and you're good at it which is hard what's the saying where it's like I don't know who said this but it was like if you're good at sales you can you know make a million five million 10 million but if you're good at marketing yeah you can make billions right um well there's Instagram from Naval
(10:36) ravacon which is you only sell because you don't know how to Market and you Landmark is you know how to build a product yeah and what's cool about your product is that it is both marketing and product it's one of the unique things about the media business is that how you Market the thing that you have is also how you fulfill that thing that's only a media thing like no other businesses like that where the marketing is the Fulfillment if we were to plan this out and say hey if you could Forex your income in the next four years would you
(11:00) do it just from the Unspeakable income well if the answer is yes then it's like well then we could reverse engineer that like that's super doable I would bet that in that four-year span there is an opportunity like somebody who approaches you who's got another energy drink brand is like we already have funding Etc and we just want to face for it or we want a brand to associate with and then you can do a brand deal with that company but you do it for Equity litmus test number one is like you love the product the
(11:23) road path for unspeakable now feels pretty clear to me how do you feel about that no I like it and then you also have this car thing even here building the the car parts thing like that'll definitely make money I like I like that as a business model and if unspeakable didn't exist I would say yeah just do that you thought about it before you built it you were like I'm gonna build the content arm I'm going to monetize over here and sure we'll make some money at the shop whatever if that's a complete business model in my
(11:48) mind and it makes sense because it's fully integrated into the videos it's like hey we just put this custom mod thing on the lambo by the way you guys can check it out I've got 20 available first 20 can go get it on the shop side I already have a partner so to kind of run and operate the whole shop the shop okay yeah the shop is what is going to open first okay the content it's kind of like whenever we get a piece of content whenever we get access to the new Mercedes that came out you know my main role is just to kind of oversee like
(12:13) Direction and making sure they're creative is you know on point the marketplace doesn't even exist yet if you were to do the marketplace it would take the same amount of energy and attention and effort as scaling unspeakable likelihood of achievement lower than unspeakable yep upside about the same you already have a partner who's running the Ops that's good I think all you need is just have somebody who's Junior running the content who wants to like Mentor under you which you have I'm sure can find somebody who
(12:38) would just like live with you and read this stuff this is the main thing this is the baby this is what you're the best at I really want the best in the world at do more of that and then the only thing that you're going to attribute over here you're dropping the marketplace you have the partner to run the day-to-day Ops is just somebody to run the content for the car shop and then you can sell sponsorships and whatnot that'll go through there which is actually kind of nice because then this one starts to merge with the path
(13:00) of this one so that your attention will start to consolidate in terms of like how you make money and how you think through things but now it feels really simple yeah feel better easy enough yeah well both all of these are hard this one has so few unknowns based on what you already have in the experience congrats so on everything thank you so much yeah he's right

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on everyone alex ramosa here founder of jim launch allen prestige labs and owner of a couple other companies um and today i'm going to talk to you um about how to sell some stuff all right so there's um there's there's three types of questions um i think i've talked in other videos about how um how to structure your sales conversations but i haven't talked as much about the nature of the questions and the types of responses that you're getting right and so in a sales process right you're you have some questions that are
(00:30) going to be mining questions that's trying to extract information from the prospect and the remainder of the questions are questions to get agreement right so you're going to put a proposition out there and ask for agreement right and if you get enough agreements it's going to be natural that they're going to want to move forward working with you now the way that you structure these questions all right i would say that you have yes-based questions you have um neutral questions and then you have negatively inclined questions
(00:54) all right first time i heard about this from chris voss he's the guy who does the um he wrote the book never split the difference really interesting stuff um and so a yes-based question would be like sound great yes that sounds great right a neutral type of question would be like fair enough does that sound fair does that sound reasonable to you right they'd be like well that sounds reasonable now it's still technically a yes-based question but the question that we're asking has a neutral tone to it all right because we're not saying hey
(01:23) is this the most amazing thing you've ever heard of like do you think this is the most amazing program the amazing product like blah blah that's asking a lot of someone right for them to agree to that so that would be a harder yes to get it's easier to get something like a a reciprocal yes which i would say someone says you know that's a lot and we say no worries what if we did this fair enough they say well he made a concession that sounds fair or if we did this does that sound reasonable that's not like a fair expectation yes
(01:52) it does great and then you can go to close the sale and if you've heard any of my past sale stuff one of my favorite closes which i got from jordan belfort um is fair enough right i just love this clothes so much because it's like fair enough right you make a concession fair enough and so many times we were like well they made a concession and i'm a reciprocal human being it's very hard for me to deny this request and say yes i do believe it's fair and then you say boom then let's move forward right but this is one that i learned very
(02:18) recently um that i really like and i when i look back through my actual conversations i do this and that's why i think it's so interesting because i'll i'm gonna i'm gonna be i'm gonna level with you really quickly all the people that i know who teach sales are natural born salesmen which is interesting right they're natural born salesmen i don't know a lot of people who who teach sales who weren't naturally very good at it quickly right um and so there are some things that people naturally do because they've had a lot of experience doing it and
(02:52) usually you get a lot of experience doing it because when you start doing it you get enough success that you can you can steamroll right um and grow and get a lot of volume and then once you do lots of volume then you can master at it but you had some sort of inclination or proclivity towards the skill all right um that being said it doesn't mean that anyone else can't become a great salesman it just means you might have to have more reps to get there now that being said no base statements this is actually where you
(03:18) you go in opposition right and so the reason and the psychology behind this per my understanding and it makes complete sense to me at least is that people feel safer saying no people feel like they retain their autonomy they feel like they're they're at ease it's harder especially like you think about decision fatigue at the end of the day people don't want to be responsible or anything they don't feel vulnerable to saying yes and agreeing to something right instead they prefer to say no and stay safe right but if you phrase your questions
(03:45) properly you can get people to say yes by saying no which is one of the most powerful sales taxes i shared in a different video where richard schwartz taught me how to get someone to say yes by saying no hey you don't want anything else do you no i don't want anything else and by doing that they got 95 of people to take an upsell all right now no base question this is something like would you be opposed to moving forward today would it be completely unreasonable for us to get started at the end of this conversation
(04:10) um would it be a completely would it would be completely out of left field for me to say that we should start you know start start working together today um so it's all of these would you be opposed to would you be against would it be unreasonable right all of those things are no based kind of antecedents or sorry precedence that that that lead into a no base question and so think about this if i said and i'm going to give you the same same kind of scenario here if i'm trying to get my wife to go where i want to go to dinner right
(04:40) because i want to go to cheesecake factory the finest establishment in the land all right count it get the cajun chicken little so you can get them half grilled and half uh half a half right and get the get the sauces from the thai lettuce wraps anyways um if i say hey babe you want to go to uh cheesecake factory she might be like well no i don't want to go to cheese factory right or like i'm not really sure right now if i switched that and i said would you be against going to cheese factory well i'm not against going to tca
(05:08) factory and i'm like great let's go and so that's the beauty of a no base question see how different it free it's phrased right and if i say hey you excited to move forward today that's a yes right it's harder to get someone to say yes i'm excited before today would you be opposed to moving forward at the end of the conversation no i'm not opposed to moving forward great and we get the sale and so this is really interesting because um what i find because there's there's lots of uh literature on you know getting
(05:34) people to say lots of yeses and trial closes and things like that throughout the sales process but in my mind these are all still ways of getting agreement which is the goal so it's simply using psychology in terms of how people like to respond to things how they feel in the moment of you know saying yes makes them feel vulnerable saying no makes them feel safe and leveraging that now that that being said it doesn't mean every single question you have to ask has to be a no based question but i think if you if you can rephrase a
(06:03) couple of the key milestone questions that you have in your sales conversations or if you feel like you're kind of closer to the edge with someone leaning towards a no based question i think is something that natural salesmen do well automatically like is it unreasonable for us to move forward today right would you be opposed to moving forward today would you be opposed to knocking out the paperwork should be opposed to are you against xyz right oh no i'm not against it all right let's rock and roll right um all of these are still ways to get
(06:28) questions and so i think that in some of my sales scripts right now we're going to be shifting from fair enough clothes drive is so wired in my brain from doing it so many times um to some no based phrasing uh because it's easier to get agreement with prospects especially even if they're kind of fatigued at the end of the day or which is when people are less likely to want to say yes to things um counter example there could be decision fatigue and they just want to say yes to to get done with it right depends on the
(06:57) size of the purchase but anyways i hope this was valuable for you in terms of phrasing behind the questions obviously this is not for mining based questions where you're trying to extract information from someone um and to better understand this is really where you're trying to get agreements um towards milestones to work together all right so i hope this made sense keep being awesome lots of love i'll catch you guys soon bye

Why I don't go home for the holidays - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sGHbp0Vr1dQ

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video i want to talk to you about the growth uh that i had to go through as an entrepreneur going from zero to 85 million dollars a year um and one of the things that i decided to stop doing which is going home for the holidays and i want to explain the decision making process around this and this comes from this is an older video that i did release into a smaller community and in that group uh i can see the best performing videos um and out of 300 plus videos this is among the top uh performing and so uh people seem to very
(00:27) much like this and as we're going into the holidays at least the time i'll me posting this i thought it would be timely but it really doesn't matter what holiday uh you were you're celebrating it's really a video about how to navigate our pasts and use them to walk with strength and conviction into the future that we choose to create and a lot of time it comes from shedding old identities and learning how to unspeak the things that were spoken over us in our childhood from our parents from our friends those who do not understand the
(00:58) path that you're trying to go on as an entrepreneur those who think that what you're doing is stupid those who do like who just don't believe um and at the end of the day we need to believe and we also need to create conditions that are conducive to the goals that we have in our lives and so this video gives you the most tactical raw breakdown of how i did it and i got so many people who told me that the video changed their lives in terms of how they approached uh their pasts and the people and the relationships that they maintain there
(01:24) and how to protect their space tactically in a way that will give you the um the attention back to allocate towards the things that matter so uh moseynation uh i hope you enjoy the video this is just uh because i love entrepreneurs and i want you to crush it there's a lot of people who are broke and i want you to be one of them see you in the vid good morning happy saturday i'm really excited for this because i've actually had this concept on my mind this piece probably for the last two and a half weeks i feel like it's been like in the
(01:54) back of my mind like percolating and whatnot and it's combining with like four or five other ones and i like felt it this morning as i was eating breakfast i was like all right today's the day i'm gonna make it but recently i wanted to call this why don't go home for the holidays there's probably gonna be some things that i say that are a little bit controversial but there are things that have have absolutely been some of the keys to our continued growth and success and i thought you might want to hear them and so i put the title as this for at
(02:18) least for right now as success equals ingrained intolerance so one of the reasons that i don't go home for the holidays is that a lot of people haven't haven't grown since i left right they they haven't had 10 years of growth they've lived the same six months 20 times right since i was gone and when i go back they want to meet me in my past and so they want to speak things over me that aren't who i am anymore and then because it's difficult for them to connect right the their perception of who i used to be and
(02:52) who the person is standing in front of them how they reconcile thank you um reconciling those two things is really difficult for a lot of people because it's breaking the box they want to put you in but the reality is that most people don't change entrepreneurs do because we have to right we call it growth instead of change but for the outside world for the non-entrepreneurs who stay in their same box every day it's it's it's hard to calculate and so i'll go home and they'll say like my dad says this they'll say
(03:22) you have a you have the shortest views out of anyone you just have such a short temper anyone who is in our company my wife like i mean anyone who knows me and spends time with me would probably not say that and so i will be i mean very aggressive in combating that immediately because i'll be like don't speak that over me that's not true that's not who i am and it makes people really uncomfortable and so there's a lot of times if i go see an uncle you know what i mean if i'm at a holiday event and then they're like
(03:52) oh alexander you've always been a little bit loose with the alcoa like i don't even drink anymore you know what i mean like you're speaking about my past and it makes people really uncomfortable and i would implore you to meet those things head-on and the reason that i don't like going home for the holidays because i have to be on guard because when i when i leave i feel like i have to like wash myself of the things that people were trying to speak over me and it's constant it's un it's unending it's incessant right they're
(04:24) constantly trying to put me back in the box that makes sense to them i refuse to have that happen and so when i have these conversations it's it's passing comments it's little things it's never because most people aren't confrontational right and so it's never oh like you are like you don't mean like it's it's not like that but it's just like oh you know how you always are and they'll say it even with like a smile like it's like it's a good thing but like you have to catch it because you know how it makes you feel when you
(04:51) hear it you're like that's not true that's not me right i'm i'm done with that that's in my past right and so like this is who i am and so i have to take like a week to detangle and then basically re-speak over the things that i am or that i choose to be it's one of the main reasons that i don't go back for the holidays and i really really don't like it and i definitely don't like spending any portion of extended time there is because it feels like i'm going backwards you know what we are all as a community trying to accomplish is not
(05:21) normal and we just have to come to terms with the fact that it isn't normal it's okay that it's not normal but it also means that normal people aren't going to like it the higher up we go in business i think at least this is just my subjective understanding of how i'm how i'm perceiving it as i go through it the more intolerant we become of people who try and i mean it's even tones like i'll be like don't speak to me in that tone even if they're saying that i think i'm like it seems disrespectful it bothers me
(05:50) and like you become more and more aware because you're like let me teach you how to treat me right and sometimes you have to do that and especially when it's been a long period of time you have to teach people how you like to be treated now and a lot of times it's a lot different than it was when they first met you right and it's the hardest with family because i'll be really real with you there's a lot of people that i'm connected with that i probably would never see again if i didn't have a blood relation i manage
(06:16) our space very well if we you know if we go back it's only going to be for a short period of time because there's no other reason besides the fact that we share a biological bond that i would ever see you again because you haven't you don't have the same goals you don't have the same values you don't want to do the things i want to do when we see each other you make me feel worse why would i see you right i'm just being very real with you guys and maybe this is something that i'll look back at this video five years from now and i'll have grown
(06:40) more and i'll have more perspective but that's that's where we are now being so intolerant of this stuff is like is so key to being able to like grow i'm telling you because and that's why that's why there's just we keep such quiet space right because it's like the only place that you don't have to have your guard up constantly fending off what other people are trying to tell you about yourself right and so you can kind of build it while it's while it's in its infancy and you're not as strong yet in these new
(07:07) attributes that you're trying to have i was talking to a high-level entrepreneur uh yesterday who's like ah i mean i'm just horrible at details and i was like don't speak that over yourself i was like because your business might need you to be good at details when you go from 10 to 20 million don't say that and he was like you're right i was like yeah you choose you're choosing to not be good at details do you really think that if your kids were going to die like because you need to learn to remember things to be able to do it like well
(07:31) yeah i'm like all right then you're choosing to not be good at it that's your choice that's your belief right and so like if you identify these things like man i'm getting really deep on this i know but like the identity is so fluid we can change in an instant like tony robbins talks about this stuff all the time like the only moment that we're actually able to live in is right now right and so all of the things that we had before us are only stories that we can either choose to replay because they're positive
(07:57) attributes or choose to ignore if they're negative attributes and a lot of us just stay in these loops of of speaking these these things over ourselves that don't even serve us right one of my favorite sayings in the world probably one of my favorites like one of the most profound sayings is we question all of our beliefs except for those that we truly believe and those we never question at all and i always i love that because it just makes you aware of like i love catching myself on a belief that i've always had
(08:25) that i believe so thoroughly that i never actually thought to question it because that's how much i believed it right it's just been there and so like the higher up we go the more we kind of uncover these beliefs about what's possible what can we do how can we grow how how quickly can change happen you look at our business right like we pivoted from a done 40 model to the done with you model that we have now in april of 2017 right and so from april of 2017 until today right that's like 19 months i think right we've gone from zero to
(09:01) arguably the biggest company in fitness like in in the brick and mortar gym fitness world and we're like two or three times the size of anyone else who's like the second runner up 2019 we're gonna probably three to four x that i can say that pretty with a lot of certainty and so like how quickly are you able to achieve what you want to achieve is it supposed to take a year because you're choosing to believe that it's supposed to take a year how quickly can you onboard someone let me give you another story we're about to do a very big
(09:28) launch for our legacy group i can't tell you what it is but a friend of mine launched a new service category in his business and it blew up overnight he had a huge explosion of traffic he was running like some ads and they just took off right he couldn't do anything about it and so he hired 30 people in 14 days for his customer service team 30 people in 14 days and so when we had our q4 planning right our fourth quarter planning we had our customer service director and i and lily i love you to death it has nothing to do
(09:55) but like this was what happened during the during the actual meeting she was like i feel comfortable saying that i can bring four people on every month between now and x launch date right which would you know get us to probably 16 or so people 16 to 20 right by the launch date which is going to be like three or four months away and so then i told that story about my friends who had just done this he hired 30 people in 14 days because he had to and so a lot of times the necessity is one of the biggest things that allows us to break our
(10:21) beliefs because we have to we have no other choice and that's why when we have scripts and whatnot and the the show rates double based on the fact that you know you actually are going to leave a location and you're not going to be able to sell that person the tonality of how you're speaking to the prospect even though the words are the same the fact that it's just what you believe that changes the outcome and the influence on the other person is like so cool to me and so the question is like how can we trick ourselves into
(10:47) believing what we need to believe in order to grow faster i did this experiment you know three years ago where i put on like 35 pounds of muscle in six weeks right and i started and they asked me to write an article it's muscle and strength and i did it natural you can choose to believe me or not but i did it was 35 pounds of muscle but it was 35 pounds and there a lot of it was muscle um within six weeks and i started the article off by saying like what if you actually had to gain 35 pounds in six weeks and get and add 100 pounds to your
(11:13) your batch what would you do and so i tried to put this conf like these confines on myself and i was like i probably wouldn't just lift one you know twice a week right for that lift i'd probably lift it like once or twice a day and then that's what i did and then i got really really strong really fast i added a hundred pounds to my pitch in six weeks and i and i was natural right and i did that because of the confine like the confines that we put ourselves under and so sometimes i wonder like what things are we allowing to be spoken
(11:40) over ourselves by others first and then second what things are we speaking over ourselves that we don't even know that we're doing constantly questioning like those things that we speak over ourselves has been honestly one of the biggest things that has allowed us to grow i know that i haven't been as tactical in the last few content videos i hope you guys don't mind um it's just been what's on my mind um we had chris and rob and barnett who flew out here because they won a competition that we were holding in secret
(12:07) anyway so chris and robin barnett came out and they were like we feel like we're stuck right we feel like we're in a bottleneck and like we just can't we're just trying to break through and um when i talked to them about it i um the whole time they were here for the whole day i didn't tell them a single tactical thing to do differently with their business not one but what we identified was the things that they were speaking over themselves and the things that they were choosing to believe about how quickly things can
(12:34) happen right and so i'll give you an example i hope they don't mind robin his chris's wife didn't want to be in the gym anymore she's like it's not my passion you know like i kind of like now we're comfortable like i kind of want to do my own thing and so um and it was causing some strife in their relationship mostly because like you know she felt you know betrothed to him that she had to keep doing it but then he felt guilty that she know i mean there's just kind of both sides of it right um and so they were like well we're gonna
(13:00) let robin go you know she's gonna leave in four months right so we're gonna get four months um and then she'll get out of the business and i was like why didn't she just get out today like she doesn't want to do it you don't want her there like why don't you just get out today like why are you choosing to believe that it needs to take four months you know like i guess it doesn't it's like right and so a lot of times like i've just this has just been recently for me i've had a lot of conversations with guys who are
(13:27) doing five to 12 million a year in their businesses and a lot of them have been doing this a lot longer than me and they're like how have you freaking grown so if like how are you hitting the numbers you're hitting how is the growth rate that you guys are having like how is it possible right and like we've really just like i've tried not to be weird about this but like we've just chosen to believe it's possible we've really just chosen to believe it's possible and a lot of times like if you talk to them and it's
(13:53) like you see these guys who are really really really high up in the business world a lot of times they do talk very non-tactical very much mindset stuff and i think it's and i used to really not appreciate it but now i think i'm appreciating it a little bit more because the reason that a lot of people aren't successful is because of the beliefs that they have because if you can remove and break those beliefs a lot of times they will go find the tactics that are necessary right to win and the higher up you go the hot like the
(14:16) cleaner people keep their space and the reason they do that the reason they keep it so quiet is so that they can pinpoint anything that comes in their area right anything that's gonna break or ch chip at them or just like bother them in any way to keep this bubble around them and then what that does though is that it gives them such clean perspective and clean vision on what's going on because a lot of times when i have these guys like i said you were doing you know five six ten million a year and they're like
(14:44) what's going on it becomes really obvious it's really it's it's really apparent i'll give you another example i had yesterday i talked to a guy who's doing um he's doing half a million a month right now and he has it split between two businesses he's got one business that's like 400 000 a month he's got one that does a hundred thousand a month and he's like well the big you know the 400 000 month business is my old business um it's the one that it's it's got all the complexity in it i hate the customers all this stuff right
(15:12) and then he's like and then this business is really simple it's super profitable i'm running like three times the margin i run in that business and um and he's like so i just i just can't figure out how to grow and i was like do you really can't figure out how to grow he's like yeah just like i got so much stuff going on and i was like yeah you should probably just get rid of the thing that is a big headache for you and do the thing that you really like doing i was like do you think if you got rid of all of the attention that that 400
(15:39) 000 month thing is sucking up you'd be able to double the hundred thousand one thing he's like yeah like easy and i was like cool then why don't you do that right and it becomes really apparent and obvious to you on the outside like i mean these guys aren't dumb you know what i mean he's doing 6 million like he's not stupid it's just the beliefs that we truly believe are the ones that we don't see and so it's really interesting and like i think all the time about like i want to be wiser i want to have more discernment and if you
(16:07) really if you start to dissect like what is wisdom right wisdom is being able to see is that is if two people are looking at the same situation the wiser person sees things that the other person doesn't and so it's it's vision it's being able to see what other people don't see and a lot of times they're just unseen chains that people have already chosen to tie themselves up with right and we're having a lot of gemini's i've had just recently a string of gym owners stopping like man we're just stuck at 60 000 a month like
(16:36) i don't know what this bottleneck is and i always respond i'm like it's not the business model right it's you and it's and it's and i should probably respond more specifically it's a belief that you have that you haven't identified yet that's holding you back a lot of times it's just because you're choosing to make less money like no joke a lot of people choose to make less money so people like we have gym owners right now who are asking like hey like i've got this campaign it's crushing it i think i'm going to turn it off for
(17:03) next month right because like we have a lot going on i'm like if you want to choose to make less money that's your choice you know and so we make these choices if you if you were to articulate them differently you'd probably think they were ridiculous and i had every conversation i've had just in the last two weeks i've talked to four entrepreneurs the last two weeks that are doing five million or more per year and each one of the conversations ended with like well when you put it like that i sound like an idiot and i was like
(17:29) well are you it's like well no i was like then you should probably change the way you're doing it and so it's just these emotions and these beliefs that get in our way of like what seems so obvious and it's just because so we are emotional beings right we are we make decisions with emotions and we try and logic it later but when you look at things logically a lot of times some of the the answers are obvious well i've got this trainer that i've had for two years but they're such a pain they never want to do anything other than anything
(17:52) that's new but i have some clients that that still like them okay do you think that if you had a new trainer that was like bought in that you would be able to grow more so what it is is the fear of losing these few clients that are attached to this one trainer is outweighing the potential growth you would have from the key player that you know you need in order to make the model work and then when it's phrased that way it becomes obvious yeah i gotta let them go but you don't have the perspective yet until sometimes you just need someone on the
(18:18) outside but anyways guys um thank you for spending saturday morning with me this was just something that was on my mind and i just like it was like stirring in me but be mindful of the things that speak people speak over you and the tone that they do it and just like if you feel weird after someone says something stop the conversation catch it and then address it and be like please don't speak to me like that please don't say those things about me it really bothers me i'm really working on this or i've worked a lot on this and
(18:44) i don't i don't appreciate it it really bothers me and if that person cares about you they will change and if they don't get them out of your life you don't need that and the most important person to make sure that you're doing that which is you like if you're the one who's saying man i'm just not good at details man i'm just i'm just i hate employees good luck running a business these are things i overhear even in our group like ah employees are idiots i'm like do you really think that that is a good belief to grow and
(19:12) repeat inside of yourself if you want to grow and scale a business probably not right like be mindful of the things that you're saying because and then ask yourself like does this belief serve and if it doesn't get rid of it so anyways i hope you guys have an amazing weekend um i love you all thank you guys for for for giving me your attention i know it's your most valuable resource so thank you i hope i gave you a good return on it um and i hope you guys have an amazing amazing day all right lots of love bye

Why you should NEVER listen to your parents at any age... - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ikm8tTuA10Q

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video i'm going to talk to you about why you never should listen to your parents at any age hi my name is alex romozzi i own a portfolio of companies that has 85 million a year in revenue i make this channel because a lot of people are broken i don't want you to be one of them and so one of the things that happens and this is at any age like i know guys who are making millions of million dollars a year and still uh you know are insecure about what their parents tell them about xyz and so the reason i think this is interesting is
(00:22) that most people unless your parents are exorbitantly wealthy and have achieved everything that you wish to achieve i don't think you should listen to your parents and so one of my first rules of life is never listen to someone who's poorer than you or poor than you want to be all right so that's two different you know caveats there because you might be younger and it's like okay well yeah my parents have more money than me but like are they poorer than you want to be if so then only listen to people who are wealthier
(00:41) than you want to be right and the thing is is that they always will and other people too right will always side on the side of being less less risky right and here's why because when you naysay right it's like kind of like when you're um if someone's like oh i don't like your girlfriend and and the thing is is that if you date in general right and dating can apply like the concept of dating and apply to business concepts doesn't matter but if you date then fundamentally every single person that you date except for the one
(01:09) that you marry is going to be somebody who you're not going to be with and if someone says i don't think this person's good i don't think this person's good then they will be right literally 99 of the time except for the one time that matters right kind of interesting and so the thing is is most businesses fail 95 of businesses fail within five years right and so most times they are correct and so it's very easy for them to self-reinforce that they are so smart right and they're always right and they could tell you i
(01:34) told you so right but the reality is that they are wrong in the one percent of times that it matters right in your life and so when i think about this what's interesting is that like the only way that is guaranteed to knock you to success is to never take the risk to begin with right that's the guaranteed way of not achieving it and i remember when i was quitting my job that was the biggest conclusion that i came to was that i was not happy at my current earning level and that the only job because there was one position one job that made
(02:01) enough money that i wanted which was being an investment banker so the best investment bankers can make 10 20 million a year but i knew what it was required to get there in the amount of effort time and sacrifice and i was like the only people who will pay me that amount of money um will be making so much more money off of me and literally draining my life that i don't think it's because like usually if you become an investment banker successful you pretty much donate 20 years of your life in order to do that um and you're you're
(02:25) really never going to see your family and all that kind of stuff and for me that was not a trade-off i wanted to make it so i figured there was no job that was going to pay me what i wanted to make and afford me the lifestyle that i wanted and so the path that i was on was guaranteed to not get me to where i wanted to go and so even though it was micro risky it was macro the only way i could do it right and so that's one of those like one of those things actually like from garyvee that he says micro speed macro patience right
(02:53) money loves speed wealth lost time and so if we're trying to build wealth we're trying to build an asset right then we need to have time one of my other favorite things that i'll share with you is um uh you get paid for what you do you get returns while you own right and so anyways back to the back to the reason why you shouldn't listen to other people is that they don't have an accurate understanding of risk right and the biggest risk is not doing anything at all the biggest risk is never dating not that you're with this person right
(03:19) and so warren buffett said and i like this he said most people only need to make four or five really good decisions in their life so think about that for a second because i think about like that one really shook me because i think about all the decisions that i make every single day right and all the decisions that i've made in my life and there's really not that many of them that have been the biggest levers but the few that have been have been massive and enormous levers in my life and most people don't take enough time to think
(03:42) about those decisions that are the massive force in the road am i going to keep going in this position do i want to live in the city am i going to marry this girl who am i going to go to uh who am i going to get into business with uh what are we going to do right what are we actually going to do in this business and so people don't give put enough thought into that stuff and spend all their time thinking about what next show they're going to watch on netflix right rather than thinking like i'm going to take some time with this decision
(04:02) because one of my other sayings is mistakes love a rushed decision right so microspeed macro patience if you're looking at long playing long then you have to understand or at least this is my you know my two cents on it is that most people will oppose you at all times and that is because it is safer for them to do so because they will be right most of the times but on the one percent of times that they are wrong it's that one percent decision saying that you're going to buy seized candies for 25 million and ends up
(04:26) generating a billion dollars right in revenue it's that one decision that they're going to miss out on and that's the one decision that matters and so they are 99 of the time right but they're 100 wrong right and so that's the only message that i wanted to really drive home is that if you have parents who make less money than you want to make if you have friends who make less money than you want to make i had so many people who told me that everything i was doing was stupid i was giving up a really good consulting job to open a gym right i
(04:52) took all my savings and sunk into a business and you know what that business wasn't the one that set me free it was four four or five businesses from there but i learned the skills that one by one i was able to assemble and assemble on a belief standpoint of the world with the character traits to reinforce them to eventually yield the success that some people think is you know cool so anyways um i made this video because i've had um a lot of younger people who reached out to me recently about this particular
(05:14) issue and it's just understanding macro risk versus micro risk micro risk yes you will fail but failure is part of the game right but the macro risk is that you'll never actually succeed and that's the real game right and so you have to understand that you have to date in order to find the girl you're going to marry you have to go on a lot of bad dates you have to have a lot of small businesses that don't work right you don't have to but it's common and i don't know any entrepreneur who hasn't had a lot of businesses who eventually
(05:38) yielded success right or even a lot of businesses within their main business they pivoted a lot of times until they figured out what they were good at what the market needed i hope that makes sense to you i hope you found value this uh i'm rooting for you i'm your biggest fan keeping awesome keep taking risks microspeed macro patients and um you get paid for what you do you get returns on what you own and what we're trying to build here is an asset that can pay us over time because if we cannot learn how to build that asset we will work until
(06:02) the day we die so i'm keeping awesome much of love and i'll catch you guys in the next video hit subscribe if you like it and if you don't don't subscribe uh i'll get you soon alright but

The Biggest MYTH You Probably Still Believe - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFSiEDvXws

Transcript:
(00:00) I want to talk about a business myth that needs to die. It's something that so many business owners believe and so I'm going to explain what it is, how it's applied to thousands of businesses that have come to our headquarters here at acquisitioners.com in Vegas and how it's likely holding you back.
(00:16) And it's one of the most insidious beliefs, and I think it might be the one that ends the most businesses. And the crazy part is it has nothing to do with the business and everything to do about how you treat it. Now, I've had the same problem come up again and again and again that I felt the need to make this for you, which is my business isn't scalable or shouldn't I switch my business some to something that's more scalable? Again, I might gouge my own eyes out, but I the reason that I that I'm so annoyed by it is that
(00:43) basically every business has limits to scalability and there are different problems that occur at different times. Now, I want to talk about this within two different contexts. one is industry context and secondary is um more on like the demand and supply side. But I'm going to I'm going to break this down in a lot of different ways.
(01:01) So right off the bat, if you have a service business, for example, you hire humans to do things for other humans, then that is a business that's very easy to start, can be very profitable, and then over time can become a little bit more difficult, not impossible, just more difficult to scale quickly because maintaining quality of service when you have other humans doing things and you're bringing them in and they don't know anything and you have to train them becomes more challenging.
(01:24) If we had kind of like the middle of the path there, you've got like an e-commerce business, which you can start relatively quickly, but as you scale up, you can scale up quickly, but some of the issues become supply chain and logistical problems, right? So, I'd say that's kind of like in the middle, right? It's it's a little bit slower to start.
(01:38) It costs a little bit more money to start. It does scale faster than traditional service does, but you're still going to run into some problems. Now, all the way on the kind of extreme side, you've got the the software digital type businesses. Now these businesses um are typically when I say digital I mean SAS software not uh e like not not digital products like ebooks and courses things like that these businesses cost the most amount of time to start the most amount of money to start but once you achieve scale they become significantly easier relative to
(02:04) the others and so I get this question of like I don't think my business is that scalable all the time when in reality it's just harder to scale and so the thing is is that switching from one service business to another service business in terms of overall category is not likely to dramatically change your growth trajectory at all.
(02:20) You're still likely going to be constrained by humans, which most businesses are. I'm going to say this again. 78% of businesses in the United States are service-based businesses. Like, this is this is reality. And the reason that this is so annoying to me is that people will come and want to break their businesses.
(02:36) They won't want to abandon their businesses because they think that the woman in the red dress, they think this other new thing somehow doesn't have the same characteristics of a people-based business. Now within that category, let's say we have a service business. You can have demand constraint service businesses and supply constraint service businesses.
(02:52) Each business has problems. And the crazy part is is that the problems are actually kind of similar. So let me explain. So if you have a demand constraint service business, so you have a a a brickandmortar fitness business, you're going to be demand constrained as in it's going to be harder to find people want to work out than it is to find people who want to teach people to work out.
(03:10) Right? Finding trainers and fitness enthusiasts, not that hard. finding people who actually want to come in the gym and get excited and ser you know sign up for a service package or something like that much more difficult right on the flip side if you have an accounting firm right getting um getting getting people to do their accounting everyone kind of has to do their accounting but getting competent and highquality accountants uh becomes the issue now how do you solve each of those problems you promote fundamentally you promote to get new customers you promote
(03:37) to get new accountants it's the same problem you just have it on the back end of the business or the front end of the business. And some businesses have alternate between whether supply or demand constrained if you kind of grow at the same rate. So you'll alternate back and forth. But fundamentally, and this is why I think this is so important, you're going to struggle in one way or the other.
(03:56) And the way that you will solve it in either of those situations is going to be through promotion of some sort. And so the reason that I bring this up is that said differently, my business isn't scalable means it's hard and I want it to be easy. and can you just tell me that it's going to be easy? And it's not. And so difficulty is a feature, not a bug, of scaling a business.
(04:17) It is something that comes with scaling a business. And the the reason I think this is so important is that there are periods of time, and sometimes those periods are not weeks, but they are quarters, many quarters in a row, where you have to sit with a problem, as in you see the fire and it's in your living room, and you have to just let it burn.
(04:34) So let me explain what I mean by this. There will be problems that occur in the business. Let's say that you're, you know, you're supply constraint and you need to bring new people in. Okay. So, once you decide, okay, I can't handle more customers because I have to hire more accounts. I have to hire more HVAC people. I have to hire more technicians at my auto shop, whatever it is.
(04:50) As soon as you make that decision, you see that clearly, you start the promotional cycle. So, you start kicking off ads, you start doing some outreach, you start hitting up your network, and then you start some interviews, start some screening, and then maybe you find uh one or two people, and then you, you know, interview them.
(05:04) And then maybe you give them a job offer. And then once you give them a job offer, you have to get them trained up and be proficient. And you might lose some of them because they're not as good as you thought they were. And other ones are good, but it still takes three or six months for them to scale up.
(05:16) And so all of a sudden, now here, remember this what the feeling is going to be like. You decided and you realize that you were supply constrained. You went out and you did something about it. Good for you. But once you start going out and doing something about it, what happens? Nothing. The business is still constrained.
(05:30) And so you just suffer day in and day out while you try and solve this problem. And here's the nasty part. Let's say that six months from now. But remember, six months is 180 days of every day you wake up and you're like, I have this problem. I should do something about it. And then you have to remind yourself, I am doing something about it.
(05:45) But the thing is is that your team is still going to be struggling. They're still going to be complaining. You might still be complaining. And the thing is is your brain, your monkey brain is going to be like, we should do something about this. But you are doing something about it. It's just that the thing you're doing about it isn't going to solve it today.
(05:59) And the likelihood is that, and this is where this is where it gets nasty. This is where this is where the real problems happen. This is why this is such an important video. During that waiting period is when the vast majority of entrepreneurs [ __ ] with [ __ ] So they change their model. They change their price.
(06:13) They try they try and change they're like, you know what? Well, what if we change our deliverable to, you know, it's it's 20 people per account instead of 10 or five. And that way we could, you know, we can keep selling. But then all of a sudden your service delivery drops and your churn goes up and now you have a structural issue within the business.
(06:27) Whereas when you had your business that you had before this without changing it, you had good margins and good revenue retention. Meaning like you kept making money and people kept pay good. And so you take something that's really good and because you have a constraint on the system, you break the business while you're waiting for your solution that you already started on to kick in.
(06:45) And so this is where pain this is like this is the this is the tangible of pain tolerance. So a lot of people like to think about like the rocky cut scene and things like that like I'm in business. It's the grind. The grind is often times realizing there's a problem, beginning to try and solve it, and then having to live with that problem for not weeks or months, but quarters and sometimes years.
(07:05) Hey guys, real quick. If you're not sure if you actually have a a slow solve problem or a fast solve problem, like it's like, man, I just don't know how to solve this. We solve problems in businesses, you know, every day at acquisition.com. And my team looks at companies every single month.
(07:20) And if you'd like to have us take a look at the business, see like where the constraint might be and maybe how to uh to help, then you can click somewhere around this video and you can uh schedule a time to uh see if it's a good fit for you to come out cuz uh this is kind of what we do every day. And so we've gotten pretty good at it.
(07:34) And uh like I said, if that's valuable, click, book a call. If not, enjoy the rest of the video. And so the reason I'm bringing this up is that then the next thing that you start thinking is, well, you know what? Maybe I'll have I'll outsource this this problem to somebody else. I'm going to delegate this away. Sam Alman had this really good bit that I saw on Instagram the other day and he said he's the founder of OpenAI if you don't know who he is.
(07:53) He says you can't delegate the execution because the idea and even the product or service often times though exciting is not the hard part. That's like the 10% of the business. I mean it's fun. You have lots of iterations, lots of changing, but then once you have it and people are buying it and they like it and you make money at the end of the month, the 90% of everything else is the actual execution. It's the doingness.
(08:15) And then doing this is the part where you have unrelenting problems that either you are actively solving and have not seen the fruits of your labor or you're just solving the micro problems that happen every day. And all the while you have to resist the urge to break the thing that actually works that you spent all of this other time getting all these iterations getting punched in the face to find the thing that actually worked.
(08:34) And the likelihood that when you change the thing that actually works to something that's not that thing and that that other thing is going to work better than the first thing is low. And that's the crazy part. Think about this from a hypothetical perspective. If I have a building, right, I've got bricks all along each of the walls to create the building, right? There are unlimited places that those bricks could be in the physical world.
(08:53) They could be in China, you know, like I'm saying like if I had a,000 bricks, brick number 999 could be in its exact place where it needs to be for the building, or it could be in unlimited other places. But only in one of those locations is it serving the purpose of keeping the building upright. And so often times when we move bricks, what we're doing is the likelihood that the move that we have is going to take that brick from something that already works in the building to improving the strength of the building versus just being a Jenga block that we remove or we
(09:18) put on the side or we just put it across the street. And then we think that it's going to improve the building when in fact the likelihood that when we change something that works that it works better is usually significantly lower. And so I want to I want to dovetail into kind of a third bigger idea here which is features and bugs.
(09:31) And I referenced it a little bit earlier but I want I want to hit on it really hard. And to use the words of my great uh CFO Suzanne, she said, "All businesses have [ __ ] All businesses have features and bugs." But I think one of the big mistakes is that founders believe that the feature is a bug when it really isn't.
(09:48) And so if you have, let's say, a service business, then you're going to be like, "Man, it's hard to find good people. I should change my business model." Well, people's the business. That's a feature. That's something that comes standard with the business. You're never going to eliminate it. It's going to be part of it. If you were like, "Man, I am a software, you know, uh, company.
(10:04) " Then guess what? The problem that you're going to have is finding good software developer. They're really hard to find and they're really expensive and so you going to still have to manage those people. Now, of course, there are problems in business that you can solve. It's just that there's a lot of businesses that you manage rather than solve.
(10:19) You don't you never get through them. It's just like basically this pain of business that just it's just overhead. It's just something that you have to keep paying. And so like I I feel like this is so important because this is what understanding this took me a very long time and you must do the hard thing and a lot of the hard thing is basically withstanding the pain of knowing that there were mistakes being you know occurring in the business.
(10:41) There's churn that's going up and if we had these people we wouldn't have this churn but I can't change the business because I'm actively getting those people. So you just have to sit there and watch it burn. You have to be okay with the flaws and it will drive you insane because as a person you need to be the type of person who's not okay with flaws.
(10:58) But you have to be willing to deal with the flaws as they exist because you are already actively solving them. And you have to look at your team in the face and be like, "Yep, heard." And they're like, "We're doing there's all these fires." You're like, "Yep, understood. What are we going to do about it right now? We're already working on it.
(11:12) " Well, why isn't it done yet? It's in progress. What? What? It's in progress. Well, shouldn't we do this in the meantime? No. We're just going to continue. We're going to endure. We're going to persist. We're going to deal. And I think that season is the part that is the hard part. And the thing is is that season is literally never ending because as soon as you once once you you you find your mechanics, you find your accountants, you find the software developers who are going to help you with your business, whatever it is, right? As soon as you find those people,
(11:41) guess what happens? Something else will break. And you'll have some things that are fast fixes, and you'll fix those fast. But some fixes are slow fixes. And the slow fixes are the one that are going to be the vast majority of your business career. Because the fast fixes are only there for a small period of time because you deal with the pain, you see the you see the solution, and you solve it. Done. Over.
(12:01) But then as soon as you go fast, fast, fast, slow, then you just got to stick with that slow one until it's solved. This is what makes it hard. And it's not that your business isn't scalable. It's that you want scaling to be easier. And that's the issue. Your business isn't broken. You don't need to change the business.
(12:16) You need to deal with the fact that solutions take time and that this might just be a feature of the business you're in. Now, part of you might think, well, if this is a feature of the business that I'm in, uh, I don't want to have this business. Okay. Well, if let's walk through that.
(12:30) So, hypothetically, if you were very good at solving that problem, would that be a problem that you'd be more okay with dealing with? Maybe. And if you're considering an alternative path, you should also consider the alternative problems, right? You're like, "Well, I want to do something else." Okay, tell me all the things that suck about that path because I promise there are things that suck about that path.
(12:48) And then the FOB question of that is, are you better equipped to solve those problems? Now, in the hypothetical world, you always think you're better equipped to solve those problems, but often times you've never even solved them before. And maybe the problems you think that are there are not actually the real problems.
(13:02) The real problems are much deeper and more nefarious than the ones you currently deal with. And so, I think that there's some something so deep about the saying the devil, you know, right? is that like the business is the devil, you know, and you've maybe been doing this for a year or two years or five years or 10 years, however long you've been in your industry, 20 years.
(13:16) The thing is is the longer you've been in industry, the more you've mapped the the the system, right? You more you've mapped the terrain. You understand the good and you understand the bad and you understand what to do about the bad. And so, fundamentally, problems will not end.
(13:31) And I think this is like it's almost like a human problem that exists with entrepreneurs is that they want problems to stop and they will never stop. they will never stop. You're wishing for something that does not exist. And in so doing, you are consistently changing things about the business that is working. It's probably the same thing for people who hop from rel relationship to relationship is they want to think, I want to have I want to find a relationship that has no problems.
(13:51) It's not going to it's not going to happen. You're not going to find it. But the biggest problem is all of all is that you think that there shouldn't be problems. You have a problem with your problems and that problem is solvable. You decide that there isn't a problem with having problems. You accept that having problems is a fact of life.
(14:06) It's a fact of business. It's a fact of wherever you're trying to go. Like find me one $100 million, $10 million, million dollar, billion dollar entrepreneur who says, "I got here and there were no problems. In fact, today I have actually solved all of my problems." It doesn't happen. And so we have this demand. We have this wish.
(14:25) And that wish is the actual biggest problem in your business because it's the thing that's causing you to break the thing that's working. And this is where you need to give time time. You need to give solutions time to breathe. And you need to give solutions time to work. And as always, once the solution actually happens, play it out.
(14:38) Let's say that we've got we finally fixed our accounting our accounting recruiting problems. We now have lots of accountants. We created a whole school for accounting. We made 20 partnerships with different accounting schools. And now we have this we have guys banging down the door being like, "Man, I would love to work for you.
(14:52) What's your problem now?" Well, you know what? Now that I've got all these accountants, I've got all these guys with empty empty calendars. They could I have so much more capacity. I'm I'm overpaying in payroll because I got all these guys, but I need to get more customers. And so what do you do? You start marketing more, but now but now the customers are coming in because you're trying to fill slots. You're you're lowering your bar.
(15:10) You're taking worse quality customers. Now your churn becomes an issue, right? And your margins start going down because you can't charge these people as much and you've already taken on more fixed costs because you started hiring all these people. Huh? Is this sounding familiar? These are sounding like business problems.
(15:24) Because wouldn't it be convenient if that accountant would say, "Hey, uh, I will wait here patiently until you have acquired 20 accounts of appropriate size and then and only then will I choose to come on board." And at that moment, you can collect their revenue and all of these customers will say, "You know what? I will I will wait in line until you get 19 more customers just like me.
(15:42) And then all at once, we will start working with this new account that you're bringing in so that your payroll and your revenue can match." Wouldn't that be nice? It'd also be nice if this table was made of gold or diamonds. be sweeter if it were diamond or adamantium, even cooler, but very unlikely.
(15:58) And so, if you want to be in the wishing game, then maybe entrepreneurship isn't the right path for you. But if you want to live in the real world, you have to accept that there will be problems and there will be things and they they typically revolve around one core issue, which is the delta between your expectations around time.
(16:14) So, let me explain what I mean by this probably fourth concept. The problem isn't your expectations of the business. Your problem is the timeline of those expectations. If you want to change the world, you absolutely can. I believe that wholeheartedly. I think any one person, any one man, any one woman can change the world. I believe that. But not tomorrow.
(16:32) It will probably take time. It will take infrastructure. It will take help. It will take a movement. It will take many other people helping you along the way. And that does not happen overnight. Like there's the saying, Rome wasn't built in the dead. And it's true. It wasn't. And so now I'll give you a realistic timeline. think um I I work on which is I work in decades and the reason I choose that number is that you can go from new idea to massive global company in about 10 years.
(17:01) You look at a zero to a Microsoft which they IPOed at about seven years, right? You look at like obviously OpenAI's like we saw their very rapid growth but they're also they worked since like 2017 and now they're what like eight years in. So again, 7 years, 6 years, I I round a little higher because, you know, I don't think I'm I'm Elon Musk.
(17:21) And maybe you don't think you are either. And if you're politically charged about it, pick a different entrepreneur, whatever. The point is the rush you have is imaginary. It's not real. It's in your head. You've made it up. To get to where, by, when, why, like, why? Like, we have to double this year. Why? Maybe the fact that you think you have to double this year is the reason you'll never double over the next five years because you keep trying to cut corners. You can't build it right.
(17:43) And because you don't build it right, you don't get the right people in on the front end. You don't get pe right people in the back end. You get the wrong talent. You get the wrong customers. You keep turnurning this up because of arbitrary arbitrary completely made up lines that you draw in the sand and say this must occur.
(17:57) And so I think if you you can have the business you want, just not by the time that you want it. And so I don't think you need to change your dreams. I think you need to change your timelines. And so the idea that your business isn't scalable is actually yet again in relation to speed. Of course, it's scalable. It's just not as scalable.
(18:13) It doesn't scale as fast as you'd like it to. And what part of this can we change? The as you'd like it to. That part you can change. Now, of course, you could advertise more. You could try and hire a bigger recruiting team within the constraints of your business given the resources you have. Sure, of course you can allocate more resources, but you're not going to solve it. These are features.
(18:28) And so, I think a lot of people are wishing for a business that has no difficulty. And if you find it, let me know. But I've yet to see it. And I've looked at a lot of businesses and so I say this because many of you probably one don't need to change your business. Probably need to keep doing the business you're on. Number two, the business you're on is probably scalable.
(18:45) All businesses are scalable. It's just how hard is it to scale? And when we translate hard into what problems must I solve in order to scale it? And what are the alternative problems to this path that I would have to encounter if I didn't follow this path? Which you'll find are often also equally difficult.
(18:59) And probably you're less equipped to solve them because you've never solved them before. And so the idea is I want no problem. But really, you're only trading problems. And so, when you're thinking about, I want this to not be this way. Think about what what problems you'd rather have. There's a big big big big pile of problems in the middle of the table.
(19:13) All the business owners are tossing them in uh in the middle. And it's like you got to throw your cards in, your problems in, you got to pick somebody else's. When you look at everybody else's, like, ah, I don't know. I don't know if I would pick them up. And the thing is, the longer you deal with your problems, the better you get at dealing with them.
(19:28) Kind of like the longer you've dated somebody, you're like, I kind of know how to deal with this person. I know how to deal with their crazy, right? And over time, they kind of know how to deal with your crazy, right? So, your business probably isn't broken. It's probably just not growing as fast as you want because you are demanding that it grow faster, but you are in so doing trying to break things about your business that were making it work in order to get it to not work so that you no longer have that problem and you
(19:50) create another problem. And now you have two problems to solve, which is harder than one. Your timelines are the biggest issue in the business. And the fact that it is hard is a feature, not a bug. And the vast majority of your business career will be spent waiting in painful tolerance of the solutions that you are implementing to kick in.
(20:08) And you have to deal with the lashings of life while that's happening and look at everyone in the team in the eyes and say we are working on it. And they're going to be like, well, why don't we change this? And you have to look at them and say, no. And they're going to say, but there's this fire. And you're like, "Yeah, but if we do your thing, then we're going to have another fire and we're also going to incur the cost of change between both scenarios, which I would rather just have pain one rather than pain two and cost of change pain,
(20:30) pain three." And so what it is, it's erratic. It's frenetic energy. It's the feeling like you must do something. And if you do, if you do have that energy and you're like, man, I got to do something about it. Go to what you're actually trying to do with the solution and try and promote yourself. Go do take some of the interviews yourself.
(20:45) Try and speed up the cycles there. By all means, try and speed it up. You're just not going to eliminate it. These will be features. These will be things that you live with. And I'll leave you with one thought. There's an old There's an old saying, an old bull and a young bull. And they see a bunch of, you know, pretty cows at the bottom of a bottom of a hill.
(21:00) And so the young bull is looking at the old bull and he's like, "Hey, let's chase let's go run down there and uh and see if we can catch one to um procreate with." And uh the old bull's like, "No, that's a terrible idea." And he's like, "Why?" He's like, "Well, because if we charge down there, he's like, "They're all going to scatter." And the young bull's like, "Yeah, but I'm going to I'm going to take this.
(21:17) you know, we'll each get one. He's like, "Yeah, but if if we walk down the hill slowly," he's like, "We can procreate with them all." Now, how does this relate to the business? Does this mean that if I take my time, I can pursue every single entrepreneurial endeavor? I actually think that within the context of entrepreneurship, it's backwards.
(21:32) You're never going to sleep with all the women. You can't. There are so many businesses that exist. And the reason for that, and you have more ideas than you have time. And I think that there is a there's a there's a fixed cost that we must accept that it will likely take if you really want to go big.
(21:46) It's going to like look at the biggest businesses. They're 20, 30, 40 years old and you're like, "Well, I'm I'm 30 now." It's like, "Right, that means until you're 70." One thing you just keep growing. And so, what does that what does that mean downstream? It means that there are opportunities, not just some opportunities, but all other opportunities besides the one that you're currently working on, you will have to say no to.
(22:10) Think about that reality like let it settle with you because you have to come to peace with it. And the fact that you haven't come to peace with it is why you keep wanting to pursue all of these things. But by pursuing all of them, you will get none of them. You can't sleep with all the women in the world.
(22:23) Doesn't matter what your what your what your novelty desire is. Like you have to understand that this is fact of life. You're not going to start every business. You're not even going to start every great idea you have. You're not even going to start what 20% of the great ideas you have, 10%, 5%, one out of 20, one out of a 100red.
(22:39) You're gonna have one idea and then you're going to have to keep sticking with it because that's where all the gains come in. It comes in the compounding. It comes in the sticking with it. Right? The hard part about the plan isn't thinking about the plan or doing the plan. It's sticking with the plan. That's the hard part of the plan. And believe me, and the frustration that I'm having, the reason I'm like almost shouting like this is because I'm shouting at me. I'm not shouting at you.
(22:59) I'm shouting at me because it's so hard. Like this is what's hard. It's the hard because it's a muscle you're not used to. It's a skill that you have to learn. You have it's a trait you have to flex over and over and over again. And I will say this, the more you say no, the better you get at it.
(23:12) It never goes away how hard it is. It just gets a little bit easier. Just gets a little bit easier with time. And eventually, I think you'll know that you will have appropriately flexed that muscle when you can have no FOMO. If you can hear that someone else is doing great and be like, "That's amazing for them. I know my game.
(23:29) I've been doing this for six years. I've been doing this for eight years. I'm going to keep doing my game." And I think a lot of it is that we have this desire for permanence. We have this desire for legacy. We have this desire to to live forever. When outside of Brian Johnson, no one else is really talking about that.
(23:43) And up until this point, the death rate on humans is 100%. And the forget the likelihood of forgetting of a a human's life is also close to 100%. And of the people who are remembered, they're not remembered by the people they know. They're remembered by people they don't know. And by the way, they're dead.
(23:57) And so, we have this desire. And I think it just comes into direct conflict with the idea that we just live finite lives. Time moves faster than you think. And the younger you are, the less you realize that the older you are, the more you start going like, "Man, that was pretty quick." You only have a couple a couple big bullets in it.
(24:12) You got a couple decades, you know, or couples, too. So, a few got three, four, maybe seasons. And if you really want to go big and something starts working, then you're going to do that thing for 30 or 40 years. And so, like the idea of like, oh, I'm going to own all these like you have divisions within a business if it makes sense.
(24:27) But most of the time, it doesn't. Most of the time, you could start this other thing or you could just do more of the thing that's already working. Why is it happening faster? because you're demanding that it happen faster. But there's nothing wrong with your inherent business. You're saying the problem is a problem that you created.
(24:39) Basically, you just take reality, you move the line of expectations, and then you say there's a problem. And I see more businesses ruined because of that than just about anything else. You could make it work if you just stuck with it. And you stop thinking that there's something wrong with your business.
(24:51) And maybe look at the fact there might be something wrong with your expectation. That's what I got. That's my That's my Thursday th Thursday thirst trap sermon. Thurman, if you like this video, uh, I made a video about figuring out whether your business is supply or demand constrained. If you're like, I don't know which one it is.
(25:07) Um, and you can go check that out around my head somewhere.

(00:00) $600 million a year in meat. That's how much Mike Salguro, the founder and CEO of ButcherBox, sends out every single year. And we had him fly out here to Vegas so that we could bring this to you, breaking it down into the tactics of what he did to start and continue to scale and things that any business owner can use today to scale their businesses. Enjoy. Before you had Butcher Box, you had another uh business.
(00:25) Do you want to do a quick like how we got here and some of the lessons you learned from that business, the failure? I love I love hearing about failures. Yeah. So, I I mean I could talk about a tremendous amount of failure in between college and my first business, but if if we want to go there, but my first business was a comp
(00:44) any called custommade.com. And uh my best friend uh Seth and I bought the company. Um we uh had approached a guy to sell us custommade.com for $140,000. Um, we didn't have any money at the time, so we gave him a check for $2,500 for a deposit and then had 90 days of due diligence, which is where you're supposed to figure out what happens at the company. And we took all that time to go raise money.
(01:05) Um, and so we raised 500 grand. And the whole Oh, okay. Yeah. The whole the whole thing was we were both working in real estate and we called it a shack in Manhattan. So this is 2008. Uh, custommade.com got a ton of inbound traffic. Yeah.
(01:24) from typing in customade and it was filled with woodworkers who had uh their projects and stuff on there. And when you talk to these woodworkers that are like, I get all my money from custommade.com and I pay $35 a year for my subscription and they had to like email the owner to like upload their content. So, we were like, "This is like a shack in Manhattan. We're just going to buy it. We're going to like overhaul it." Yeah. Turn it in they can log in and manage their own content and jack up the rents.
(01:47) sense. Um, so people, you know, thought that was a good idea and gave us also a great narrative for raising money as a side note, just even like as a shack in my hand. Like everyone's like, "Okay, go." Yeah. Yeah. Uh, of course, this was 2008 and in Boston in real estate and everyone had just lost their money cuz Bernie made off just ran off with everyone's money. Did something happen in 2008? Uh, United States. Yeah.
(02:10) I don't know why. Okay. Crazy. Yeah. So, uh, Bernie Maidoff ran off with everyone's money. We heard a lot of nos, but we cobbled together a round. Um, and then we got going and things were working and we raised another $500,000. Okay. And then when you say things were working, what did you mean? So, like you were starting to make more like you were able to grow the revenue of the business. Yeah, we so we had pivoted the website. You could now log in.
(02:29) We made a ton of mistakes, but we built a sales team. We had people calling to get makers to sign up for like an annual subscription or a monthly subscription. We hit about $60,000 in revenue a month. And what was it doing prior? Uh, $35,000 a year. Oh geez. Okay. So you c I mean you did an amazing job. Yeah. Yeah. U but we were still losing a little bit of money and and whatnot.
(02:52) Also a great frame for me was listening to this is the um the idea that like um I had a mentor say this. He's like right before you go to take your business to market. He's like switch sides of the table and then try and say like you just bought your business today. What are all the things you'd fix about it? It's like well maybe just do those first.
(03:10) And so I think it's just a great like perspective on any business is like if I bought everything today, how would I it's like a different lens at least. Anyways, for me it's been helpful. But please continue. Yeah. So um at the time it was like 2010 2011 everybody in tech was raising money. Mhm.
(03:29) And so we were looking at Techrunch and looking at all this stuff and at that time there weren't like all these accelerator programs and all these things that now are exist to help people. Um and so my co-founder and I looked at each other we're like we have a good business. why don't we raise money? Um and so we ran around town again raising money this time trying to raise from VCs and um we got First Round Capital, which is a very well-known VC in New York.
(03:55) And then we got Google Ventures to invest in our company at a uh it was a they we raised 1.9 million at like a 7 million. Okay. Pre- money. Sure. Um that's where things started like falling apart. So actually most people told us no. We went to raise money and people are like woodworker listing site like hell no and I was in uh I was in a meeting um and at at this VC benchmark and I said um I was like we built this this function this function where somebody could post a project and makers could see them coming in and then they could bid on them. Mhm. And I was like, "Pull up the job board." And this thing was like live action. We wanted to make it
(04:35) exciting. And there were like these jobs rolling in custom coffee table, custom I was like, "All we have to do is stand in between these transactions and we'll be the largest marketplace for custom stuff." Yeah. It's 2011. As soon as I said the word marketplace, everyone wanted an interview.
(04:53) We went from no no no to like marketplace, you could be the next Airbnb. And we're like, "Yeah, you bet. Yeah, sure. We can be whatever you want. Just give us some money." Yeah. Uh, and so we raised the money on the premise that we were going to create a marketplace and stand in between a custom transaction, which wasn't the best premise, but people loved it. Yeah. We raised 1.9.
(05:14) 6 months later, there was one VC that we left out of the first deal. Okay. We're like, we don't want to raise more than 1.9, so you can't participate. Six months later, they're like, we'll give you four on 16. We're like, okay, we'll take more money. So, we took four. Uh, and then we did an 18.
(05:32) So now you've diluted cuz now you're at cuz you had the 1.9 on seven. So you're that was 20 or 2% something like that, right? I don't know the math somewhere in there. Uh, and then you did another quarter so 25%. Y uh with the second round. So you're you guys are sitting a little bit above 50. Yep. Uh, at that point just from the two rounds. Yeah. Well, and then we're giving out equity to all of our employees and all that stuff, too.
(05:54) I'm highlighting this because I I I know I think I have some perspective on where you go. There's a different There's a different path. Yeah. So, and then a few years later, we did a $10 million round on $30 million. Um, it was actually $18 million. It was 10 of equity, four of debt, and four of secondary. Um, okay.
(06:12) So, you got some money off the table. So, we got some money off the table. You were like reading the tea leaves and you're like, you know, there's no way we're going to make anything. Yeah. We got all of our in all of our original investors got 3x their money if they wanted it. Many cash out. My mother did not. She's like, "I believe in you." Yeah. Maybe you should cash out, Mom. But okay.
(06:30) She like, "I took secondary work." Yeah. Like I I sold. Uh, so um, by the end of it, I mean, what what really happened at the company, the big lesson I learned is um, so Google uh, they have like incredible services for entrepreneurs. So if you're an entrepreneur and they invest in you, they can help you with a whole bunch of stuff.
(06:56) you want to like manage your AdWords account, it's like go talk to the people that run AdWords. And by the way, here are some gift cards and like they do all sorts of stuff to help you. Yeah. They're like, "Do you want us to come and look at your website and like get under the hood of your technology?" And we're like, "Yeah, of course, Google. Come on in.
(07:14) " And I I mean, literally the guy did this like week-long deep dive, came out, and was like, "That's the worst website I've ever seen." He's like, "I can't believe we invested in this." Like so our investors up here, how does this even make money? How is this like and these guys like Yeah.
(07:32) And so what ended up happening over the course so immediately we were like we have the wrong tech team that our investors were like you have the wrong tech team. You have to get rid of them. Yeah. So we got rid of our tech team and then it was like you have the wrong product people and then you have to get rid of the product people. You have the wrong marketing people.
(07:44) And what ended up happening over the course of about a year is I took all of the people who helped me build this company to help help me like hack through the jungle to get to like the road and we fired all of them. Yeah. And as one does as and I was left with a company of um new hires new hires people that didn't fit the culture. I hadn't written down the cultural values. Yeah.
(08:11) And I just have this vivid memory of um sitting in my car in the parking lot being like I I can't go in. Like I can't I don't even want to go to work. Yeah. And I had like a good salary, but by that point with all the delution I owned like 8% of the thing which I could go get a CEO job doing something.
(08:28) It was just like this like what have I done? Yeah. And I I I let go of all my friends. It was it was bad. Yeah. How many years was this? Uh eight years of working on it. Eight years. 2015 or sorry 2008 through 2015. So we just we covered eight years in a pretty short short little window just for anyone who's listening.
(08:50) And I bring this up just cuz like I feel like when when you when you hear the stories or you watch the the literally the 60-second short about someone's career, um it always, you know, you l you see the highlights and the low lightss, but a lot of it is just kind of like the mundane middle of just dealing with the stress of every day.
(09:07) There's always fires and there's a per a permeating level of baseline stress that doesn't really go away. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And so I mean one big lesson was like don't listen to investors when I when I started Butcher Box which we'll get into. I didn't want to take investment. There was also like I lost myself. I lost my team and I lost myself.
(09:29) And when I looked at the shambles that happened um was like I don't want to Did you shut it down? Yeah. So, we um we actually foreclosed on it because we had some venture debt. There was a little bit of debt. Our bank account got below we owed and they were like, "We we're we're taking it." So, we actually did a what's called a friendly foreclosure. They took it over.
(09:47) My co-founder stayed and it's still running it. Oh, it's still going. Yeah. Is it doing okay? It It's now a jewelry company and it's just they just do everything. There's no maker. There's no like no marketplace. The big problem that we had was you can't like these custom if you want a custom coffee table or a custom piece of jewelry.
(10:05) There's like 60 back and forths to like talk about every detail like and we had to stand in between that in order to get our fee which was like 10%. Which is a nightmare. It was a bad business. Yeah. But we because we sold everyone on marketplace when we were like this isn't going to work.
(10:23) People are like well that's what I invested in so you you need to keep going. So doing the other version of so because so I think about this sometimes as like the path not taken. So if you had if you had not raised really any of the money besides the amount that you needed to kind of acquire the business. So at that point, what did you raise the five what did you raise the $500,000 when you did that? You didn't go through the due diligence that period where you raised the 500.
(10:43) What was the what was the or how much equity did you give away for that? It was a convertible. So it converted into the the next round like a safe round. Yeah. Oh, great. Okay. So that ended up being like five or six I mean well a little more than that. So like 7% of the business. Yeah.
(11:02) um which would have been pretty a pretty good a pretty good move effectively. Yeah. And if that business at the time said it was doing $60,000 a month, right? So 720 a yearish in terms of run rate. Y if you had stuck with the original model Mhm. and just been like I'm not I don't have to pursue this not as an insult but like cockamini uh business model basically Billy or bust business model is what I mean to say. Um, it probably could have just been a very profitable.
(11:26) I mean, going from $35,000 a year to $60,000 a month in like 12 months is is is great growth. And was it was it profitable at that point? It was almost profitable. You could have made it if you wanted. We could have been profitable and that's one of the reasons why like I want to be here today and I like talking to people like you who talk to entrepreneurs about a different path than raising a bunch of money, diluting yourself, having people who tell you what to do and losing your culture in the meantime and losing
(11:50) yourself. Every business I've had has been bootstrapped that I've so I get it. Yeah. So when I started Butcher Box and so I took the we we closed the business. We let go of 50 people. Yeah. Uh shut the doors. I literally closed the gate and put the lock on and then your partner's like I'm still here though and we're still going to keep we're going to make Yeah. They like spun it out.
(12:09) And are you guys still friends? Yeah, we are. Oh, good. That's cool. Yeah. Uh it was a it was a little rocky for a couple years but uh yeah, we're good friends. Um I took the weekend off. It was Memorial Day weekend, so it was a long weekend. Um, and then I started Butcher Box, okay, on Tuesday.
(12:28) And, uh, I I had known in the final year at Custom Aid, it was very clear to me that we were going to hit a wall and there was like no stopping it. My co-founder had become CEO in that last year because there was he he just like loved the distressed he wanted to be the What was revenue then? Uh, so we we would only talk about GMV because because it was platform.
(12:48) So, our GMV I think got to like 3 or 4 million a month. Okay. Uh but you know, then we took a a 10% but actually because of I forget all the reasons it was like 7%. Yeah. Um so like 200 200,000 200,000 a month. Uh we at our height were burning 500,000 a month. That is Yeah. Healthy burn. Yeah. Healthy, right? Just like never say anything like it.
(13:19) like yeah there's a down just a road quote from uh Reed Hoffman I think he was talking to Elon or Peter Seal or something and he there they were on this the roof of of the building that they were at for PayPal and he said if we were one at a time lighting $100 bills and pulling them off the building he said it wouldn't be as fast as we're actually burning money in this company and like I just saw that was such a visual of like I could burn $100 bills slower than we're actually burning the money in this business, which I thought was hilarious. Yeah. No, it's wild. I mean, you start adding a bunch of people and then you add managers to manage
(13:50) those people and then you do a bunch of marketing and all of a sudden you're just like losing losing money. And when you raise, especially when you raise something like a $18 million round, they want you to spend the money as fast as possible.
(14:09) And the thing the thing that they don't talk about with venture is venture capitalists get paid when they put money out on the street. They take a management fee. And so um they have everyone around the table has the incentive to like put as much money as humanly possible into these deals. And so you really when you go like people are like how do I figure out what my valuation is? It's like no no just tell them how much money you can spend over the next 18 to 24 months and just argue for a bigger number. We're like we can blow through 10 million. They're like great here's a check.
(14:37) So um yeah it was uh which is counter to how like business works as a side note. So just so it's interesting because you're actually it's it's the collision of two different business models and the one who has the voting rights is the one who wins. Um but like their business model is deployment of capital and management fees by and large.
(14:54) Obviously there's carries and things like that but um there's that component and then there's the business model of the actual business but the person who actually calls the shots is the the the largest business the person who makes the most money from the business prevails in terms of um who has leverage in in the conversation. Yeah. And we had all the rights. So we negotiated really really well.
(15:11) We had all the rights in our documents. U my my co-founder Seth was just like a phenom at that. So they couldn't overthrow us. They didn't have any management decisions etc. But it doesn't matter like at the end of the day when they're like you're going to be black balled if you don't like the pressure, you know.
(15:29) Um so at the end it was like we're going to sell the company, we're going to bring in a different CEO, we're going to do all these things. None of which worked. Yeah. Um, I knew the writing was on the wall and so I'd been playing around with like a like what am I going to do next? And I had a few ideas. Um, I had a billboard company I was really interested in starting.
(15:49) I had a bond company I was really interesting in starting and I had this like shipping meat in the mail. Interesting. Um, and uh, the quick backstory, uh, my wife has an autoimmune uh, disorder. We were following these elimination diets to like clean up our diet. We were trying to find grass-fed beef. Couldn't find it. Huh. Okay. Um and I just got obsessed with like where do you find grass-fed beef? Yeah. And why is this a hard thing to find? Yeah.
(16:12) Why is this hard to find? And I ended up like meeting a farmer in a parking lot and buying trash bags full of meat and being like this is weird. Um and I started selling steaks to my buddies because I it was like too much meat. Yeah. And one of my buddies was like, "This would be so much easier if it was delivered to my house." Yeah. I don't want to like meet you at your house to pick up the the meat in a like just ship it to my house.
(16:29) And so I was like, "Okay, how do you ship meat in the mail?" Yeah. I couldn't figure it out. This is all while I was like still at Custom Made. Um and then I met This is while you were at Custom Mate. Well, it was like at the tail end. You were having an affair. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Uh things were closing down.
(16:49) Um then I reached out to the former head of operations of Omaha Stakes, which at the time was like the big meet the mail company. And he's like, "Yeah, like I my non-competes over." Oh, great. Uh I can help you. That's amazing. And so he made all these introductions. Yeah. Pro tip right here just for everyone listening. Uh find the person who has built the business. Yes.
(17:08) Uh already like it's you know um from an entrepreneur perspective I think in the beginning is always about how like all you know you're very tactic obsessed and obviously I talk a lot a lot about tactic stuff on this channel but um I say beyond a certain point it just becomes a lot about who because the leverage is in not having to live the 15 or 20 years or however long this guy had been in the in the stake business. You're like, you can either like relive his life and then be 20 years older.
(17:31) It's like or you can just find that guy and then he doesn't have to live your life either and then you combine and everybody wins. And so I think in the earlier stages of my career, I I I thought way more what and how than who. Yeah.
(17:49) Um also the way that I structured it, so I had a whiteboard, I had the three ideas and I had like the kill shot like the thing that if I didn't figure out this week or this month, like it you don't have a business. So, for the bomb thing, it was like a legal thing. And for the um for for Butcher Box, it was like, "How do you ship this?" Yeah. And so, I actually like every time I went to the bathroom, I'd be like, "All right, how do you ship me?" You know, like reaching out to people, trying to get somebody to to help. He finally said yes.
(18:13) Um and so fast forward to close the doors at ButcherBox or sorry, at uh Customade and it was pretty clear that like why don't I just like spend the summer messing around with this idea? Mhm. So, my intention was to build a hobby business. Like, I was I was very enamored by like Tim Farah's 4-hour work week.
(18:36) Like, you know, build something that runs in the background and then you can go live your life, you know, uh passive income. Um, and uh that was like I I thought if we had a thousand subscribers and we made a $20 profit on each subscriber, it's $20,000. you. So if you customer service, if you outsource that and if you build tech easy, like you could have like $10,000 a month.
(19:00) Um and so I built it was like WordPress on top of Stripe, which nowadays there's Shopify, which is incredible, but like WordPress on top of Stripe, which um uh we basically ran with until last year when we moved to Shopify. And then we outsourced everything and it was like, okay, this is going to be a hobby business.
(19:20) And the first thing I did, so I I had I had an intern start with me on like I want to pause us on something because I think it's such an important thing. So like I have I have had such a similar experience to I think the what you just walked through from a narrative perspective, which is that every time I've tried to like build a business, it doesn't work for me. It hasn't.
(19:38) And I've failed a bunch of times on businesses that I was like, I'm building a business. when I was like, how do I make some money that doesn't take a ton of my time? I end up building a really good business. Yeah. And so, it's just like an again, it's these like these these frames of questions and I think this at any level you could ask it from a product line perspective or a new division perspective, but it's it's like I have I've had these like romantic ideas of like this big thing that I want to have happen rather than
(20:02) like, you know, I just I just want to make some money in a really easy way. And then when what's interesting though is that you're basically sol I call it solving for zero which is like how do I solve for like no time and profit. But when you solve that problem when you have no time and profit it also scales a lot easier because you already started with the premise of how do I have it put no time not be as risky and be profitable. Sorry, pick back up. Yeah. No, that's right. Um if you build something to be a hobby, it can remain a
(20:32) hobby. Um and I could I'll talk about our backbone now, but it's it's very similar. Everything is third party. Um we have really tight specs on everything. But we took the perspective uh that um I start I started with I want a hobby and nowadays I took the perspective of like we're not going to learn how to ship boxes better than a a company that's been in the business for 75 years.
(20:59) Like why bother trying to do that? So anyway, we started with an intern uh and we decided that we were going to do a Kickstarter campaign. Okay. Or is Kickstarter or Indiegogo at the time? Yeah, this is 2015. Also, different way of raising money, by the way, for everyone who's listening. Pre-sales, though. Yeah. So, it's not raising money. You're just selling your product and you're seeing if there's a market and you're getting money up front.
(21:20) Every one of my So, my first gym, I saved all my money to start as soon as I and I and I wanted to start the gym as fast as humanly possible because I thought if I started the gym really quickly, then I could start making money. every gym after that gym, I had multi-month pre-sales that would pay for the that would finance the entirety of the gym off of people pre-bying memberships and pre- buying weight loss challenges and things.
(21:41) And so, like, this is definitely like a 101 to 2011 entrepreneur. Like, the first one, you know, you're you're taking the outside capital. You're like, you know, I'll bet you I could just get my customers Yeah. to just pay on different payment terms and just get and then it's also also a great uh product market fit test. If no one wants to buy your pre-sale, then thank god you didn't like raise money for it or something like that.
(21:58) as like we actually know people want to buy it and they're willing to pay for it and wait. Yep. Exactly. That's the great thing about Kickstarter is people are used to waiting a really long time um to get their products. Uh and and you know, we basically started we we hadn't launched yet, but we went out and showed our page to people.
(22:16) And the first thing that we learned was people were like, "I don't need that much beef. We only have grass-fed beef." Right. We're trying to sell people 8 to10 pounds of grass-fed beef for $129. People are like, "I don't need that much beef. I would never buy this." Yeah. And we're like, "Well, what if we put in chicken and pork as well?" They're like, "Oh, totally.
(22:33) Can you make it at the same standard? Like, can you find chicken that's like raised better and pork that's raised better?" And we're like, "Yeah, to." So, we we started with a box uh beef chicken or pork and launched our Kickstarter. And I think one of the, you know, one of the things that we've done well as a company is found arbitrage opportunities. Yeah.
(22:51) Yeah. And so, the first arbitrage opportunity was with Kickstarter. Okay. Um, so back in 2015, Kickstarter had this verified badge. Mhm. Like if if it would be like Kickstarter verified. Mh. And so what we did is we watched uh these campaigns and to see like which campaigns got the verified badge and then tried to reverse engineer like how did they get the verified badge and it was one part early momentum, you know, sales coming in. I tried to reach out to all the founders and be like, oh, we're doing this thing.
(23:21) I did whatever it took. Um, and so we went out to raise 25,000 in pre or in sales. Preed, right? And, uh, we ended up raising we ended up selling 40,000 in boxes in the first day. Oh, jeez. And then we got the Kickstarter verified badge. And then we ended up doing 210,000 in pre-sales. Yeah. Which was,00 of uh, meat. Yeah.
(23:46) um going, you know, the first the beauty of Kickstarter is if you get that verified badge, it's no longer uh you're no longer just asking your friends and your audience to shop. It like goes to every push it out. Yeah. And so it was a lot of random people we didn't know. So um and my whole idea because I wanted a hobby business and I didn't want to raise money. What benefit? Just I want to double click on the offer real quick. Offer is part of what we talk about.
(24:12) So what ancillary benefits or bonuses did you give to people beyond just the boxing? Was there anything else that they got for being, you know, early participant? Yeah, good one. Uh, so, uh, we offered the the way that you do with Kickstarter is, um, you try to activate the people who have bought to like go be your ambassadors.
(24:32) So, we said if we hit $100,000 in sales, we'll get give everyone free bacon in their first box. Okay. Yeah. And that like people went crazy. They're like, "I want the bacon." You know, and started like promoting it, putting it on their Facebook pages, all of that. Okay. That was it though. That was the offer. Our product, she had a referral bonus. Yeah. Really interesting.
(24:52) Um, our product was really hard is still really hard to find. Yeah. So, we're dealing with people who like want to eat healthier, feel guilty about the meat that they're eating, and we give them an answer to that. And so, there was it was really clear that we had struck a nerve really quickly. Yeah.
(25:10) Um, and so then during the Kickstarter campaign, so we signed up like,00 people during the Kickstarter campaign, the most interesting thing that happened was there was a we were like writing on Twitter to anyone who did Kickstart like anyone who talked about grass-fed beef to get them to talk about us and this one nutritionist. Um, so you're like you're reaching out to them.
(25:28) So yeah, just like we're doing this thing. This is warm outreach or sorry, this is cold outreach to uh affiliates fundamentally uh that you'd either pay for through sponsorships with money or free stuff or both. Um and then I don't know if you gave them affiliate links or it was just like hey just talk about our thing. At this point it was just talk about our thing.
(25:46) So like I'll send you a free box of meat if you just talk about it kind of thing. Yeah. Um a great way to get started early from a from a capital perspective. So it's like both of the examples that Mike talked about. first is like, okay, if there's platforms that will give you free reach, figure out what you have, you know, reverse engineer what free reach looks like and they're just getting you customers for free.
(26:04) And I think some people, especially, this is weird, but like a lot of small business owners will like obsess about like they charge 10%. It's like they charge a commission on customers they get you for free, right? What are we talking about? you know. Um, and then with the uh affiliates and and influencers that that you reached out to, another way to basically like if you if you factor in the cost, it's like literally just the hard cost of the box of meat is your advertising cost and everything above that is basically freebie. Yeah. Right.
(26:29) And so both of these are super low capital ways uh early on to to to get those initial sales going. Sorry. Yeah. So, um, this, uh, nutritionist in California, this guy Chris Cresser, tweeted like, "This is an interesting, you know, I've told you to eat grass-fed beef. This is an interesting place to get it." That's all he did.
(26:50) Um, and we saw a flurry of activity from that. And by flurry, I mean, there was like seven people who signed up. But at the time, that was like, holy, like, what what just happened? Yeah. And then we were like, you know, to what you were just talking about, we're like, we need to do more of that. like we're we need to go find every influencer who's ever talked about grass-fed beef and get them to promote promote us.
(27:09) So, if you're paying careful attention, Mike is at the third step in the scaling road map, which is advertise. He's single person. He's the doer and he's got a bunch of freelancers, right? The biggest issue he's dealing with is inconsistently flowing. He doesn't have enough money for tech. And so, that's the problems of this stage.
(27:26) And so, if he wants to solve them, which he obviously did, uh you just go over to the graduate column and do those actions. But the cool thing is that no matter where your business is at, you will be at one of these stages of scaling. And if you would like my team to personalize a roadmap specifically for you so that we can identify once you in for some information which stage you're at and send you the exact solutions of where you are to get to where you want to go.
(27:48) So all you got to go to acquisition.com/roadmap, plug in information, and then we'll send it right out to you. Uh it's one of the most valuable things I can I can give you. So enjoy. So we finished the Kickstarter uh and then we immediately and that was a CTA. So when you're pushing out to them saying, "Hey, promote our Kickstarter basically and they could send their traffic to your Kickstarter to to you know the seven buyers that came in from that from the guy who did." Is that how that's how the money came in? Uh yeah. Well, so
(28:11) Kickstarter will tell you like where like where did this come from? So it came from Twitter. So we're talking But that was but you were still in pre-sale mode for this whole thing. Yeah. Okay. Great. Um Okay. So I'm going back to an earlier point because we wanted to be capital efficient.
(28:29) Uh the whole idea was we're going to send you the butcher selections. Okay. So it I didn't want to hold inventory because I don't know how many ribe eyes we're going to sell and this is really expensive inventory. So the idea was we'll sell a bunch of stuff and then we'll just decide what to put in the box. Yeah. So we sold a bunch of stuff and then it was like okay we have 1100 boxes.
(28:48) We talked to the the place that we were working with. They created you know these different Did they have all types of meat? The one place they went they did. So Wow. That was fortunate. Yeah. We started working with this company in Wisconsin that did they had a cutting facility and a pickpack ship facility. It was like they did everything. So they just had it and they had no marketing basically. Yeah. Great.
(29:04) Yeah. Okay. Um and so we we shipped out all these boxes. Yeah. And then called every we shipped them out really quickly. It was like a week. Um they were thrown for Kickstarter. Yeah. They're like, "Wow, I got my box already." And then we called them. Hey, how are things going? Do you need any recipes? Would you like to become a subscriber? Yeah.
(29:24) and signed up like 40% of the people. Amazing. So, right away we had like, you know, Well, you didn't just send an email to,00 people. Wouldn't that have been easier? Nope. We had a guy Nikki Graham who picked up the phone and just like pounded the phone and uh he was like $10 an hour plus like a $5 spiff.
(29:40) I just want to I just want to hit on this just cuz like these what's nice is that you're hitting all these really clear milestones that I feel like are just forgotten. um which is like just the elbow grease of what I'll consider like unscalable work or unscalable effort is like a lot of times early on everyone's looking for like I don't know if that scales. Yeah.
(29:58) Um it's like well I mean you know we uh we hand wrote you know 1,100 cards and we manually reached out to every single person and we had conversations with them and we asked them if they knew anybody else who'd be interested just like the basics that everyone's like oh I'm sure that would work. It's like right but it would just be work. Yeah.
(30:15) Um and you did it and obviously it worked. Yeah. Well, and one thing that I think is important is I knew that I couldn't do that. Yeah. Like if you put me in a room with a phone and said, "Call 1100 people." No way. Like the business wouldn't have gone anywhere. And so it's good to know what you're good at and what you're not good at, what you're willing to do, what you're not willing to do, and invest in the areas that you're not willing to do because if you believe in the business, you there's a guy who for $10 an hour is just like, "Okay, just Yeah.
(30:38) He's thrilled. Yeah. And he was good at it and like then I didn't have to do it. But I think too often entrepreneurs um take the approach of like they need to do everything. Yeah. And like I mean the business would not exist if we hadn't made those phone calls, but if it was up to me, I would never make those phone calls.
(30:58) Was there an offer that you gave them for the subscription? The 40% besides like, hey, want to sign up? I don't remember. like get your next box for $10 off your next box or you get the you get bacon for free in your next box if you subscribe. There must have been but I don't I don't actually remember. Um but what did happen was we launched uh butcherbox.com.
(31:19) So in the background we signed up these people and we we realized affiliates was a thing. So we you know started working on that. We launched butcherbox.com to the world and there were many people who were trying to get in on the Kickstarter and they let you put up a link. So they were coming to our website and they were buying.
(31:37) So right away we signed up like five subscribers, 10 subscribers like on the first day. Yeah. And what happened was um we had a little tech issue. So when those new subscribers signed up uh they got free bacon in their first box because we built the tech to be like bacon's going in every first box. Yeah. And two weeks in I get a call from the tech guys. They're like we have a really bad problem on our hands. I was like what what's going on? And they're like, "We've been sending bacon to everybody.
(32:02) " And I was like, "Oh my god, this is bad." And then uh my marketing guy was like, "Why don't we just tell people sign up and get free bacon?" Yeah. And it was like, "Oh, well, we can't shut it off anyway. Let's do that." The thing's broken. Yeah. It's broken. Like we can't fix it.
(32:19) So, we're just going to That became the That became the Because I know that one. And like I knew that before I even had like heard or met you or heard the story from Harley and whatnot. Um, so I again like Grand Slam offers like and and you know the free box of bacon like I I've heard of that. Um, and so started with get bacon in your box and then uh two years in we created this bacon for life offer. Yes.
(32:39) And that really took off. That was like that was a ripper. Um uh so you just oneuped an already really good offer and said not only do you get it in the first box, you'll get it in every box as long as you stay subscribed.
(32:56) as long as you stay a subscriber and you know ultimately the bacon costs $4 and the box you know you're making your profit off of. So it's like you're it's not that big of a deal. Um and you definitely acquire customers for less than four like the arbitrage on CAC or you know CPA depending on what industry you're in. Yeah.
(33:14) Uh cost to acquire customer significantly higher by basically said differently if you add bacon for life in your cost to acquire a customer drops by more than the cost of the bacon. Uh more importantly they stayed longer. Really? Yeah. Oh, because now you have your free bacon. You don't want to get rid of your free bacon. And so they can't come back. Well, they you now you can't if you if you if you quit, uh you lose your for life offers. But we have that we've built a whole thing around these for life offers.
(33:36) Our our our top people have been with us from the beginning have like six or seven for life offers that they get every month. They're like, why would I ever go anywhere else to buy my meat? Like I'm I have all these for life. Okay, talk to me more about this because it's really interesting.
(33:49) So, how can they stack multiple for life offer? Like, if I'm one of the 40%, right? So, I signed up on my subscription and I still have the tech malfunction. So, I get free bacon every month. Okay. How am I getting these other ones? Well, so pretty soon after, I mean, this is several years in. This was like, you know, we're fast forwarding like five or six years.
(34:05) We started offering like, okay, free bacon for life is kind of getting overused. Let's try ground beef for life. Okay. And then people were signing up on ground beef for life. M But then our customers, our current customers are like, "What the hell?" Like, "I want ground beef for life." So then we just started selling ground beef for life to our customers.
(34:24) So we're like, "Okay, for $50 we'll sell you ground Yeah. ground beef for life." So we just stacked all of these like offers on top of each other. Um very few people. your gross margins went down on some of those people, but like they never they're just never they're just the base that just like never and we've gotten smarter at being like it's for a year for life and it's like we've gotten a lot smarter and you lose them if you leave and like but um yeah, bacon bacon really built this we built this business on bacon. Um, so, uh, the the there's
(34:58) one one channel. Well, I'll just say, yeah, there's the influencer channel, which we'll we can talk about. The other thing that So, was it went Kickstarter arbitrage, influencer arbitrage, and then Facebook video arbitrage. Okay. So, I want to talk about I'm guessing paid ads became the next like Yes. after influencer. Yeah.
(35:18) So, how did you do influ? So, okay. I'm I'm going to retrace the steps real quick. So, we had Kickstarter and then uh then you officially opened the site. Kickstarter had a backlink to you so people would go to the Kickstarter cuz they had good SEO and good rankings, whatever. And suddenly they'd find you. You started getting sales every day. You have your mess up on bacon, but you're like, you know what, screw it.
(35:35) Let's give everybody bacon. Um and so the influencer strategy worked well for the Kickstarter. So, you kind of double down on that and say, "How do we get every influencer on the planet to talk about Butcher Box?" Yes, that was So, did you go like Instagram, Twitter, like you just went across the different channels for influencers? No.
(35:51) So what we did was we figured out that there's a company Thrive Market. Um they're a big like online um Thrive had done this um had done this thing where they they had all these influencers and they they gave a lot of them equity. Okay. In the company to like actively promote interesting. They were like kind of the first ones to unlock influencers. Okay.
(36:11) And so first we reached out to like everyone who mentioned grass-fed beef. Sure. And then we realized that there's like a lot more people in health and wellness. And so we uh like Thrive Market's URL was like slashpartner slash one. Okay. And then slash two slash3. And so we just like concatenated all the URLs and just like took every single person and then found their website and their contact information. Oh, so you didn't go to Thrive, you just reverse engineered Thrive. We reverse engineered all their influencers. Got a got a lead list of
(36:41) 400 people. And then like I I think you'll like this part like cuz it I like that part. The offer. That's a good one. That's a good way to get your warm leads. How I got my first leads for gym launch was um paid a VA to go to CrossFit's website. Sorry, CrossFit.
(37:00) Um and literally look up every single uh affiliate that affiliate box that they had. Yep. And so because and gym owners usually put their personal cell phone numbers, their personal email as their actual like thing on the on the CrossFit site, but they wanted to get listed because they're paying $3,000 a year to get the listing of saying I'm an official CrossFit, right? But for me, I got like at the time, this is super early, you know? We had like 1,600 names on this list, but it was enough for Facebook to make a look audience off of that. And that single lookike audience is like what built Gym Launch. Like I
(37:26) didn't like I tried to hit all these different audiences and nothing worked. And as soon as I hit the ads to that audience, it was like ding ding ding. And I was like, "Oh my god, this works." And so you reverse engineered your list. Also elbow grease for both of these, right? Like you just looked at the site, looked at the directories, and manually like paste the stuff over. Yeah.
(37:44) But again, you know, like you used a VA. I used a VA as well. I used somebody in the Philippines who for like 20 cents a record, it's just like here you go. And you sleep and it's like there the next day. Exactly. So the way that we reached out to these influencers I thought was pretty genius.
(38:02) So we had this box, right? We're shipping a box of meat and at the time there was like Blue Apron, HelloFresh and all these companies and they all even No, Blue Apron's gone, right? Or they're uh 2015 they were hot. Yeah. Yeah, I remember that. Yeah. Uh Blue Apron is now was purchased by Mark Lori who um did Jet.com and they're trying to like make something.
(38:20) Um and then HelloFresh was a darling a little later than that. And HelloFresh is still around there. Okay. Yeah. I'm not. Um, so, uh, at the time, Blue Apron and HelloFresh would include a recipe in the box. Okay. And our customers were like, "This is really great, but I'd love a recipe." Yeah.
(38:39) And so, what we did is we reached out to these influencers and we're like, "Hey, we started this company on grass-fed beef because we believed in like eating grass-fed beef and you tal you've talked about grass-fed beef and but we didn't see a source of where to buy it. So, we'd like to be that source." Okay. And by the way, we're shipping out all these boxes and we don't have any recipes.
(38:58) And what we'd like to do is include your recipe on and the VA would like, you know, find Taco Bell. Yeah. Yeah. Steak, whatever. And we we'd love to include that in our box. And so these influencers who like trade on influence are like, "Of course. Yeah, use my recipe. No problem.
(39:17) Are you going to like link to my website and all that stuff?" We're like, "Yeah, yeah." They're like, "By the way, what's Butcher Box?" And we're like, "Perfect. Let's talk." So that was like that was like we called it the Trojan horse. It was like not only do you get the recipes for free, but you also get, you know, you get in contact with all these you get them to reply to you. And as soon as they reply to us, then it was like, let's talk about Budget Box.
(39:39) So I I want to double click on that real quick. So if you're dealing with influencers, you have to think about the currency they care about most. And a lot of influencers care more about fame than they do about money. Yep. And so you were able to deal in the currency they preferred. Yep. That's right. Yeah.
(39:55) So just as like for any any business it's like is there a way that we can do this that's that's realist that like actually provides real value to them in the way that they want to get value which I think is actually like a really brilliant like little nugget. Yeah. Um okay so this is 2016 so this is a long time ago. Yeah.
(40:12) At the time the influencers especially in the health and wellness space like didn't really know their value. Yeah. Um and so we were able to go to those influencers and say look like we don't have any money. We can't pay you upfront. I'm not paying you like $5,000 to send an email. What we can do is we'll pay you $10 or $15 per subscriber for every month that they remain a subscriber. So, for life.
(40:31) Yeah, that's great. Um, bacon for life. Yeah, commissions for life. For missions, commissions for life. And, uh, people said yes. They started, "Yeah, I'll do that. I'll do that." And so, we figured out that, you know, um, tweets didn't work, Facebook posts didn't work.
(40:50) The thing that worked was a dedicated email blast where they would be like, "Here's Butcher Box. Let me introduce this to you." And then ideally with a last chance, like a last chance thing, and there was always an offer, $20 off, free bacon, whatever it was. And because we're only paying these influencers $10 or $15 a month, um, we could do all of this and be box one profitable, meaning we still made money because we started with a $20 profit. We still made money on that first box.
(41:18) M or at least it was like we made a penny is the is the So I want let's talk about now that we're here let's talk about the box economics. So you're profitable on box one which if we're juxtaposing this with uh custommade right um I I always fundament like there are some business it's basically I think there are significantly fewer businesses that actually rely on outside capital to to work than people like if you want to build rockets it's probably yeah tough right like you probably have to do that but so I see a lot of businesses that like even that that hit me up and they're like hey you know I'm raising
(41:49) capital for my insert normal business and I'm like, have you considered just making money? Um, no, but like real, right? It's just like the perspective, right? And so, um, box when you're profitable. So, walk me through like what the the standard box like that most people, you know, uh, uh, what the cost is and and all the cost associated, I know you really obsess about the box. Yeah.
(42:14) Yeah. So, um, the Omaha Stakes guy who introduced us to the place in Wisconsin that we worked with, which massive by the way, the one nug Yeah. Like opened the whole business. That's why I was like, I need to start now. Um, the one nugget he left me with, he's like, "Listen, all we care about at Omaha Stakes is dollars per box.
(42:33) " I was like, "What does that mean?" He means everyone at the company knows when a box comes off the line, how much money are we making off the box? And so that's how I built the business. I started the business, right? So we were charging $129. We were trying to make a $20 profit. We were only shipping from Wisconsin, which is a nightmare for California, but it was like, so we were losing money on California, but we're like whatever. It averaged out to 20. Um, and it kept our focus.
(42:55) So, like when I And when I talk about $20 a box, I mean like all in because we put all the costs associated with it in. Yeah. So, you like fully loaded the box in terms of cost. So, it's $20 net profit. Yeah. Rather than gross profit per box. Uh, or you saying gross profit? Gross profit. Okay. Got it.
(43:13) Because we again it was hobby business. So like it wasn't our labor. It wasn't our So this is uh pickp pack. So like putting all the stuff in from our distribution center into a box, the cost of the meat, uh the cost of the box, the cost to ship the box, the cost of the dry ice that goes in the box, uh the credit card processing fees, the tape that goes on the box, like all of those things. Uhhuh.
(43:39) Um, and because we we just became doggedly focused on dollars per box. And what I love about this business even to this day is that we we get to focus on like, you know, the minutia like like negotiating the price of tape. Yeah. And the super creative like how are we going to get our next, you know, 500,000 customers. Um, and we get to do both.
(43:58) But, uh, it we we just started with a DNA of like we're going to negotiate every single line item in this box. So, what is the gross margin percentage per box currently or that? Yeah. Oh, well, both. Sure. Uh, like 30% is a is a healthy gross margin. Okay. Yeah, we we definitely want to be around or above 30%. Got it.
(44:18) Uh, one of the challenges that we have as a business is that uh at least currently. So, we're looking at pricing model change. Currently, you pay $169 and you choose six items in the box. Okay? And so it's kind of an inflationary disaster because the prices of meat fluctuate all the time.
(44:39) So if you stack it with ribe eyes, you're way less than a a 30% gross margin. If you stack it with really cheap stuff, you're way more than a 30% gross margin. That's an area where um I feel like we're in like not in alignment with our customer. So I want to change that over time. Yeah. Uh but yeah, currently we're looking at a 30%. So what are NIT margins? They're like six. Okay. Yeah.
(44:58) Got it. Got it. We did like six and a half last year. Certainly not a content business. It's very different. Yeah. Different. Yeah. Yeah. Wait, you six and a half what? Million. Oh, yeah. Percent. I was like that is a Okay. That was that was that's making sure and you did and the big the big line item. So, um these businesses like I've seen so many of them.
(45:18) Uh 30% gross margin. Yeah. Um you got 10% to operate the place. That's salaries. Uh technology. So a third goes to ops of your gross margin. Yeah. Uh and then you got 20% left over for marketing. And I like or in profit, right? And so uh these businesses at scale, what they do, what you do is you market market market for years, build your name and then just try to collapse your marketing and take it all in and hopefully get enough word of mouth. Yeah. You know, from from those customers that it can at least uh
(45:53) stave off turn. Yeah, that's the like the CPG playbook. Um, and that's what a lot of these companies are doing. It's a tough business. It is a tough business. Like it's I mean in it's so it's interesting because in so many ways it's like software.
(46:10) Y um with the exception of like rather than dealing with development, you're dealing with supply chain. That's your big like as a like I'm I know there's more fires, but like if I had if I had to simplify into like the big buckets most of the time, I feel like that's where um Well, why don't you tell me? Oh, that that's Yeah. No, I I I agree. I mean, so um you know, that was Blue Apron's whole thing.
(46:26) They raised a whole bunch of money and it was all like we're we should be valued at a software multiple. Yeah. Nowadays, box subscription companies are not valued as software multiple because there's like actual physical product being sold. Yeah. Um their stick is as high um as like a I don't know well a consumer you know consumer tech company like Shopify for example, they have 60% annual uh retention for like new new customers, right? Um, I would imagine that if if that in the consumables business that that would be unbelievably good. Yeah. Yeah. What's your retention on like a
(46:59) year one customer? Gosh, it's not how we look at it. Okay. Interesting. Yeah. Uh, it's probably around 60%. Yeah. And that's like best I mean that's those are like best-in-class numbers. I mean there's a reason that you're doing Yeah. Yeah. Is it 600 now that you guys are doing? Yeah. Well, it's like 550. Okay.
(47:17) Um, yeah. Yeah, the 600 has been out there, but it's really 550. Uh, so yeah, we're you have 550 million um profitable since day one. Um, and you own 70%. Yeah. So I, uh, I gave equity to most employees like early on. And then Yeah, like a software company, like a venture-backed one. I was like, "Oh, this is what you do. You give out equity.
(47:41) " Um, which uh, are you happy about that? In in many ways, yes. like the people who helped me build this business, the people who helped me hack through the jungle um are all millionaires. Um and you know that's cool. That's like really neat. Uh but also we have um it if you don't want to raise money Yeah.
(48:05) which I don't and you don't want to go public which I don't and you don't want to sell, which I don't. It's like how do you cash people out? Yeah. Right. Um that has been that is a a a concern of mine all the time is like so every year we've actually done a uh we've taken profits and repurchase shares so that people have valve and so then you basically set the valuation every year. Yep. Okay. Yeah. Actually we do Yeah.
(48:29) We there's a there's a 409a value somebody comes in and does a valuation. We also have done this thing which is I I don't know if your listeners are interested but we we've done this thing this year which is a reverse Dutch auction. Okay. So we like we're going to allocate this much money to buy shares and then we people can say what they're willing to sell at and then we we bought them that way which is pretty interesting. That's awesome. Yeah.
(48:53) Um that's very interesting. Yeah. It's a really it's it's actually more common now. Um, and it's a really great way to get like what the actual market value is cuz when you do evaluation, it's like not dude who makes it up. Who knows? So during co co was we grew the business tremendously and we almost shut off marketing.
(49:13) So I mean we just made so much profit and then we bought all these shares and we just started buying and buying and buying. But then inflation took over and so our inflationary disaster like our margins just got super compressed. So, we went from like a 30% gross margin to a 25% gross margin after doing two price increases after. Jeez.
(49:30) So, it was like there was no money. Um, and we never like ran out of money, but you know, we're all looking around being like, "Dude, we just like did a share buyback like for 20 or $30 million over the past like three years. I'd really love that money right now." Yeah, that'd be nice. Like, hey, can I uh Yeah. No Indian.
(49:48) Do you want some shares? All right. Well, did you so with So, this is this is a great follow-up question. So, um do you take regular distributions from the company or have you just been like kind of like you took once or twice and that's like my you know my family set and now everything's still like me personally. Yeah. Yeah. Um I take uh a salary. Okay.
(50:10) Um and a bonus and then um very early on because we started as an LLC um I I owned all of the technology and employed everybody. Okay. And the company bought that from me. Got it. And so there's been distributions to cover that. And you control both companies. So you have to pick what that was valued at. Uh that had to be third party.
(50:28) Oh, was it? Okay. Got to be fair to the shareholders, but it's not all you, right? Exactly. Yeah. Okay. Um Yeah. So So when you've been doing the buybacks, um were you at like 50/50 and then over time you've kind of like bought your way back to 7030 or Yeah, I think I think Yeah, I think it was like 60 and now it's Well, originally Yeah.
(50:49) the uh the Omaha stakes guy and there was also a brand guy. They this my biggest mistake when I started the company after after failing at custom made was I value the company at a stupidly low rate. Okay. And so I had just raised $10 million on a $30 million valuation. I started this and I'm like it's going to be a hobby. This isn't going to be anything.
(51:11) So the Omaha Stakes guy is like I can make all these connections. I can do all this stuff and it's uh $75,000 worth of work. And I'm like, well, I don't have that, so I'll give you equity. And he's like, okay, great. How much is the company worth? I was like, 750 grand. So, he took 10% of the company. So, he's he's a 10% stakeholder. Not anymore. I bought him out.
(51:29) Uh, and then there was a brand guy, which was the same thing. 10% of the company. And as we got going, I was like, ah, that that's like way too much. And they're not doing anything, right? Yeah. Yeah. They did one time work. It's like onetime work, right? Uh, and so we bought them out. We bought them out when the valuation was 48 million.
(51:46) Well, I'm sure they were thrilled. And it was Yeah. two They got $200,000 a month for two years. Okay. Um I'm sure he was still thrilled, you know, right? Probably more than he made at Omaha. Totally. Yeah. Way more. Um one one good phone call for him. Yep. Right. A little bit of work. Yeah. Yeah. Except for life. Interesting. So, okay.
(52:07) So, man, there's so many directions I want to go, but uh to to to put a button on on on the story and then I want to go back and kind of unpack some numbers and things like that. Um where do you want to so where do you want to if you're not going to IPO? Y and you're not going to sell the company and the CPG playbook is that at some point you turn off the marketing. When is that? Yeah. Um not anytime soon. Okay.
(52:33) So, you just want you want to keep going for a minute. Yeah. So, um, do you have a goal like a billion a year in sales or I mean a billion I'm very goal oriented so I do have a billion on my whiteboard but I recognize that before that I had a million and before that I had 10 million and then 100 million.
(52:50) So a billion will be enough for sure. Yeah, totally. Then it'll be enough. Yeah. Then I'll just lay down my arms and walk away and then you'll be happy. You know I'm just messing around. Yep. Exactly. Um, yeah. I would like I think running this to a billion in revenue would be a lot of fun.
(53:08) Uh I don't know how fast that's going to be. Uh we've definitely learned that it's it's it's gotten a lot harder. Like as you grow you just lose people and you know it's just harder. Yeah. 1% on how many customers do you have right now? Like 430,000. Yeah. So 1% on 430,000. It's like oh all of a sudden that's just you know 4,300 customers that we just have if we lose 1%.
(53:29) It's like okay that's a decent amount of customers. And you're like, well, if it's 10% churn annually, and you said I think you were keeping Well, 60 of your one or something. No, I mean, our our churn is like 3% a month, right? Yeah. So, that's 30-ish% or whatever. Means you have to sign up 12,000 people a month before you stop treading water just to chill. Just Yeah.
(53:48) Yeah. So, it's like it's those numbers just kept going. That's 400 a day. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Right. 400 a day. So, while we're talking right now, people are saying, "Yeah, just like they're leaving. They're leaving. Yeah, they're falling out, right? Don't leave people. Like, we have a great product, dude. You have bacon for life.
(54:05) What are we talking about? Yeah, you're losing your for life offer. Yeah. Like, I I really do love the um the lifetime the lifetime offers. Um yeah, I have a book that's coming out that talks about this this particular offer structure. So, um a lot of fun. Yeah, lifetime offer. I people getting a box of meat um seemed really magical. Like I was like, wait, wait, this is going to show up. It's going to be frozen. Like, I don't trust it.
(54:28) So, uh, money back guarantee, like no questions asked. We'll just we'll just refund you. Let me let me talk to some of the fears of business owners around money back guarantees because I talk about them a lot, too. Um, what percentage of customers do you get uh who ask for refunds on on like a monthly basis? Oh gosh, I don't like so small I don't even know the number, right? And the conversion increase is certainly worth having. For sure.
(54:51) For sure. Also, like um you know, one of our core values is being customer obsessed. Yeah. like we actually want to deliver you an amazing product, right? And so if we fail at that, you should get your money back. Um that's like and it's like, well, I'm I'm worried about that. Well, fix your product. Make your product better.
(55:11) Like spend time obsessing over your product and you you'll do very well with money back. It's like dollar per box and then also like happiness per box, like on the customer side, like your delight per box. Totally. Yeah. I mean, it's all about your well the the metric that is commonly used is the net promoter score.
(55:28) So, it's all about your satisfaction with the and we're constantly asking what's your NPS right now? Uh, it's like a 63. That's great. Yeah. Yeah. We're pretty happy with that. So, but there's room for improvement. I mean, we we know our issues. We want to we we want a perfect experience every time. Yeah. And when you're shipping multiple species, you know, you 12 to 15.
(55:46) Do you do fish now? Yeah, we do seafood. How did that how did you get was that just a whole another have to find another supplier? Yeah, I mean we don't use any of that. Um so basically we got going we'll go all the way back. We we got going. We're shipping out boxes. We're making $20 a box. The influencer thing is working. We get to about 6,000 subscribers. Okay.
(56:05) And it was clear to me that we had no idea what we were doing. It was like, okay, we've been faking it. That's great, but like we need somebody who knows how to buy me. We need an adult here. Um, and so again, I went to LinkedIn, usually while on the toilet, uh, and I reached out to, um, this guy who lived in Boston and, um, ran meat and seafood at one of these big grocery chains, right? Uh, but he had retired. Okay.
(56:35) And so I was like, interesting background, let's talk. Yeah. Pulled him out of retirement. And he came and started purchasing meat and seafood for us. Meat and then seafood. Yeah. And I mean the saving my whole thing was okay we're shipping 60,000 pounds of meat. I've got all I have to believe is that somebody can save me like 25 cents a pound and this is like worth it. Right.
(56:55) So um he came in and just he's like you guys are paying this like second day. He's like you guys are paying enough in chicken breast that you could send people three pounds instead of one pound. Do you want me to do that? And I'm like yeah that'd be good. Yeah. 25 cents was the target.
(57:13) and he was like, "I can give you a buck and a half." And you're like, "Totally." I mean, multiples of his of his salary back. Um, and you know, I think it's really important to that you hire experts in certain areas at the right time, but in certain areas.
(57:30) Well, I want to so I want to I want to hit on on the the meta part of this, which is like, all right, like the big the big turning points because I like I like like what are those those inflection points in the business? So, it's like, all right, you switch from raising money to pre-selling. That's pro I feel like that's like setting yourself up on the right path. Okay, so that was number one.
(57:49) Number two, um, is you realize this influencer thing has some legs to it and then you go hardcore on getting influencers. You also reverse engineer somebody else's database, which I highly recommend if you're trying to reach out to people um, to find the high like I call them HBTs, but uh, high value targets like how do we how do we find the HBTs and then and then grab them. Okay, so you do that.
(58:03) um you have a happy accident with free bacon that ends up being a core component um of the offer and then later um you turn on the lifetime version of that and then you do that across kind of horizontally across the box. You obsess about gross margin per box.
(58:23) So whatever your unit economics are of the business, you got super dot on that and just want to make every single p every single penny count because it you know you're on the same side of the table figuratively as the customer. you got experts um in at the right times. The branding person up front, the Omaha stakes guy, later the meat purchasing guy um that all came in at key points to like unlock, you know, levels of profitability and growth.
(58:42) What's what are some of the other ones that that that might have been skipped over in the Gez man that's good. Just like boil it down in a good way. Um I think working like so our backbone today, we still don't own our backbone. So, uh distribution, we don't do we don't own our own farms. We don't own our employing. No. Okay. I was um because we believe that it's better to work with partners. It's kind of like the Toyota approach. Work with partners.
(59:06) Hold them hold their feet to the fire. Hold them to a tight speck. Uh have them do things they're not doing for anyone else, but trust that they know better than me. I don't know anything about farming. I don't know anything about slaughterhouses. Like that's a bad place for me to spend my time.
(59:24) Uh the only piece of our entire backbone that we control is dry ice. We have two dry plants. Okay. Um and that's because if you don't have dries, you can't ship a box. Yeah. And so we were like, we should It's like a great insurance policy. Yeah. Everything else because you lose that revenue goes to zero. Yeah.
(59:41) Right. Yeah. That's everything else is like not um I I don't think it's worth us taking. And so and I think that's like one common mistake in box subscription companies, in overfunded companies, and just with the entrepreneurs in general. Yeah. You need to you need to like own everything. you need to control all of it. And uh that has been a huge It's actually been a huge um part of our success.
(1:00:04) Well, then let's So, because I'm sure you've had partnerships that didn't go well. Yep. And you've obviously been really good at building these relationships. So, to the greatest degree possible, do you have any kind of test for how you judge a partner's ability to fulfill on their promises before you've started working with them? Because obviously, you know, you're bringing a huge amount of business.
(1:00:25) There's a significant risk that you take on by having a, you know, a partner do something bad. There's obviously with food there's huge liabilities of a whole, you know, a whole state has rotten meat. It's like, I mean, it's a it's more of a PR nightmare. It took Chipotle years to to to live down the salmonila issue that they had as a micro example. Yeah.
(1:00:44) Um, so I mean on the on the meat side, we do robust safety audits and you like we're not working with you unless we've done a whole bunch of audits. Um, on the other partner side, we're generally trying to work with the best best people, like best-in-class. So, you just look at an industry and say, "Okay, we we want to find okay, so of all the different farms in the US that are grass-fed, who's the biggest and the best and you're just trying to do a deal with them?" Yeah. I mean, you you you try to balance like um helping small farmers, right? Um and working with big
(1:01:15) farmers because a small farmer might have 50 head and we might need like 100,000 head, right? So we can't work with 2,000 small farmers. We work with we generally work with collectives that then work with the farmers. So we're working with that collective saying this is what we want. This is our spec.
(1:01:32) This is how we want it raised. And then they go and find the farmers. Um, and again it's like we don't want to be on the ground. You know, I love meeting with farmers and doing all that, but like I that can't be what we do for inspecting hooves is probably So it's like really important to know what you're good at and what you're not good at.
(1:01:54) And anything that you're not good at, including picking up the phone, 1100 times, like just don't do try to get someone else to do it because you can't I don't think you can build a business unless you're feeling that flow and you're feeling like really engaged. And that can only be done in the the work that you're really good at. You've been really good at picking those people though.
(1:02:11) So like what what's your obviously there's the reputation of the company, right? But like also you're really good at picking like the Omaha Stakes guy and the branding guy that you picked out and even Nick who did those first, you know, 1100 calls. Like what do you what do you cuz it's it's an uncanny trait like you've been really good at it. Just I'm just like listening to the story.
(1:02:29) I have you haven't mentioned I'm sure there were some horror stories but like um it seems like you've had a huge amount of success and I I feel like if I had had a different entrepreneur in the chair I would have I could I could totally hear the total other side of the story. I went to a couple partners early.
(1:02:48) What I learned is you got to control everything if you want you know like I've you know I mean like I've heard that side and so you're obviously better at picking partners than most people. So like what do you think about in trying to isolate like this person will work? Yeah. I mean so early on when you're talking about your first employees um I I have this analogy.
(1:03:07) I think I stole it from someone but like uh building a company is like hacking through the jungle with machetes. And so you're just like there's you're just dropped in the middle of the jungle. You have a machete. You're like uh I don't know where we're going. Yeah. At that point you need people who are just going to hack day and night with you. like you just and it's grit. Yeah. So, I'm looking for athletes. I'm looking for people who have failed at something.
(1:03:24) I'm looking for people with a chip on their shoulder, you know, daddy issues, all that because I've got all that. So, like, you know, I I want to, you know, as all great men do, I uh that's the type of person I want. And then as you grow, uh you realize that like, okay, we need some experience here.
(1:03:43) And how do we get experience? One thing, and this doesn't totally answer your question, but one thing that we did that was like I think pretty um I thought was pretty smart is uh I called it the barbell strategy. We hired people like out of retirement. Okay. Because they were so far along in their career. Yeah.
(1:04:03) And we found that the middle like so really young and really old worked incredibly well. I would say personally I've had a lot of experience with that too. Yeah. And the middle is like they're super busy. They've got kids. They've got all these commitments. They want this to be like the one mark on their career. Yeah. The one career the career like careerists rather than people who want to do the work. Hunger. Hunger. Yeah.
(1:04:19) It's interesting because the people at the very beginning want to work all the time because they want to learn a lot. Y the people at the end want to work because they have nothing else to do and they want to in some ways like give have their experience be used like they want to be useful legacy, right? And that both of those are actually concentrated on the work itself rather than the label ascribed to the work. Totally.
(1:04:38) And everyone a lot of times people in the middle are it's like you're three years on my resume uh and I want to you know just leverage this brand. I need to go from director to VP and then I need this and I need this and and yeah we just found that people on the ends were just like so grateful and and so like my title obsession. Yeah.
(1:04:55) Yeah. I hate it. My meat guy. I just remember this uh dinner I was at and it's like I my me guy and uh Blue Apron's meat guy was there and Blue Apron's meat guy is like 32 years old in like skinny jeans and a nice vest and my meat guy is this like grizzled like 65year-old is like who do you think's buying chicken for cheaper? Yeah.
(1:05:15) Like like my guy looks like meat. Yeah. Yeah. Like Yeah. I mean, so um that has been uh and and that is uh I don't really like I don't really know what's happened here. Like I I like to say like the the business wanted to be something way bigger than I expected. Interesting. And I just honor that as like some of these people just kind of fell into my lap.
(1:05:40) Um but I I definitely my first company I I knew people were off culture and I hired them anyway. And this time around, we wrote down our core values and we're like, "Okay, this is what we're this is what we're hiring for." Um, one of our core values is relentless improvement.
(1:06:01) And, uh, to your question about partners, um, any partner you work with, there's going to be problems. Sure. And we're just not afraid to talk about them. We do quarterly business reviews. We're like, you know, auditing. We're doing a whole bunch of stuff and telling you what you're doing wrong so you can fix it. Because most partners don't want to like just they want to fire the relationship or not not talk to you.
(1:06:17) It's like no, let's just keep getting better. Yeah. Like let's just get better. Like we want to lock arms with you and get you better and so we're also because we're trying to build a long-term thing like we're just locking arms with partners and trying to just move forward with them. Talk to me.
(1:06:34) So given the the growth rate that you had so it was like was it it was like 5 million was the first like or second year I think of business, right? Yeah. So we started in September of 2015 and we did like 200 in the Kickstarter. We did like 500 grand and then we did 5 million and then 33 million and then 105 million 220. Then COVID hit we went to 450. Yeah.
(1:06:53) And then you had what like 5 and then 500ish the next year. 450 550 550 570. Yeah. And then last uh two years ago, so 2023 we went down for the first year. Okay. which was pretty heartbreaking for a team that you know prides ourselves on growth. So talk to me. So and then last year we started growing again. Okay, that's good.
(1:07:13) So I have I have two followups. So first one is talk to me about rush rushing like what's your because like you you grew really fast. Yep. And then you and then you were essentially flat for like basically four years. Yeah. So what's huh? So what's how does your perspective on where you want to take the company affect how you run the company with regards to growth's rate? Yeah.
(1:07:43) And like rush around goals. Yeah. I like talking about rush a lot because I think it's where all mistakes happen. And you grow really fast without the intention of growing really fast. Yeah. Which I find has happened to me multiple times. Yeah. Um, you know, I think that we, so we grew, obviously, we grew incredibly quickly.
(1:08:10) Um, the biggest mistake that we made, the biggest rush that we made was we um the wheels kind of felt like they were falling off the bus. Yeah. At like 450. Okay. And we decided to bring in a whole bunch of people. Mhm. to help like fix the wheels. We need bodies. Yeah. We need bodies. We need bodies and we need managers. We need people in the middle. The middle, right? Yeah. What was head count? Just so I have context.
(1:08:35) What was head count at that at at like I mean going into CO we were 85 people. Uh so doing 200 going into CO with a headcount of 80. Yeah. Great. And then uh coming like uh end of 21 we were at like two like one maybe 1 160 and then we got to a height of 240. Yeah.
(1:09:02) Uh with designs on you know we're going to be like 300 people. Yeah. And now I'm like you know what like 150 sounds really good, right? Yeah. So, um, yeah, we currently have we have 25 associates in our drives facility and then like 170 people outside of that. Um, and so the rush was we hired a lot of people and what what happens to companies and apparently I've learned now that this is a classic $500 million trap.
(1:09:25) So, you can add a book to your your thing later. The $500 million trap is something bad happens. You hire a bunch of people because you don't know enough and they everyone starts saying no. Yeah. And you go from um capital E entrepreneurship like a bunch of pirates like very little process.
(1:09:49) We're just going and growing and like to like oh we need we need process like we need capital P process and entrepreneurship needs to come way down here and that's what happened. You guys are a bunch of kids. You're a bunch of kids like you, Mike, are like, you know, have all these ideas and like we need to collaborate with you and Hey guys, so if you're paying careful attention, let me read what the stage of scaling road map was at when he was telling the stories about going from 80 to 180 plus employees.
(1:10:13) Does it sound like uh recruiters are holding inconsistent standards and the culture suffered? Would you say that there were so many new and existing employees, performance suffers, compliance issues, and complaints skyrocket? Would you say that you're still paying retail for everything? Right. and he's getting overcharged. Cash is unprotected and not getting good returns.
(1:10:30) Would you say that was pretty indicative of exactly what he was going through? Well, that's because he was at the stage of specialize, right? And so, the crazy thing is that businesses behave in patterns. And so, if you'd like to know what stage of scaling you're at, you can go to acquisition.com/roadmap. It's absolutely free. It's our gift to you. We put a ton of time and effort in this. It's probably the biggest gift I can give you. Um, and like I said, it's free.
(1:10:49) So, go there, check it out. It'll tell you exactly what you need to do to get to the next level. and um enjoy it. And that's what happened. And at the meantime, I broke my arm. Like my everything in my life kind of fell apart at the same time. And uh it was it was a slog. Uh and I'm I'm really proud. Like last year we grew like 6%. And I'm like, "Yeah, like we'll take it." Yeah.
(1:11:12) Um and you know, so sometime along the journey, um I went from like this is a hobby to I'm going to just flip this thing. like let me build this up and sell it to for $100 million and I went on a couple meetings and I was like it just doesn't feel right. Interesting. And then I I just it just kind of over time came to me of um the meat industry is broken. Yeah.
(1:11:36) Uh animals are not being treated well in this country and that's like hurting the health of like people who are eating it. And it's like I just wish there was a company that like wasn't funded, had no one breathing down their neck, who could just take the play the long ball. Yeah.
(1:11:54) And just like this might take 25 years, might take a hundred years, but who cares? Like we're in it for the long and then after a while it was like after pointing out everyone else who should be doing that, it's like oh maybe that's me. Yeah. Um and so I have no idea if this is what's going to happen, but the the plan is to build a multi-generational long-term hold. Um, if you look at food companies in the US, many of them are family controlled, multigenerational, long-term holds.
(1:12:20) Um, and so that's kind of like that's how I've built since the past few years. Yeah. Uh, while reinserting myself and becoming a becoming a pirate organization again. Does it feel better? Yes. Yeah. I mean, we um we did a lot of work in the middle layer like a lot of directors, a lot of Yeah. Yeah. At our at our height, we had 230 people and um 85 managers.
(1:12:47) Managers manager managing manage manager managed to um 85 managers. So like the average person had like one person underneath them. Yeah. I just equated to um like the restaurant worker where the receipt comes out and they grab it and they're like where's the chicken parm? Yeah.
(1:13:06) Yeah. On their phone like chicken parm, you know? It's like dude, what do you do all day? Yeah. Um and so we've done a lot of work in in like retasking people and just making sure that people are in the right seats doing things doing things and uh it it feels much better. We're moving much quicker. We're growing. We're Yeah. So you're losing 12,000 customers a month.
(1:13:25) Yeah. Something like that. Yeah. How do you have any idea what the split is of new customers per month in terms of where the sources of customers come from? And is there a an acquisition channel that you have not mentioned so far that has that majorly contributes to that? Yeah, so uh right now we're we're heavily on referral and heavily on meta.
(1:13:52) Those are like the two ads and refer like meta ads and referrals. Ads and referrals. Um, what's the split? Uh, we're like, um, 30% referral. Okay. Uh, and then I don't know what meta is because it's, you know, there's also organic and Google and whatnot. Uh, say 30% Meta and 20% organic. Yeah.
(1:14:20) Affiliate, all the other channels, influencers are 10 or whatever it is. Yeah. Yeah. Um, referrals been really interesting. Uh we now if you're a member you can uh refer a friend for a trial box and it cost $20. Mhm. Um and we've just seen that work really well. Does the refer what does the referer get? Uh nothing. Okay. Yeah.
(1:14:37) Uh we tried a whole bunch of different things that you get $50, you get this, you get that. What they what they like the most is giving their friends a box that's almost free. They just pay for shipping and handling. Oh, so like a free plus shipping basically. So it's like box is free. It's $20 for shipping and handling kind of thing. Exactly. Interesting.
(1:14:50) So that's another offer. Yeah. Yep. And uh that's worked really well like the you obviously get a lot of people who just take get one box. They're like sweet free meat and then they cancel. But um you know executed well you see a lot of people stay and then they just become great customers and yeah referrals are better customer.
(1:15:08) Yeah if you like a referred customer is a better customer. Um and so we've really leaned into that as a program because it compounds at scale which is why it's so great. Yeah. Exactly. Um, yeah, we've shipped a box to 1.7 million 1.75 million households in this country. Um, and so at a certain point you're like, how do we inspire those people to do the sales on our behalf rather than us trying to like, you know, retarget people on Facebook? Yeah. So, um, there's there's two com two things that I wanted to get into.
(1:15:39) So, one is the ad strategy and second is if I'm not mistaken, you guys did a media play, correct? Recently. Yep. Yeah. I want to talk about that because I think that's really cool. So, let's do media play first. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. We bought a company called Truffle Shuffle. Uh it's these two two guys. Uh one's actually in Vegas. We're going to see him tonight for dinner.
(1:15:58) Um and they they raised money on Shark Tank. And during CO, they decided that they were going to sell truffles direct to consumer. These little mushrooms that are hard to get. And then once they started selling truffles, they realized that no one knows how to cook them. Um and so they started doing these instructional videos like you have like DeJouro and I'm just putting my shovel. Exactly.
(1:16:15) People are like how do I what do I do with this? Yeah. Uh and that took off and this is like co where um everyone's at home trying to all these corporations are trying to like you know uh treat their staff well and stuff and whatnot. So um yeah so they they ran a pretty interesting business for a while.
(1:16:37) great content, thousands of classes where they're teaching people how to cook and live. Uh also recorded but live. Um and they just like that they're experts ato hosting a live class to cook. Yeah. Virtual. Virtual. Yeah. Our biggest challenge as a company, if you look at our churn, the people who are leaving, our biggest challenge as a company is how do I inspire you to take the meat out of your freezer? Yeah. Yeah. They put it in there and they're like, "Oh, I've got two months worth. Like, I don't need any." Right. And people think of
(1:17:09) their freezer as like a savings account rather than a like And so when you say, "What's for dinner?" You open your fridge. Yeah. And look inside or you look on your phone and or something. So, how are we going to like inspire you? Well, one way to do that is if we do cooking classes. Mhm.
(1:17:26) So, we um you know, really like the founders, Jason and Tyler, and just uh decided that it was a good fit. We got it for you know, like a good price, which I don't think I could talk about, but Yeah. And uh we ended up ingesting them. And so now we're doing cooking classes for our members. We're doing And that's included in the subscription. Yeah. Included in the subscription.
(1:17:46) Do you do So how much of it is public and like available for people who are not buyers? We're trying to figure that out. Okay. Um cuz I'm so like cuz I don't know how big of a media company in terms of like you know impressions they do but like it cuz my whole my whole my whole business model around content is just demonstration right it's just like show don't sell.
(1:18:08) Yeah. And then the selling will occur. Yeah. Um and so like whenever you have the opportunity in my opinion that's the that's the most elegant you know way of of selling. Yes. Um, and so like these, you know, high-end chefs having these really engaged high-end, you know, I mean, obviously Yeah. Right. Yeah.
(1:18:25) They're highend. Yeah. Um, I because on one level there's the retention piece. Um, but I have this theory around the idea that so I think this is this I don't have a double blind placebo test here, but this is Alex's opinion. Um, I think that you retain customers that pay for a subscription with free content that's available for everyone for a couple reasons. Number one, a lot of people don't log into stuff.
(1:18:56) It's just like you're not like, "Oh, I'm going to go log in. What's my password?" And then it's already you're already like gone. It doesn't it's not going to happen. So, the reason that I have like all my courses on my site are all free and also available with no login is for that purpose.
(1:19:14) And it's certainly been a significantly better thing than me trying to hide it behind even an opt-in wall uh just to collect people's emails. Um you can watch them and then at the halfway point or whatever it just says, "Hey, you can opt in if you want. You can also not opt in and keep watching the video." Yeah. Um and it's been exceptional for lead generation and um so the thing one is that uh I I don't think a lot of I think the utilization is not as high as I would like it to be.
(1:19:35) Um even when you make these really high-end things. The second is that it certainly doesn't drive I think that you will drive more not you but like one anybody can drive more sales with making the media available to everyone. It also makes it more sharable. Um and I think that spins the referral machine. You get the media machine from platforms.
(1:19:53) Um and then that will drive top offunnel sales and awareness. Um and I think that maybe you put a handful of them behind a pay wall if you want to as a as a membership benefit. I'd be curious to know if because if we're thinking about like how do we solve the problem? Sorry, this is me like like how do we solve the problem of the customers I have bank too much meat and don't cook it because they're not inspired enough to cook.
(1:20:18) So it's like okay so we want we're trying to maximize on consumption in two ways. Consumption of meat but consumption of meat cooking so that it leads to consumption of meat. Yep. Right. And so if you were to pre-educate, right, where people watch some show about some truffle meat dish and then purchase, they're purchasing with intention to make a specific dish.
(1:20:43) And I think it's almost like it it like colors them a different type of customer because their consumption experience was preframed with recipes versus I'm going to buy meat because this is good quality meat and it's a good deal and I'm getting free bacon. Um, just this is me just I'm totally spitballing here, but like that was that was that was when Harley told me that you bought that media business, that was immediately where I guessed or where where I thought you were going to go.
(1:21:08) I was like, "That's that's brilliant." Yeah. Good. Well, push as much of that as humanly possible out. Incorporate the product into everything. Way more eyeballs come in. Existing customers still attribute the benefit of their subscription to the show because they're still going to consume the meat, right? And so you still get the the the positive brand association even if it's free for other people, right? And that was something that actually like I I stumbled upon that. So because I've I've had media businesses, right? And um
(1:21:39) there's always this big fear in anything media related, especially if you have memberships and things behind pay walls, that what if I give away too much for free that I upset my paid customers. But I I in in my experience, it hasn't been the case at all. one because basically no one logs into anything.
(1:21:57) Um as big, you know, big thing, you know, big point number one. Um but secondarily that I think the human brain has a very hard time uh attributing whether the content they watched was behind a payw wall or not behind a payw wall. I think we zoom out and say has Butcher Box provided $129 of value to me this month.
(1:22:21) And you think about the one meal that you cooked, whether from a recipe that you found, whether it was your recipe that was behind a payw wall and not in behind a pay wall or just that they saw on a cooking show and used your meat, right? That wasn't even associated with the um the truffle hustle. Is that what it was? Truffle shuffle. Truffle shuffle. Yeah. Yeah. Um and so anyways, that's that's my that's genius. Two cents.
(1:22:39) Yeah, that's more than two cents probably. That was probably worth more than two cents. I'll come back in a couple years and we'll, you know, I'll cross off the billion. Still won't be enough. But uh yeah, I mean that's um that that's the beauty of owning content is uh pushing it out more, doing more serving our member.
(1:22:58) But I think um that gives me a lot to think about terms of like how are we pushing it to non-members because we've we've definitely been careful. We've been like well this should be a benefit for our members. Yeah. I would just I'd be curious because I think that because there would be because the math problem right is is solvable of does the increase in conversion and retention on members with this added benefit which I'm sure you've measured like now that we added in the box has it measurably reduced churn or has it measurably increased conversion rate on the page whatever um versus the amount of new
(1:23:28) customers that come in with first second third touch point via content. Yeah. And it my bet would be that you would this is my bet obviously I don't know but my bet would be that it'd be more on the on the top end and then from the ads ads perspective because I know you run a ton of advertising I'm sure um it's like I feel like that kind of content taking the because if if you have it public then you can let the algorithm tell you which pieces are the the fire fire pieces of content um of the cooking and then push that out. Yeah. as top ofunnel
(1:24:00) awareness ads, you know, retarget people who are at, you know, do 50%, 75%, whatever it is. Um, with now your conversion stuff, but they have positive brand sentiment because like now they're like they're in they're in the market, you know what I mean? They just consume this.
(1:24:19) They're literally they were watched enough to be inspire they were inspired enough to watch and so now we just want to see if they're inspired enough to buy. Love it. Just love it. Yeah. There's uh there's a book called How Brands Market and what they what they found was they put up all these ads like billboards and stuff trying to get new customers, but they found that it actually drove more repeat orders.
(1:24:39) Um and so that's similar like if we if we put out content to the they'll be reminded to eat their meat. That's right. Right. Is that Yeah, I think that I think it's brilliant and I think that like I'm really excited to see what you do with it. How long ago was the acquisition? Uh we bought it in June of last year or something. Okay. So it's really still pretty recent. Yeah.
(1:24:56) Uh we just launched a spice line with them. We've done a bunch of uh social content. Um but yeah, I think um you know making more of it public would probably be a good thing. Yeah, I think be interesting. Um and so uh the the the last piece was the ad strategy for Facebook.
(1:25:15) So what do you what's been your thinking process for generating probably the amount of creative I'm assuming? I mean, you've got a pro I mean, yeah, you probably have to put out 50 pieces a day in order to maintain that kind of and you probably have gotten a crash course on running ads if you're the CEO of this business. Yeah. Um, so we've we've gone all sorts of different ways.
(1:25:32) Uh, we have, um, had ad agencies work on our stuff. Um, so buy our ads and, you know, update and whatnot. We've done in in-house. We've gone back and forth. Uh, we're currently outsourced to our ad buying. Interesting. Um, outsource media buyers. Who does the creative? Uh, they do as well. They do the creative. Yeah, we do. We do sell some. We give them guidelines, but they do it.
(1:25:51) The reason why was we weren't moving fast enough. Um, so it had become, as you said, Yeah. become a game of it's like an arms race. You got to like be changing your creative all the time. And we um we noticed that there were multiple multiple multiple meetings to like talk about and obsess about all these things.
(1:26:09) It's like we this this isn't going to work. We can't do this. So, we you know, we made a hard pivot. Um, I imagine at some point we'll come we'll be like, "Okay, we're paying way too much. We need to like do it in house." But the speed, do they charge a percentage of ad spend? Is that Yeah. But so when you're spending a lot, that's a lot of money. Yeah. Um, and that's baked into CAC.
(1:26:30) That's baked into the CAC. Yeah. Yeah. Um, have you you have you done multiple different agencies over time or is it We have I mean there are certain agencies that work well at a smaller size and certain ones that work at a bigger size. Uh we have we haven't been able to grow with like one agency. Okay.
(1:26:47) Um you've had multiple at Yeah. at different times. Uh where we've inst we have one right now. It's not like you have four running for you. Yeah. Got it. Okay. Um and cuz I had a buddy who had a really big company and he had four different agencies working at the same time and he was like yeah the world's big all I need all of them just fully focused.
(1:27:11) And I was like, are you worried about like you know like well yeah it's and that was the kind of the response was just like well there's 300 million Americans like I'm not giving them no one's getting any other access besides like pixel traffic and so they can make their own look likes off of whatever they think is going to going to convert and if there is some overlap there's probably overlap with 10 other thousand companies that are also advertising and so it's more because I think the deficit like the the constraint is more the creative power and mental mental bandwidth and attention and skill than um than really anything else. And
(1:27:40) so like one like one team and you probably know this from the from from the companies or at least you've experienced this the same way I have. Um there's this law I can't remember what it is. Tom Billy talked about it but he basically the square root of every company does 50% of the value creation.
(1:27:58) So it's like you have 100 employees 10 people will do 50% of the value creation. Yeah. And I I like I thought about it I was like that sounds about right. um in terms of like where's the the contribution towards revenue and all that kind of stuff.
(1:28:10) And so when you think about that from from the from the the agency owner perspective, it's like I'm getting these four really good people from this agency on my stuff, but I also want the four really good people from this company and the four really good people from this company. So it was just like a interesting thing. So you have you've have one agency that runs all of it. They're doing I can't believe they're do they're doing really everything.
(1:28:28) So how like they're going out? I mean we do some stuff internally, but they're going to like So they're like going to farms and capturing stuff. No, we have all that B-roll. Like we have B-roll. We have all that. Um, so they're not they're not really taking any they're not going all the way shooting. We have all that content. Um, and uh, yeah, I mean, I think um, Facebook has been a wild place for the past few years.
(1:28:52) It's like either working really well or not working at all. We've also had more competitors come into our space. You know, everyone's copying us. Yeah. everyone's advertising against us, which I think is a good thing, but it's like here's why we're better than Butcher World, you know, and it's it's a different world.
(1:29:09) Um, and you know, I think there's been a lot of conversation about this on Twitter recently around like, um, Facebook is great for retargeting. Somebody comes to your website, True, great. Um, top of the funnel, a little bit harder. Top of the funnel meaning like you're you're exposing your brand to new eyeballs. Um, that's where I think, you know, in order to grow from to just continue the growth, which we have to do, we have to have 12 to 15,000 people a month, like at least. Yeah.
(1:29:40) Um, we just need a lot more top of the funnel awareness. And one of the challenges I've had is uh driving top of the funnel awareness has been really hard. What makes sense for the media acquisition? That's why I like the house like brilliant. Yeah. Yeah. Um, so we've we've done other things like we've we've tried to do a lot of like brand top of the funnel stuff that has not worked.
(1:29:58) I'm hopeful in the media thing. Um, but really we're trying to like get the word out about what we're doing. We're trying to change the industry. Um, but the uh Yeah, Facebook has been I I mean you could see it in our numbers. We were like grow grow and then there was the iOS change in 2021. It's just like Yeah. And then inflation. Yeah. I mean Yeah.
(1:30:18) made for business is easy. Yeah. It's super easy. Super easy. Do it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think that like um focusing on the fundamentals is so important for people. Uh like you broke down the business into like these moments and fundamentals along the way. And um you know, yeah, business is hard.
(1:30:41) It can be really challenging, but if you just focus on the things that matter and know the things that matter, um it can be a lot easier. And I think oh a big this is me just saying from outside perspective I think a big part of the success has also been that like you haven't had a mental option for pulling the rip cord you know um and so when problems come it's like well we're I'm not going anywhere so you just kind of take it one bite at a time you know and I think that when you when it's almost like u in a marriage if you like if divorce is an option in your mind then maybe you don't feel like having the conversation it's like you you're like you know but screw this, right? Um, but
(1:31:16) if it's just never an option and you're just like, I'm I'm in, right? Under that hypothetical guys or premise, then it's like that's the that's the premise that you approach all the problems within the business is like, well, I either die or we keep going. So, we keep going. I'm still alive. Therefore, we will solve these problems one at a time. Yeah.
(1:31:36) Um, yeah, it is really interesting with the top of funnel component. Um, I feel like I feel like the content is the ultimate is the ultimate top funnel because it's the that you know you can harness the algorithm finding all those people because it'll serve the your meat stuff to the people who really want meat. Yeah.
(1:31:53) And you don't have to figure out what like the perfect lookike audience is like they'll do that. Yeah. And then then you have this massive retargeting audience where you can spend the amount of money you're spending now, but it's all warm traffic because you're getting a billion impressions a month on uh on all this all this content being pumped out, which I think is so cool. I think it's I think it was just a brilliant acquisition. Thank you.
(1:32:14) So, no, I'm I'm pumped to see it. Well, um I think I can say on behalf of uh all the entrepreneurs who listen to the game, thank you so much for sharing uh the story of Butcher Box. Busher Box to a Billy uh and beyond. Um but thanks so much, man. Appreciate it. Thank you. Appreciate it. No.
(1:32:32) Hey guys, I hope you enjoyed this uh conversation that I had with Mike. I pretty much just led this as what I wanted to know uh about ButcherBox. And hopefully if you're anything like me, uh you just want to know the business stuff. And so I make all of this content for business owners. And if you like this style of conversation, going deep, breaking down the business, showing some of the lessons, the failures along the way, but really getting tactical, um let me know in the comments. Uh, and I'll I'll do more of it.
(1:32:54) And if you were like, "Hey, this blows."

Transcript:
(00:00) I made 35,000 posts over 40 months and grew a 7.8 million person audience and 3 weeks ago I made six big shifts in my content and I want to show you behind the scenes what we found from those six big shifts with screenshots of the data so that you can use this to make more money in your business and whatever you promote and so the first was we went from edutainment to education so instead of being kind of halfway through to all the way all in on education now that had Downstream impacts in terms of how we packaged how we title things even the
(00:31) number of special effects we have and the purpose of Education as I see is to change behavior and so my point is with this video once I show you the data of what's happened since that change since the we made these six shifts that hopefully or hopefully not we'll see what you decide to do but it will change how you make content to make more money so number one is educa edutainment to education number two is went from for us to for you now when I say for us what ended up happening with the mistakes I made was that I mean unknowingly was
(00:57) that I would be like team what do you guys think about content and so they'd be like hey we should make a video on this hey we should make a video on this and so what end up happening is I started making videos for my team not my ideal customer a business owner and so I actually had a friend come into town and say Hey you know it's weird I actually haven't been paying attention to your content he does about 10 million bucks a year and uh I was like he's like well I guess I'm not really your avatar and I was like who I was like you are 100% my
(01:18) avatar what's going on and so as soon as I realized that I was like oh man he's like it just didn't feel as relevant to me and so I was making stuff for my team rather than my avatar and so if you are somebody who makes content something to be mindful of is your team might not be the type of people you're trying to make content for so just something interesting for me so went from for us our team to for you viewer for business owners number three we went from wide to narrow so Fitness relationships Etc there are wider topics
(01:44) more people are in relationship more people eat food more people trying to lose weight compared to only 9% of people are business owners and so we went much narrower on the topic of like I'm just talking about business because that's what I love talking about too as a side note and so it turns out business owners like it more when I talk about business and I like it more as a business owner so everybody wins at least for me number four is we went from views to revenue now this was key so when you just have views as a metric
(02:05) then you kind of do Chase wider because it was the only real metric we were tracking and we didn't really have anything better at the time and that's we focused on since then we've transitioned to ad revenue and here's why ad Revenue takes into account views but it has a second metric that's paired with it which is RPMs which is revenue per thousand eyeballs so if you if YouTube pays lots of money for the eyeball then it means they're more valuable and if they're more valuable to The Advertiser they're more valuable to
(02:28) me and so my idea here is that I want to make sure that we're showing our videos to the right people or rather that the right people are watching now once we can control for that and we stay our keep our RPMs or the amount that advertisers are willing to pay for these eyeballs High then we get as many views as we can and as a total Pro tip for business stuff in general paired kpis Works exceptionally well so if you're in customer success you want the speed of resolution but you also want a quality metric if you had a a company that did
(02:54) cleaning it' be the same thing is you'd pair reviews from customers with the number of cleans per day and so you like to have both edges so that you can control for both sides and you should do that with any Department you can now so I said number four was views to ad Revenue as our primary metric that we were optimizing for so we no longer care oh this one had a lot of views we don't care about that it's just do we have as many views with the right people number five is from emphasizing shorts to emphasizing Longs we saw that longs got
(03:20) the best people and short the whole thesis around shorts creates Longs viewers we actually haven't seen any evidence that supports that people watch shorts want more shorts people want Longs want more longs which doesn't necessarily mean that people from a different platform don't watch you on shorts on Tik Tok and then they're a long form YouTube Watcher and then watch your stuff on YouTube that long but usually people who watch long form stuff on YouTube watch long form stuff on YouTube people watch short form on
(03:46) YouTube watch short form some people watch both but most of the time people kind of have consumption preferences and they're not going to change the preferences for you they just might watch you in a different place where that consumption preference is what you make and so we found that and we found that the Longs are the things that actually drove the the most applications for acquisition.
(04:03) comom and the most Book Sales and the most optins so that's what we're making more of and number six was assuming more versus assuming nothing meaning I made videos like the Alex Heros diet I made uh the the Alex Heros Vlog the herois things like that those assume that somebody who doesn't know me will want to care what whoever the hell Alex rosi is which I don't think is that reasonable like I don't think they would want that cuz who cares about this random dude and so it's assuming nothing now that has um changes in terms of what
(04:33) we're making so there's no assumptions so for example like we own acquisition. comom we have pfolio businesses I introduce myself because if you don't know who I am this might be the first video you see me and so if I stopped doing that for a while because I kind of went into this mindset that every everyone knew now obviously that's dumb way more people don't know me than know me but you kind of fall into this trap of assuming you're talking to your warm audience rather than what you're making the content for which is people who've
(04:57) never met you before and so keeping that top of mind which is that we want to make sure that we welcome everyone and that we don't have inside jokes that only people who are on the inside feel it because then all it does is it excludes people that are new and like what you want to do is bring more people into your world anyways especially if they're business owners for me and so there are the six changes that we made in our content and so we've gone all in on that concept and so we've done a lot of Rapid iteration but let me tell you
(05:21) the data that's happened since so right off the bat RPMs meaning the revenue per thousand viewers went up by 68% so like when you think man I don't feel like I can like what my content is about like it doesn't change anything well it sure as hell did for us when I talk about deep business stuff when I talk about reducing TR when I talk about increasing number of time like ways to get someone to buy more times when I talk about how we scale a 40 person sales team and the all the steps that we did in order to do that in a real case
(05:49) study in a real business when I talk about how you can deconstruct and reconstruct a brand these are a deeper business Concepts and guess what business owners watch them and guess what those eyeballs are more valuable 68% and we're only going to get better at it and so for us boom that meant that US changing our topics got the right people to watch the videos checkbox one and so you can see by the video title when we had educational versus kind of wide or business education versus wider topics The Wider topics in general had
(06:17) way lower RPMs you can see that with the the light blue whereas the purple is more money-making more business more sales more more you know retention real business tactics that grow companies and those unsurprisingly were way higher in average RPM some of them even higher than that so the next big change and I see this as anecdotal is that 25% more comments per view and so I see that as an engagement metric that we had way more people saying wow this was good or this was great or I missed this style of content that's actually a really common
(06:46) thing and I will say this this is to my this my decrement I should have seen that more business owners were telling us in the comments what they wanted and honestly I just wasn't listening um and that's on me I I was like well you're going to lose some people as you make more you know high production stuff that's okay but with the return to hardcore business education in terms of the content that we're making the response has been overwhelming that so many people were like I'm coming back to all your content this has been great
(07:16) this is what I came here for and so I'm stoked about that and so we got 25% more people who are uh doing that we have more shares negligible and slightly fewer likes which again whatever but for me I would say com I would rate comments and shares as higher and so overall we had higher engagement from these videos even though they were narrower topics which to me is more good for fewer people than a little bit of good for a lot of people which is where I want to be in terms of what I want to serve or who I want to serve so the next big
(07:43) change is that despite and this is a key Point despite having fewer absolute views per long form video we're actually getting more long form views overall across the channel so we're up 30 almost 30% 29.56 per um then our our six weeks average before that from these deeper educational videos now realistically that's a function of one main thing in my opinion that's because the education stuff actually requires far less post editing and I can make more education stuff because this is what I do every day and so we can
(08:16) actually create more content which I'm stoked about and I think the I think I mean hopefully business owners are too um and so we actually get more overall views with the right people because we don't have nearly as much highi post production whizbangs which is what most of my audience who was trying to learn stuff rather than be entertained was happy about all right this next one is very surprising to me at least so our subscriber conversion increased by 24.
(08:46) 6% and so that means that we've actually like even though again we had slightly lower lower absolute views more long form views that we actually increased the absolute number of subscribers per week since doing this so like I mean I was very very comfortable with all of these metrics tanking like that was I honestly expected that because I was like all right well we're going to have way fewer viws but it's going to be the right people but because 25% more people who watch subscribe even though we get fewer views our actual subscriber growth has grown which is
(09:17) crazy in an absolute metric way so this was this was an unexpected outcome for me and has just reinforced that this was the right decision for the audience that I want which is business owners the next thing is like okay well if you're getting fewer views how is that going to translate to optins because I'm a business owner like that's what I care about I care about people who are trying to uh to become portfolio companies come to a workshop whatever and so it turns out that we have 26% more optins per week since making
(09:46) this change and so this is like both incredibly surprising and also incredibly duh and I say this because like saying hey I'm going to make business owner stuff to get more business owners duh but at the same time I'll would say this just me kind of commenting on a lot of the Educators that are in the space they tend to start moving more and more broad more and more wide more and more entertainmente more and more topics that they don't necessarily have expertise on because they seek the views whether they say it
(10:11) or not they don't want to say they like likees saying cash they still kind of Count Their likes and so I think if you can just absolutely get your logic head on which is tough because sometimes you it's it's tough to to go away from those vanity metrics but I care about the bottom line and so the right people were seeing it and the right people were taking action and so we in in the the business sense saw growth from this in a big way and this is just like 3 weeks in four weeks into this kind of execution all in on this strategy and this will
(10:39) compound and so for the don't know I have two bestselling books on Amazon they're still like number one and number two on marketing and sales and they've been there for like number one and number two for two years or three years or whatever how they've been out so they're pretty strong and so we sell books every month no matter what but what was crazy to me was to see this jump in Book Sales that happen as like think about this we're getting fewer View use but more sales by a lot like 2x the sales twice not like 20% twice the sales
(11:10) of books that I have and mind you by the way if you're like hey I'm poor I get it my books are free too they're by like you can go to a.com and you get the video course all my stuff for free you don't have to opt in and you can go uh on my podcast and you can listen to the audiobook for free all right like this stuff's free this isn't how I make my money but it's a really good leading indicator for me of the quality of traffic now if you want to get a physical copy yes there's printing cost and there's shipping cost so yeah you
(11:34) pay some bucks but if you're dead broke poor you can use the free stuff the point is is that this attracted the right people people who want because if I make a fitness meals video guess what those people don't care about getting leads and making offers kind of sounds obvious when you think about it when I make a hey this is how I work with Lila my wife maybe you get somebody who's like what about the married entrepreneurs it's like well only 9% of people are business owners and then of that 9% how many of them are married to
(11:59) to their partner percentage or percentage versus just talking about business stuff business people want to get more leads make more offers make more money and so that's what my books are about and so lo and behold more of those people bought now I want to be super clear I want to show these two these two Keynotes here so there are some Keynotes that will be both deep and wide and as a content creator business owner slash investor slash husband slash human being anyway boy big um sometimes you hit it out the park and you actually
(12:33) get both so my highest revenue revenue perview video also happens to be my most viewed video and so it doesn't necessarily mean that if you have a lot of views the RPMs are low no not at all you can get a video that applies to all business owners and it will get a lot of views and the cpms or the RPMs will be high The Branding video is the same thing that it's very recent it's new and it continues to climb up um and there both of these are very conceptual business Concepts that all business owners can benefit from and so if I talk
(13:08) about leverage almost all businesses need to understand strategy and leverage it applies it's a huge amount of value to business owners understanding brand tremendous value to any business now on the other hand you can also make and we have we call these Keynotes but like longer form either whiteboard presentations or like a presentation that I put a lot of time into um some of them are going to be deeper and less wide and that's okay like if I talk about scaling a 40 person sales team if you have an e-commerce store doesn't
(13:33) affect you but leverage and brand would affect you whether you had the 40 person sales team or the e-commerce company or a software company or an app or whatever and so again the scaling for 40% sales team still super valuable but it's just going to be only you know valuable to onethird of the business owner audience that I might be able to you know who might want to watch this same thing with um same thing with the video I've made about texing your business overnight by using using Mega influencers basically
(14:01) showing how to get a Mr Beast A Logan Paul a rock to partner with a Conor McGregor a Huda Beauty a Taylor Swift to partner with to 10x your business now if your business like a local business the likely that they're going to partner with you is really low right and so it doesn't really make sense for that particular business now you could use that on a micro scale but it might just not have as much transference if you have an e-commerce brand that's National might make a ton of sense but again it's going to have a sub segment of already a
(14:28) 9% slice of the population that it would be deeply valuable to though and so that's the thing is is that I have to think about like I'm okay with a video that gets 10,000 views instead of 400,000 views if 10,000 of those people are $10 million plus business owners it's like here here's how I packed my company in order to sell it I have a video on my channel that walks through 46 minutes of the decision-making process I used to determine to sell my business guess who that applies to basically no one unless you actually
(14:56) have a lot of money and you already have a business asset that is5 million in profit or more and so let's see 9% of businesses it's like .1% do $10 million a year of businesses so there's like no one who that actually applies to except for those people or like this thing was amazing this changed my life and I had a bunch of people after I posted that that I know that were big 20 30 $40 million year business owners who watched the video like this is insane I can't believe you gave this out I'm like believe it because guess what no one
(15:25) else is going to watch it and so I will say this this is me giving you like a little hat tip for consuming if you're a business owner I would not gauge views as whether the whether the video is good or not it just shows how relevant it is to how many people and so if you an e-commerce person I have some videos in here about how to use offers for e-commerce that's just already going to be a slice of a slice but it'd be super applicable for you and so I'm okay with very small views as long as the quality gives value and provides a result result
(15:59) in a clear way for the viewer and so I Define education as change of behavior so if I can help them change their behavior in a way that makes them more money ideally they'll associate that money they made that value they made with us at acquisition. comom and so that's the whole goal of this stuff and for the creators out there or those of you guys who are making content in order to promote your business I'll give you this Frame that I started out with that helped me a lot which is you know when I posted my first you like I started at
(16:26) zero on every platform to be very clear here like it wasn't like I was tailor Swift and I came on Tik Tok yay right it wasn't like that when I started on YouTube I had no subscribers and the First videos I posted got like a hundred views right but I thought to myself I was like man if I like I would probably go across town to speak to 100% audience for lunch and I'd have no problem with that and so the idea that I had a hundred people I was like that's not bad even if there's 10 people I'm like well I would talk to a 10 person I mean I
(16:52) used to do this for years I would do a lunch and learn and uh see if I could sell some weight loss you know what I mean like I was willing to do that anyways and so there's this it's be it's literally just because of comparison that people feel bad about their social media content not because inherently the numbers don't make sense and the crazy thing about this and I just want to reemphasize is it's free it's free the platforms distribute your content for free these are people that would never found out about you and
(17:16) they find out about you for free like take that in for a second so the leverage on free distribution is infinite and so if you get a thousand people over a month who see your thing it's a thousand people it's not nothing and so I try to make sure that I focus on that concept of like oh man my average for the channel is 400,000 and we got a 50,000 view video 50,000 my God I speak at conferences with a thousand people it's 50 times that not bad and those people I got to have a really really curated experience increase the
(17:48) value per second absolutely Crush as much value as I possibly could in that in time period And so I'll make one last note on uh on the Deep versus wide content is that I get get so many DMS and like slack messages even from our portfolio company Founders who were like dude that last video was so sick and I hadn't had that in a minute for probably the the six months where we went a little bit wider with our content and it became so reinforcing for me even though like what's the what's the number of people I don't know 50 people maybe
(18:19) messaged me being like dude that new like your new content style or going back like the new old content of more whiteboard more deep business tactics like it's so great my team's watching it again that like fills me up CU that's why I made the stuff to begin with was the stuff that I didn't have when I was coming up that I wish someone had taught me and then I had to just find out through trial and error and so that's why we make this stuff but the views weren't high but for me like I'm here for business owners and I already know
(18:46) there's only 9% of people are business owners and that's okay I'm for I'm here for you guys all right so here's what we're doing next with this data all right so we had our hypothesis we looked at the 35,000 posts we made these six big shifts and buy and large we have crushed the hypothesis so I'm actually like I was telling my team yesterday I was like we're kind of lucky that this worked out the first time because like I'm not really used to things working out the first time more more like realistically like hey we made this
(19:11) change and then like four of the six stats are bad and two of them are good and so we're like all right well these ones are good so let's try and keep this stuff the same and we got to tweak all these other things our view to subscriber ratio is higher our absolute subscribers are higher optins are higher book sales are higher applications are higher and it's about stuff I like making so I'm like I'm thrilled to I'm stoked and I get to make this stuff about like we can do more content because I don't have to put as much post
(19:34) into it for you guys so like you guys said it's more distracting to have the whizbangs and the effects and we're like cool I'm happy to just talk business so this is what we're doing now so one big belief we have is volume NE Gates luck that's in the sales team locker room same thing in the media team is that we will we will create more and we will just basically have constraints on where like the direction of what we're creating but we will keep we will keep as much as we can in different ways to find out works even better than our
(20:03) first whack at it the second thing is don't get the same scar twice we're super happy to make mistakes I mean I I it's funny I even I I I almost mean that like it's totally fine making mistakes it's like they're not mistakes they're just lessons what we don't want is to get the same scar twice and so if we find out or we know that I have to introduce myself then I better keep introducing myself if we know that high Hi-Fi production doesn't do as well with business owners then I better not do that right unless there's a conclusion
(20:36) that we find that's wrong about that but for now like that's what we're not going to make the same mistake twice and so I'm happy to make all the mistakes there are in a very narrow field that's what makes an expert um but I just don't want to make it twice a third one this is super tactical is that uh slides versus just me heavily prepping for a presentation hasn't made as much of a difference so I tried to approximate this by like my best videos that were most views and most business Centric in terms of cpms was me presenting at a
(21:03) conference so I have a stage in my headquarters and so I was like all right I'm going to present on my stage but it was to it was not to an empty room it was to my to my team but like a lot of comments were like is this guy pretending to be on stage and so if you did see that that's why it was uh that's why the the room was kind of empty um but I was like I was trying to approximate as much of that style of video so that gives you maybe a little bit Insight I was like okay what can I control I can do a stage we can do the
(21:27) lighting we can have the seats I can have slides these all things that I'm used to doing now it worked to degree but we got the same performance from me just talking to red camera like this and going over the slides without the stage uh or me just doing whiteboard of walking through the concepts or the tactics to grow or solve a problem number four show what only you can show and say what only you can say and so I have I have a few marketing isms that I have never heard anywhere else that are like very real for me one is State the facts
(21:55) and tell the truth it's always that way because then you never get in trouble you have to worry you don't have to worry about claims you just State the facts and tell the truth also means that you have to go collect data so you can State the truth um and so a second one underneath of that is say what only we can say and show it only we can show it's demonstration right and so if obviously I have accomplishments that I can say hey I know what I'm talking about but there's also labor and so I could say hey I built a 8 million
(22:21) personal audience listen to this stuff for Content which by the way you don't have to listen to any of it this just worked for me um or I can say I made 35,000 posts independent of the outcome and so what I want to do is do more work than anyone else will do so that I can show what no one else can show and say what else can say and so if you're starting out or you're you're a different part in your journey considering like okay well I can't out outcome anyone yet because I'm early but you can outwork people and so I can just
(22:49) say like I made 35,000 post what I learned I'm going to compress a lot of time for you that's valuable no matter who you are and number five is still doing wide shorts so this is interesting so we thought about this and we decided that for shorts we're willing to go a little bit wider and I'll tell you why so I run ads and Lila runs ads using our face and I actually see the main Roi from shorts as top of funnel brand awareness and when I say brand awareness I really just mean like facial recognition people will
(23:21) see my face and remember that they got some sort of value from it and in a short it's more difficult to get into really deep business Concepts which is what I'm um not to stes Impossible and maybe I just need to up my skills which is totally totally fine um but we're still maintaining a certain percentage of shorts that I would consider to be more like um a little bit wider because I tend to like business philosophy too and I don't want to stop like one are the things I like talking about I like philosophy I like wide business Concepts
(23:49) I like personal development instead of in terms of like productivity which is T of kind of a wider topic but I'm not going to stop doing that because I do like making that stuff and so I'll probably keep having shorts around that because the ROI is actually not from shorts turning into book sales or shorts turning into optins it's actually the shorts getting retargeted later with an ad that does go to something but they're going to be more likely to recognize me and then take the next step in whatever whatever the funnel is
(24:17) whether we're saying hey if you're starting a business go check out school which by the way again wide if someone's trying to start a business then it makes sense for it to be a little bit wider for people trying to get into it and so then the school ads can hit those people and it makes sense for them to use school right uh if it's a business owner I still think that from a business perspective we have a lot of business content in terms of our shorts but I want to just address this in case you see it so you're not confused about it I
(24:42) still will have some wide content in short form um because of the reason that I just said and so those are the kind of like the next steps and if you guys find these kind of updates valuable with the metrics behind it um the tldr of this whole video is that what we said worked and if you're an educator toss out the views focus on your customer make stuff for them because likes ain't cash views ain't cash cash is cash and so if you're trying to grow your business make sure you're making the stuff for the people you actually want
(25:16) to make now here you go

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on everyone uh happy tuesday um i hope you're having a phenomenal day whatever day it is that you're listening to this um i had a lot of requests um from instagram and dms and thank you for those uh for the 2020 lessons and failures uh so this will be a sequel to my 2019 lessons and failures which if you haven't listened to that one i think uh my my year-long recaps are i think some of my better ones um but it's obviously up to you so this one will probably a little longer than what you're used to um and that's because trying to summarize what i learned in a year is
(00:39) hard in one episode and so for those who don't know uh i i keep an ongoing email thread to myself um consistently consolidating uh 2020 lessons and failures so you can well maybe you can't see it on the thing but it's there all right and so i have this big thread that i just continue to email myself whenever i feel like i learn a lesson and so i will do my very best to tell you each of the lessons that i learned and how i learned it and 2020 was a was a packed year of lessons for me and so uh where to start um
(01:27) where okay well from the 500 you know million dollar mastermind i learned a lot um from there i really learned about scale and seeing the people that were doing more than me all were going after bigger markets so there's really two options for me to do that within the context of gym launch one is go after find alternative and additional channels uh to grow the business because you know it's not like we've sold 100 of gyms and so that means that i have to find new ways to reach them so if my traditional advertising methods
(02:08) obviously you know you can exhaust a platform especially if there's a niche it's usually much bigger than you think it is but you may you may not have reached every single person on that platform but you may have reached every person that you could reach on that platform profitably um so that's kind of the the differentiation and so uh for me seeing all these people who are doing more than me and i was you know providing value to them in a lot of ways and i it's always like it's been a consistent effort of mine to try and understand if there's anyone who makes
(02:39) more money than me what it is that they have or what it is that i have that they do not have um because sometimes the question is not this is an interesting one for you that i've learned also is it's not always good to say uh what does this person have that i don't sometimes it's what do they lack that i have and i think oftentimes it's more frequently the case which is why it's always backwards which is why i think the learning process is interesting and so uh you know champions beat normal people at their endeavor not
(03:07) because they have something the other person doesn't but because they lack the ability to stop working they black the off switch and so i think sometimes not only thinking what do they have but what do i have that's limiting me rather than what do they have that's giving them an advantage over me so first off just even switching my thought process to thinking that way has been a lesson of 2020 um for me from an entrepreneurial perspective before i go any further i'll just say this so that you know i'm supposed to keep things interesting during these
(03:36) podcasts so we hit our 100 million dollar amount in 2020 which is kind of weird so just to clarify this for anyone the reasons i didn't put it on this award yet is because uh i'm not very handy with things and i'll probably mess it up so i'll have someone else do it um but just for transparency that means i've done 100 million in total sales in the last three and a half years um and so we did we did 30 we did 28 million and we did 7 million in in in 2016 we did 28 million in 2017 in 20 2018. we did uh 37 million in 2019
(04:17) and uh in 2020 i think we finished at 31. uh we're still getting the final books for this year um but yeah so that was you know that's the that's the deal that's how we we hit 100 million so it's not like i did 100 million in 2020 just for full transparency because i think some people thought that that's not what it was um but i made a podcast about how uh i i've been stuck at 30-ish million for three years and i finally figured out what i need to do to fix it and among those is hiring really good talent
(04:50) uh that is one another one and that sounds like so like duh alex but i feel like it's so many times the lessons that i learn are not like nothing's novel like nothing's novel it's just at what point does we call them singed moments but at what point does something that you've heard your whole life become real for you you know um for some of us it's like be kind to others or something you hear your whole life but maybe some moment or some event triggers that for you and you're like maybe i should be kind to people and then you start changing the way you live um
(05:21) and so for me uh you know i've always heard niche down i think it's important to niche especially when you're starting um but you will eventually be constrained by that niche uh but that being said if you're like i get this one all the time from our clients which is like man i got my niche is too small and like homies doing like 500 grand a year i'm like your niche is a six billion dollar industry and you think that you doing half a million dollars a year somehow tapped that niche you just have such a poor business model that your lifetime value of a customer is so
(05:54) low that you can only profitably reach a half i mean like a quarter of a quarter of a quarter of a percent of your market so it's really important to delineate between am i capping my niche or are the economics behind my business model stifling my ability to scale and grow profitably i think those are two very different things and everyone just likes to say likes to point outwardly because it's easier to say oh my niche is small rather than saying saying no my my business model sucks and i have no way of profitably reaching these people
(06:26) which either means you need to fix your business model or you need to find alternative or additional acquisition channels and so for us i think we have a we have a i don't know of a lot of businesses that have higher ltv from from you know micro gym owners than us and that's candidly because we provide more value than everyone else does in the marketplace that is why you get rewarded and so uh i mean i always i'm trying to expand ltv provide more value find ways that we can you know solve problems um and i i will always continue to do
(06:55) that but given the numbers that we have um the le one of the lessons of 2020 is expanding additional acquisition channels and so we were able to build an outbound acquisition channel in 2020 so that was um uh really cool and the additional part of what made that cool for me was that i actually had someone else own the entire process and end so when i talk about hiring high level talent it's really for me transitioning from the what to the who and you've probably heard that before but on some level it became real for me and the
(07:25) obsessive nature of the entrepreneur of wanting to learn how to do everything is absolutely required in the beginning but as you scale up it is more about finding the who but the thing is is that in the beginning you think too soon you need to find the who when in reality you still need to learn the things that make the business work and so i think that's why context and timing is so hard with these things because we have to find like when i'm trying to give you know advice it's you know you have to take it within like your current paradigm and i understand that that's
(07:54) difficult and that's why sometimes it's hard listening to billionaires because it's like their paradigm of of what's happening what is what are the successful actions for them right now in their in their current chapter is different than somebody who's at zero or at a hundred thousand dollars a year and so i'm going to try and cater this as broadly as i can with as much you know contextual points as possible so uh number one adding additional channels number two focusing on who not what and specifically high value who and my picker my ability to judge
(08:26) the quality of talent has increased i think i've gotten better at it i was not nearly as good at it years ago and i don't know how you learned that without experience so that is that is something um try and find people with pre-loaded solutions so as a caveat to that that's one of my lessons which is like i've i've now found people who come pre-loaded with solutions they come batteries included you know i'm like hey here's my problem i can point them at it and they're like oh this is all the things we need to do because i've already done this three
(08:55) times i'm like got it yes please go do that and you know as a as a correlator to that my role within the company i would say in 2020 transitioned from being a ceo to being investor slash owner slash stakeholder shareholder whatever way you want to say it but really i would say for the first time in 2020 i really transitioned to being above the business um not in like a weird arrogant way just like not truly being out of it and so i think there's definitely levels to being out of it you know first you're uh you own your own job right you're
(09:31) self-employed and that's just you doing things for other people for money you just someone else is paying you and you're doing stuff you know above that you start becoming a manager and managing other people right and then above that you become a leader and then above that in my opinion you become an executive right which is like leading organizational change in departmental change around objectives that are going to protect the business or grow the business right and i think the level above that is where i i feel like this year i was able to get to i could be wrong
(10:02) we'll find out in 2021 lessons and failures but i right now i'm not i don't actually do anything um in the business besides meet with two leaders a week um and really advise on the ways that we can strategically improve the business and provide more value and so that's really the majority of my time is like looking at the overall marketplace and thinking like how can we provide more value in a strategic way to everyone right and what are of the many ways what is the one thing that we're going to focus on and so i think 2020 was also a really uh
(10:42) humbling year for me because uh we got to refocus on the few things that provide the most value and so for us it's we need to get jim's leads because that's what everyone wants uh we need to make gyms more money because that's what everyone wants and that's about it you know pretty much any other you know endeavors that are not focused on those things uh are kind of a waste uh as much as you know people may need to have better retention tactics better um you know better profit margins and we talk a lot about that whenever we do talk about that we lose people who lose interest because entrepreneurials most
(11:19) entrepreneurs that i serve um only think about revenue right the only thing about growth um rather than what am i taking home you know how much risk am i exposed to that kind of stuff and i think that just comes with time but i will practice what i preach and not sell what i want to sell i will sell what they want to buy and so that is uh how you know we've we've cut a ton of excess out in 2020 in the business and so uh really focusing on a handful of key priorities um has been really useful and interestingly
(11:49) i think the business has actually improved since i've moved further away from it because i tend to break things a lot because i want to fix it till it's broken if you know what i mean and so giving our leadership space to just transact you know run the business has been um really valuable and i think it's actually been i think it's been better for the business overall so uh those are some of uh my my initial list i've got a whole bunch so i'm just gonna keep going through this so one of the next ones was um i was talking to brooke castillo she is
(12:19) an amazing business uh good friend of mine uh if you've heard of her life coach school podcast uh check her out she's an amazing pod she's a huge following um and she didn't say this directly but like the the term that came into my mind was scale skill zero and simple scales and or zero scales i'll have to come up with something catchy for that but basically the reason that i had to be get into the you know quote in investor or owner type role i believe is because if i am involved in any really day-to-day activity
(12:56) i will become the bottleneck right and it's not a bottleneck of communication which is what happens when you are the manager as a bottleneck but as as as somebody who even provides value in any way if it requires you to be there to provide the value then as soon as the team grows outside of you providing that value if it cannot grow without you providing whatever that value is then it will stop there and so i think that's 2020 was really my transition of of moving above that and so i think that was kind of the win for the year um and so that was kind of one of the lessons that i learned is is you have to
(13:31) scale zero like i have to get myself to doing nothing and still have the company make money and grow and be profitable etc in order for us to be able to grow beyond where we're at and i think that's much easier said than done especially because a lot of companies start because the entrepreneur is skilled in a certain way or has a variety of skills which is usually what happens we have a stack of skills which is why you know why we start growing and then somehow you have to in the beginning inextricably you know or intrinsically link yourself to every aspect of the business is what makes it grow and then
(14:06) piece by piece peel off each of these skills and traits and and things that you don't even know you do in the business to keep it moving and that's taken time and it's and it's taken trial and error and it's been uh difficult but ultimately rewarding um because now right now it's i would say like one day a week is focused on all my leadership meetings um and that's it and then beyond that it's just strategic insight on monthly and quarterlys so um that's given me a lot more time to really focus on the industry and how we can and help overall
(14:36) rather than being kind of like in the in the tactics um next one um i have this belief and it just continues to be reinforced that see if you can just keep growing and not hire people um we have had uh i mean all you gotta do is look at our our atrocious glass door reviews um which stock uh to know that like we have we hire fast um we've had a tendency to hire fast and fire fast so we have followed that mantra um but i and the thing is is part of the difficulty of having a business that that grows quickly is um or has any level of volatility month to month is that you have these waxing
(15:23) and waning demands for labor right and so it's like you need five people and then the next month you don't need the five people anymore and uh you know i'm not saying we hire five people and then let them go it's more that like that consistent variability uh can be annoying from uh from a payroll and labor standpoint and what's unfortunately happened many many times is we'll bring people on we will solve the problem and then they won't and it really should be like you know for defined periods of time you know like project based and whatnot um the problem will be solved and after we let
(16:03) the people go the business grows more and that's kind of weird and backwards for me as an entrepreneur and so i'm going to just try and make sense of it out loud with you um but i kind of have this belief that only one out of five employees in a company is providing value like i i actually like kind of believe that uh kind of the 80 20 people are fractal um i just can't like i just the amount of times that we've literally gotten rid of like a department because it's just like we we created a department for example to solve a problem let's say it was churn and provide value in all these
(16:40) ways to solve churn and then after scaling that after six months realizing that churn is completely unaffected and we just took 20 more employees on and then having just be like well guys you didn't solve the problem and as much as you're doing stuff it doesn't it's not doing anything right and so then we have to you know let people go because it is a business and um and then and and then just realizing that the business literally doesn't change at all like revenue doesn't change return doesn't change profit doesn't change well profit goes up
(17:11) and that's it and it's just like it's mind-blowing to me it's like there are so many people especially as your organization grows that you're like this person was totally unnecessary and that's crazy because from the employee perspective it's like how can you do that and i understand that perspective but on the flip side as the owner you're like man this this person was 90 000 a year like people are afraid of signing up for a mastermind and yet will or hire an employee for 50 000 a year without even thinking about it and it's just like which of these things is providing more value you know what i mean and so that's that's something
(17:42) that's been like mind-blowing to me is is seeing a company grow after shrinking it's like it's crazy and it's happened so many times and it happened twice in 2020 for us where i would get rid of a key team or a key you know series of individuals who are doing a role that we we were tracking metrics on and we kind of implemented it into to provide a solution and then it and then disappeared right and because the solution like it did not solve the problem and therefore was not providing the value that it was supposed to and so
(18:10) people were essentially cutting grass with scissors which doesn't they're doing stuff but it doesn't mean it's for it's being valuable right and so um i am now really trying to add the constraints to i want to see if we can grow with no people like how can we look at berkshire hathaway right how can we look at warren buffett who has 19 employees and runs a gigantor you know company how can we find fewer smarter people that are pre-loaded with solutions like i said earlier but it's like i'm just trying to hit this in
(18:40) multiple ways because it's it's really ingrained in me this year how important having an a player is compare like one a player literally does more work than 5b players it's crazy like most people actually do nothing like it's it's it's crazy like most people don't do anything and and and that's why they can't progress i mean like as a tangential side story you know i i there's a guy that i've seen in a mastermind this is an entrepreneur right and he's uh you know he's like hey you know and this is three years ago when i met him he was like yeah i'm gonna start running facebook ads and i was like
(19:15) awesome fantastic like that's a great idea and because his biggest issue was that he couldn't get legion right sorted and i saw him at an event three years later and i was like hey man how's it going you know how's the business whatever and uh he was like yeah just you know we're gonna start we're gonna we're definitely gonna start facebook ads soon and i was just like bro it's been three years like what are you doing you're like what are you like what are you doing you know what i mean like you it's just it you know what i mean there's different it's different for me if someone's like
(19:48) trying to figure out what the obstacle is versus knowing what the obstacle is and not doing anything about it that's that's the one that kind of drives me nuts and so i was like dude if you literally spent one day and just googled how to run a facebook ad you would be able to run a facebook ad by the end of the day like this is not a quarter-long solution like do it you know what i mean and so i say that to say a lot of people think they're productive when in fact they are busy and actually do nothing um and i don't know if it's it's their fault or whatever but um that is just an
(20:17) observation that i've had and seeing the company become more profitable and grow even while we contracted resources is um sadly uh reassuring or reaffirming and so it's just like you probably know if you're in a company of any size that like there's like a handful of people that you know that everybody knows because those are the people who move right like they're people in our company that i don't know who they are and i don't know their names and i'm like whoop they're like oh we let go of kelsey and i'm like who's kelsey and then now i've kind of
(20:49) been like well if i don't know their name that's why they got let go because if you're doing something i will hear about you they're like oh yeah this new girl in blah blah is killing it right i'll hear about it but if i'd never hear your name it's because you're not doing anything so anywho that's uh that's another one of the lessons i told you this would be a longer one and probably more encapsulated ah okay next one oh my god data management is has been the biggest mistake or has been has been the thing that i messed up the most in the last three years which is
(21:24) having a really good erp or crm that i run everything dude as properly set up and i this has plagued my business for three and a half years and i think it's actually been one of the things that has kept us um at 30-ish you know a million a year and we we just got hubspot it's expensive i think we pay 36 000 a year for it um but it's worth every penny it's just it's just worth every penny it's it's so funny because we were like man that's so expensive for crm i'm like do you think that the entire system and all the data of everything that you have is worth more than a frontline employee just one
(22:01) do you think it could provide value to everyone in the company disproportionately to one frontline employee well yeah it's like well like think you know think in relative terms um but now we finally are able to track from click to close which has been gosh the hardest thing in the world and if i could start all over again so if you are you know listening to this like invest early in really good data systems like it it will make your life so much easier and like i i genuinely conservatively can say that we've we've left 30
(22:31) probably 30 million dollars on the table over the last three and a half years because of such poor data management and because of our tit systems have been literally the bane of my existence and so now when i start new things or i talk to new companies the first thing i'm looking at is what are using track data what's your crm you know are you on a google sheet you know czar is that how you're running everything great let's put the whole system in place so that's just a huge one that i feel like i now i got the i got the success from that and i've learned from three
(23:01) years of failures and so that was a a really big win for us um next one is uh three businesses you know i uh i shouldn't have three businesses that's uh continued to be a lesson of mine uh because we have prestige labs jim launch and allen it's been very hard for me not from a time perspective but from an attention perspective to split my attention like that um and so i think part of it is this was like a paired lesson in failure is that i think the decision was incorrect but i think that the lesson that i learned from it was it forced me to get out of
(23:36) ceo and into investor owner role and i think that was that was the gift of the curse the curse is that like i now know that i shouldn't do that in the future and so now i'm trying to figure out really how to run these as portfolio companies if that makes sense so that's that's been the hard part um and the thing is you can't like undo something like that you know what i mean i've got i've got you know 100 employees like i can't you know what i mean so that's uh those are those are mistakes that are uh you know
(24:06) jeff bezos says when i'm making a decision there's there's reversible decisions and irreversible decisions starting a company is in some ways an irreversible decision and so um it's not completely reversible but it does you know it it it's it's long and difficult you know what i mean if you want to try and undo that um which is either through a sale or you know whatever um or just winding it down we're trying to like somehow sustain it and systemizes so it stays at a certain level and doesn't require attention is also hard and so anyways that's kind of actually a lot of what i would say i struggled with
(24:38) in 2020 um that i've you know actively been putting solutions together for 2021 i'll let you know how that goes um this is a big one know what your game beyond the game is uh this is a really big one that i've learned in 2020 which is uh you know we've you know my wife and i have made a lot of money uh over the last three and a half years we took 35 36 million dollars out of the business just in direct distributions so that doesn't include like the actual value of the companies um and you have to know what to do with the money and i and i actively i'll tell you the thought process i had behind this
(25:13) which was uh my second year so in 2018 we took home 17 4 in profit uh so it's two years ago and while at that point i said well if i were to get 20 return on my money i would make 3.4 million dollars on the 17 right um so me working on my business makes me 17. so i should just keep working my business and ignore the money but at a certain point the kind of the lost compounding becomes big enough that that it can surpass your regular income and so you know if you look at what twenty percent of you know if if for example i
(26:01) had actively managed it and had thirty million dollars and done twenty percent growth it'd be 30 goes to 36 36 goes to 42 and at that point you're making eight million dollars a year and that's two years three years later right and so uh at some point you have to the opportunity cost of not managing the money becomes bigger um and so and it actually starts to take attention like a lot of my attention is getting drained on the fact that just this gigantic big stack of money that i was like what am i going to do with this
(26:28) thing right i don't want to learn the real estate game i don't want to learn the the you know hard money lending game i don't like there's so many different games for money i don't want to learn the private equity game so i spent probably 30 percent of my year this year on figuring out how to allocate money and i try to allocate them within our companies because those are things i have direct control over and i'll get disproportionate returns on which is you know candidly why i started prestige labs is because i had all this money from gym launch and i was like well what's an ancillary business to what i currently have that can provide value to
(26:56) my customers that i can use the same you know distribution based and shared services on that i can make you know that i can get a disproportionate return on and that's what started prestige labs and now you know two years or two and a half years later prestige labs is a good business it's a it's a real it's a very good business it provides a lot of value we paid over 10 million in commissions um so that's been really good um but it i i don't think it was the correct decision at the time but now that i have it um i am grateful that we have it so that's kind of the
(27:29) long and short of that one um but knowing your game beyond the game because it will it will distract you because what ends up happening is like once you start getting into that world you get sucked into it and then your actual business starts losing your attention that's where your highest return on attention is is inside of your business right is your income and growing it right because both your net worth and the cash flow from your business both of them like it's one of the it's one of the cool things about being an entrepreneur is like the net worth that you have in the equity of
(27:54) your business is usually larger than what you have pulled out of your business actually most times it's larger when you pull out your business and so um that's that's kind of you know interesting uh and so for me uh trying to figure out how to allocate those things has been a priority so before i get the question i'll just tell you this is this is what i have uh invested my money in uh this year uh first we have a a whole life insurance policy cat high catch value up front you have to be really careful
(28:23) about the people that you work with this because they can totally screw you and they are incentivized to screw you and most insurance agents will not want to hear that but they the the commission structure that they have for these policies is insane um it destroys the the cash value that you earn from these things so uh if you decide to set up a whole whole value whole vet cash value whatever insurance policy uh one go with the big four so that's uh guardian new york life northwestern mutual and uh umass or mass mutual excuse me
(28:56) so there's the big four they've been all around for over 100 years you know new york life's been around for 183 years they predate the tax code the reason i did that is because it it basically creates a bank account for you that you can use you obviously pay costs in the beginning but you can basically loan against the the cash value of the insurance um and the cash flow guarantee is you know it's guaranteed growth at about four percent a year and so if you just compare that to a traditional bank account where you're losing money um
(29:26) this at least uh covers for inflation right and so uh that allows you to at least park the money in a way that's not devaluing itself and if you do see opportunities you can loan against it and invest in those things so that's the first thing that we did if you ever do one of those you should be able to break even by year three to five at most if it's designed properly they'll tell you that no that's gonna it's gonna sacrifice the long term blah blah of the of the thing i think that's horse [ __ ] when you when you compare it to the present-day cash
(29:56) like the value of having your money available to co-invest at the same time is it's not even an argument in my opinion uh it's also how corporations and banks uh and fortune 500 companies structure it so ask so look into coley and boli which is corporate owned life insurance and bank owned life insurance if you want to see how they structure it because they know what they're doing and so that is how we structured it so that's number one number two uh we are investing in b and c class multi-family uh apartment units syndication so that's
(30:25) big apartment buildings the reason for that is because i think i think single family might get hit hard in the next few years because i'm looking at like you know seven-year timelines i actually think that i mean who knows i won't even make my prediction because it's there's no point um but i think that that asset class has outperformed other asset classes and if people downgrade their living standards because of some kind of recession because i'm really much more about downside mitigation than i am about getting the upside uh because my upside's in my business so it's
(30:55) really like where can i park money that i know it's not going to go anywhere and so i take inferior returns to know that i have no downside or less downside and so uh parking money in b and c class real estate has been um one of those those places uh through syndicated deals um the third place is uh i have index funds so uh that's uh indexes of the entire market because again this is one of those things that i don't want to think about and i'm not trying to stock pick uh because this is not how i make income like this is not this is the thing that
(31:25) everyone is like man i could get better yeah sure you get better returns if you're a daily trader but you also have a business so are you going to learn that game and be better than the biggest institutions in the world that have you know zillions of dollars to literally destroy you maybe but probably not and so what you can do is be really good at your business and provide good service and probably good value and make more money that way and then be willing to take the non-premium return you know of active
(31:50) management and basically make money on your on yourself twice because you're making money on income doing your thing and you get passive uh from your investments um i have a five percent uh hedge uh in crypto i don't really like speculative things but the only reason i have that is because uh if for some reason the dollar gets devalued and for some reason we lose the world currency that would uh probably greatly appreciate in value and would the reason it's a hedge is that i'm not trying to make money on it i'm only
(32:23) saying that i'm putting five percent there so that if that happens that will probably 5x if that were to occur which would offset the losses i would have in basically the majority of my investments and so um that is my that is the conclusion of my investment strategy um and what i am focused on um outside of just value creation the business because that's actually the fastest way for me to increase my net worth okay uh next one if you are financially done you must have a bigger purpose so that was one that i learned this year is like um you're like i mean i shared my numbers
(33:00) transparently with everyone um i we need to um like it you have to you have to sound stupid you have to really like what you're doing um and have a purpose beyond it otherwise like the money starts being meaningless and it like it just it doesn't incrementally change my life in any way you know like think think about it like i know this sounds crazy but just like imagine if buying a lamborghini for example was one week's paycheck well what do you do after you buy lamborghini the next week right and let's say you buy a crazy house and that's like five weeks of paycheck well then what do you do with the other 40 you know five
(33:44) weeks of the year's paycheck right like it you know a steak dinner you know like is is not that expensive in the relative term of things like if i ate a steak dinner two times a day or you know went to capitol grill and spent 200 at three meals a day even right that's 200 000 a year um and that is crazy for sure but it's also like within the relative scheme and this is where like uh this is where the ultra wealth part starts to get weird is that like if you have 10 million dollars and you grow by 15 that's a million and a half dollars a year and it gets bigger and that's what's like it's you can't eat it you can't
(34:27) like i still eat chicken and rice like it's not you know be like nothing i eat bagels and i eat the the cheap deli meat from the supermarket like my life hasn't really changed you know i have a nicer camera now there's a thousand dollar camera you know but um you really have to find something that that i'll put it this way i have found that i must do work that i find meaningful and that is what gives me purpose in life is that what i do i find the pursuit of that endeavor meaningful um and the actual process itself enjoyable and so
(35:01) that is one of my my bigger takeaways from 2020. laila and i spent more time together this year than we ever have and man it was um the best thing about this year was my marriage got a lot better not that it was bad but it just like we're just really good and the whole year has been great um which was definitely offset by the craziness of the of the world and i think maybe that's maybe that's why we came even closer together um but really focusing on the marriage has just made my life more enjoyable um even
(35:27) though we actually made less profit this year than we did the last two years um and so yeah that's that's that one um i did make one good decision this year um we actually developed a whole crm for gyms for the same reason bringing up is that you need to have good data management um and i spent a million bucks on this thing and uh i realized that i couldn't have four businesses uh and so i pretty much just killed the project and i just wasted a million dollars so uh i make lots of mistakes just so you're aware uh lots and lots of mistakes um but that was a good that was a good decision the starting it was not a good
(36:03) decision but not doing the business after i had made it uh was a good decision even with the sunk cost which was hard another one is entrepreneurship comes in cycles and seasons there are seasons of heavy work and there are seasons of there's seasons of reaping and seasons of sowing and i think recognizing that there are cycles is really important um and there's even seasonal cycles which sounds crazy but now this is like the fourth year uh for our fifth year you know that we're going into for us and every year i'm always like i feel like january through june i'm like we're on
(36:33) fire you know what i mean and then like by december i'm like we suck and we shouldn't be in business and we're horrible you know what i mean and then like january comes again and then it's like everything explodes and so uh i you know i've now i come to recognize it and i prepare the team for it and i think now that this is like my fourth or fifth cycle through it um i'm more steady and so that's been um i think a lesson in seasonality i was talking to brandon from weighty uh weedy loss ladyboss uh weight loss and he
(37:02) talked about the same thing is that he he and i started around the same time and he realized the same thing is like doesn't matter what we do we are somehow also subject to the cycles of seasonality uh and they always have their you know q1 is always the strongest quarter uh why because people are more motivated in weight loss when they're going into summer going to spring and just started you know i just had valentine's day and new year's eve so there's like all the reasons are all right there um you know
(37:27) once once it's august you know or july it's not usually a huge you know fitness month and you know a lot of my business is correlated to fitness and weight loss so that was that one um ah three year life cycle of products so the average product or service has like a three year life cycle and um you know jim launch has had to innovate it's i would say product suite twice uh so we started with kind of like the whole six week challenge thing um and then we transitioned to kind of higher ticket hybrid bootcamp packages um and right
(37:57) now we actually sell the same packages but the acquisition system is different it's all outbound based uh because that's actually where the biggest arbitrage is right now meaning we can buy leads and get sales basically our roi on time is highest there and so we just continue to see the cycle of you know and you kind of get into these transition points where like a new opportunity opens there's another one's closing and then you kind of have to like readjust the product and jump and that's always just focusing on like what's working best right now another one is having multiple
(38:25) acquisition channels and streams is really valuable now that we have outbound you know like i teach the gyms what i'm doing with my own business uh having outbound has been really nice uh it's it's stable it's much more reliable it's slower for sure to grow it took 90 days to really get it right for us um it definitely doesn't take nearly as i mean for gyms like we already have the whole system but for us to start from scratch and build the whole team and figure out how to find the data because like it's not just trying to find weight loss like a lot of people are overweight not a lot of people are gym owners so
(38:54) there's you know it's different um it's b to c versus b to b but we had to figure out okay where do we find the data how do we clean the data how do we create these lists you know what software do we use to cold call what's the script what's the hook what do we say on the opener how do we train the team where do we recruit from how do we compensate these people how do we set up the sales process is it a two-step or a three-step like all those things are things that we had to figure out from scratch um and it took us about 90 days to figure it out so
(39:18) but now that we have it it's actually really great um and it's just really cool having two things that are really firing side by side between inbound and outbound um i wrote this one again but simple scales and so simple like really trying to figure out at all levels the simplest solution not like oftentimes the best solution is not the best solution because it is more complex and the simplest solution though it might not be the best solution becomes the best solution because it is actually able to be realized and so that is a lesson that i have learned in 2020 more so than any year is like
(39:54) we have made our product suites simpler and more digestible and immediately actionable and we're getting better client results now than even when there was like crazy facebook arbitrage and that took time you know what i mean to just learn that because i would say like a year and a half ago we had so much stuff inside of our product that's like it it could be so perfectly customized the thing is is that it was overwhelming for the majority of clients and so trying to to to rectify the complexity versus simplicity equation uh you know
(40:24) you kind of have to find the the middle ground and the sweet spot for what's going to serve the most people at the highest level and so that was just reinforced this year and honestly right now we're doing we're i'm i'm more proud of the jim launch product now than i've ever been which is pretty cool for me um another one is that you can make the right decisions and be wrong and you can make the wrong decisions and be right and so this is really hard from a learning perspective because let's say for example i bet my life savings on uh black at the at the
(40:57) at the casino right if it hits black was it the right decision probably not and so i may be rewarded for poor decision just like i could make a strategic bet in business that for all reasons was the right call and then covet hits right and then all of a sudden that's not the that wasn't the quote right bet but it was the right decision given the information available and so uh things change there are market dynamics and so i instead of beating myself up over decisions i think if all i had was the the decision-making
(41:37) criteria that i had available to me at the time the information available to me at the time was the decision that i made the best decision and what i don't want to do is unlearn good habits right because we're constantly you know evolving and growing as entrepreneurs and so not unlearning good habits um and and not reinforcing bad habits that have good outcomes uh is is is something that i have focused on a lot this year and so sometimes there are short-term trades that have long-term uh outcomes and i think this year was actually much more of a long-term
(42:07) focused year for us ironically with all the craziness that was going on um we put a lot of foundational stuff in place that i think is really setting the stage for 2021 so pump for that um and i would say my there's there's more to this but i'll i'll probably end on this note which is um understanding an expanded time horizon has been immeasurably valuable for me and this is one of those things where you hear it all the time right um but it doesn't become real for you and i feel like it became real for me
(42:45) this year which was i'm independently wealthy i don't need any more money for the rest of my life if we grow our current net worth at 10 a year will be worth 700 million dollars half a billion dollars by the time i'm 60. and so that probably means i won't need anything i could stop working now right and that allows me to think from a slightly different perspective but the thing is is that i think the reason that the rich get richer is because it allows them to think from this perspective and so the hardest
(43:17) thing is trying to get yourself into this and so i'm making like this is if there's anything that you listen to in this entire video it is what i'm about to tell you if you can expand your time horizon beyond months and even a year or two you will be so much better off if you expand your time horizon beyond just a month or a year and actually start thinking in five year and ten year terms you will be so much better off and i think there's there's so many reasons for that one is when you bet on long enough time horizons you can virtually get rid of risk and if you can make
(43:58) risk fee risk-free guaranteed upside then why would you not make those bets the reason warren buffett said this he said no one wants to get rich slow right but i would rather get rich for sure than get rich fast and lose it right or or more realistically for many try and get rich fast for my entire life rather than just saying well if i just did this for 10 years i'd be guaranteed to be a millionaire and i think that is the issue and i think that's the problem that the world has and that's why most people will never become wealthy is
(44:27) because they cannot delay their impatience they cannot delay their gratification and so for me when i'm thinking about our businesses i'm now really thinking like do i think and this is because i've been reading a lot about investor stuff and i'm like you know private equity firms will come in and their goal will be to double a company you know uh in in five years right double a company in five years and i think about that with like gym launch and there's so many times where i'm like oh we got a double this year why didn't we double but if i'd said
(44:59) like we just got a double in five and made the plan for that the plan would look so much different and also so realistically attainable that i think we'd probably over perform that but what it would do is eliminate the needless frenetic energy of of oh we gotta do this now we gotta uh you know like craziness of the shifts and the turns and and like sure there's always things that you have to adapt in the marketplace but it just gives you this steadiness as a leader and when you can look at a five-year goal but like i've never even believed in five year goals as a from a goal
(45:36) perspective but i think of it in terms of a timeline perspective of like how am i measuring myself like when i think about where i was five years ago it's it's not it's like not even comprehensible and so i mean i hope to have that kind of difference five years from now we'll see but i think that if i can take a more steady approach a more disciplined approach to growth and to value creation within the company everything that i've read about you know value-based investing um and how you know companies do turnarounds which is
(46:11) really valuable if you ever want to get into a reading topic look at you know by buying and buying and flipping businesses because you look at what they're looking at in the business is what they can do to improve and so you can basically come in with fresh eyes to your own business and think like what would i do if i were buying my business fresh from day one today which is actually a really good thought exercise and so i've kind of walked through that process and the things that i would do are different than what i'm actually doing and so by expanding it to an investor's time horizon i feel like i'm making much
(46:42) better decisions and i have much better perspective and um it's been it's just incredibly calming because i think the reason that entrepreneurs you know the double-edged sword of us is that we're emotional people we you know we ah get so excited and then we have all these ideas and we want to do all of them and the reality is that you can't you just can't you can't even do you can't even do most of them you can do a very very very small percentage of them and when a private equity buyer for example comes in to try and buy a business and improve it
(47:11) they will i'll tell you actually you know i'll tell you what this has been really enlightening for you so i'll tell you what what they do so the first thing to do is to create a hundred day plan um and the objective that hundred day plan is to align uh the economic interest of the management with the fund who and the investor who's buying it right and the way they do that is they first figure out what their uh primary two to three kpis are going to be that's it two to three and then they figure out how to accurately
(47:40) and meticulously track those things so typically you know uh investors are known for you know cutting costs and increasing profits that's like a standard thing that they'll do um but they increased the cost on it and reporting and diligence and so for me thinking about that it's like okay that just really shows how important the data and reporting is which is kind of what i was alluding to earlier and so they implement a lot of erps and crm systems that they already have you know test and whatnot to get the tracking in real time around their kpis now the number one kpi
(48:13) that they track which i found incredibly interesting which we don't track which is wild is excess cash flow and it's crazy because that's the thing i care the most about us as the owner is what am i depositing my bank out every month but uh as financials become more sophisticated you look at your profit and your ebitda and like all the you know your p l and you have to offset revenue based on contract terms blah blah blah blah right but all i care about is excess cash flow and it was ironic to me that the most sophisticated investors you know in the world some of them right uh the thing that they care about is the thing that i care about
(48:43) which is just how much cash we putting off you know and they have different reasons for that because they can serve a step better they can get better leverage which means they can get better multiples and blah blah blah and they get better returns um but for me thinking about that is something that i'm going to be reorganizing our business around which is how can we and aligning the incentive of the management team around that that kpi and so that's what they do in their first hundred days and then after that they only create two to three
(49:09) focused task forces right small teams that can be held accountable to um big domino operational objectives that will provide the most value in the the that have high probability of success they'll provide the most value to the business and so that is it and that's what they do and they just ruthless ruthlessly manage around those metrics and i think about that and what that means is they allow the management and leadership team to run the business rather than metal and i think that i definitely have a tendency to meddle
(49:39) because i like doing things my way and i want things to sound a certain way and blah blah the same things all of us do and um and it's not it's not been it actually hurts the business and so um because it removes consistency and so if we can create consistency of operations it creates it creates less waste right so you can be more efficient it creates a more consistent experience for the customers and so it allows us to make more profit from less waste it gives like i said more value and it allows us to just focus on a couple of things without feeling the constant overwhelm so i actually think that our team etc itself would be
(50:15) happier um with this type of approach and so that is how i'm kind of shifting my my perspective on our our businesses now because we have three of them um uh in doing that and so that's been really cool um i've also uh taken on um a number of small companies that i'm working with so companies that are doing one to five million dollars a year um that are uh either uh you know consulting service uh knowledge education based businesses or uh niche brick and mortar businesses um that you know have the desire to like franchise or scale uh nationally and so those are it's just because that's
(50:57) that's the businesses that i know intimately um and so i'm actually working with some companies there um and that's crazy for me because if you think about from an investor standpoint um i have a company that um i just recently um became an advisor to and uh they'd been at half a million dollars a year for two years i think um and now we're doing uh 150 000 a week uh six months later right so that's from five hundred dollar fifty thousand dollars a month to six hundred thousand dollars a month right wild uh so pretty pretty cool um very exciting um
(51:36) and uh i'm just i'm just pumped pumped about the future i think 2021's gonna be a good year um i think there's a lot of cash on the sidelines uh uh savings across the entire united states like went up a ton uh which means they're printing money and people are holding on to it which means that when people start spending that money we should see a a boom overall um i do think that you know as we have an entirely democratic uh president you know all three houses or whatever uh branches the government are all democratic i don't think they're want to not look good and so i think that
(52:06) they're going to pump the economy as much as they can which will be good in the short term and we'll see in the long term as much as everyone's really worried about the inflationary effects which is definitely a concern there's also really strong deflationary effects going on right now too uh so i also think that the people who who are running monetary policy are probably more knowledgeable than we are it's literally what they do uh for a living full-time um so just something to consider there uh but yeah that was uh 2020. i have um
(52:39) i've i've i've had a i hope you enjoyed this is different than the normal types of podcasts that i make this is kind of the the top of mind the things that have been most meaningful for me um and i'm i think i'm in the best mental place i've ever been um which is cool for me i'm not a particularly i would never have described myself as a particularly happy person um but i'm i'm i'm pretty close to happy um i don't really like the word very much um because i think it's it's really misleading but i'm i'm really i'm really i'm pretty fulfilled uh i really like
(53:17) what i do um i think i'm good at it so i find that fulfilling i find it challenging i love the game of entrepreneurship and i'm very grateful to to be able to play you know i really am and um i'm going to leave you with one thing uh that i so i talked to my 18 year old neighbor right and uh he's having a hard time uh he's got more stuff that's happened since the last time you've heard a podcast from me just personal stuff and you know he's he's having trouble with the sacrifices that are required for entrepreneurship you know he's young he
(53:49) wants to have fun and and and the thing is there's nothing wrong with that it's just the question is how bad do you want what you claim to want you know everybody wants a six-pack it's just that they want donuts more right they actually want donuts they they claim to want a six-pack but they want donuts more right and i think that that you know analogy is the same for business like he wants to be an entrepreneur but it's hard to see your friends partying and having fun and living you know their their youth youthful lives without you
(54:20) and it's easy to rationalize and say like well i should enjoy my youth and i'm not saying you shouldn't i'm really not um i just know that if you you know the sooner you start investing in skills and i'm not saying he's gonna like investing in skills is the thing right what he does to invest in the skills is irrelevant but investing in skills is how he gets there and putting a disproportionate amount of time towards developing those skills will allow him to you know outpace the competition being you know everyone else right and i said something that when i was 19 was
(54:50) a huge epiphany for me so i'm just going to share it with you um i was dating a girl for two years uh in college and she was very very obsessed with happiness it was like it was her major it was positive psychology as her major and she was really obsessed with happiness and she ended up being um an amazing person you know what i mean but i think at the base um a relatively sad person and um and i know that when we split up and during that time because you know people rub off on you i i had become really really interested in happiness how do i optimize for
(55:29) happiness every does this make me happy like all this stuff and i think happy's a horrible term i think it's a horrible term i think it poisons so many people you know um and i remember you know because you you're kind of emotional when you're younger and uh probably we're emotional or older which is better hiding it but uh when we split up uh she and i and i and i had these habits of you know reading all this positivity stuff and blah blah and and i just remember going to this place where i was just like [ __ ] happiness
(56:04) i'm just gonna win and that became my new kind of operating standard i was like [ __ ] happiness like i'm just gonna move i'm gonna take so much action that i don't have to think about it i don't have to think i have to be alone with my thoughts right i'm just going to keep moving and i'm just going to keep getting better and i'm going to keep making progress i don't care if i'm happy and a weird thing happened um once i stopped obsessing about happiness i actually think that i became more content because the thing is is i was constantly measuring myself before that to this what i would say you know what
(56:40) consider an unrealistic expectation of the human existence and uh always finding myself deficient and so the desire for happiness creates an unfulfilled expectation that makes me unhappy and disregarding happiness gives me permission to not give a [ __ ] and if i happen to be happy or enjoy a moment or or find fulfillment in my work then it becomes above my expectation and so i have a positive experience and so uh one of the biggest things that i have worked on and this is what i was talking to my 18 year old neighbor about was
(57:26) the only reason that you were upset right now is because of a fictitious expectation that you arbitrarily made up in your mind that you are not reaching that you made up it's like if i said i wanted to gain 20 pounds of muscle in seven days and then was upset that i didn't gain 20 pounds of muscle in seven days because i worked out hard it's the same thing right i was like you want to be a millionaire and you're 19.
(57:49) i was like do you feel like it's reasonable that you think that after two months of beginning your entrepreneurial journey that you don't earn above the top one percent in the united states like do you feel like it's reasonable that after eight weeks of not being in school that you are not in the top one percent it was like when you say it like that and i was like right but that's what you're thinking you're thinking like that right and so this kind of goes full circle with what i was saying earlier about having the extended time horizon
(58:23) if we can extend our horizons then we decrease our own expectations and by doing so we increase our fulfillment by default because we expect less or nothing and while we increase our fulfillment during the process we actually get better faster and that was um what i have him having him focus on is like why don't we say what's a five-year goal that we believe is reasonable and let's make it action based all right so instead of i want to make 400 000 a year in five years why don't we say what skills will i need to have that would allow me to make 400 000 a year
(59:06) and then what actions would i need to take to acquire those skills that would be reasonable even with poor talent that i would achieve that and so for example we determined that lead generation and sales if he wants to be an entrepreneur would be valuable skills and so i said okay how do you think that we can go about guaranteeing virtually that you will have those skills he's like well you know reps and i was like right so how do we get reps in and how many reps do we feel like are reasonable right i was like if you make
(59:34) 25 000 calls this year which is 100 calls a day um it's just 500 calls times 52 weeks right you think you make 25 000 calls would be you'll be able to prospect and get business he's like yeah i think after 25 000 calls that would be reasonable like cool great so that's one year next year what do we do do you think after if you took you know you know 20 20 high ticket you know calls a week over 52 weeks you know a thousand high ticket phone call closes you would be able to be at least proficient in sales he's like yeah i think i could do that like okay we still have three years left
(1:00:09) on this on this timeline but i can tell you right now if you can generate leads and you can prospect for your own thing and you can sell at high ticket amounts you can make 400 000 a year no problem but we're only two years in what else we're going to need he's like well i don't know what i'm selling i'm like that's great so then we have to develop a skill that's valuable right and so at that point i was like i'm not going to make that goal right now we're going to develop these first two and then after that we're going to go develop the other ones and so um
(1:00:33) i hope these kind of anecdotes about my my 18 year old neighbor are are useful for you um it's really it's honestly been one of the it's honestly been one of the most rewarding things for me um because i feel like i get to live i can i can help someone not you know suffer as much as i did during that process and really shortcut the the whole path to success um anyways i love you guys for listening um this is i you know i appreciate those of you who find this valuable uh this is really just my mental diary for myself so that i can look back you know and maybe
(1:01:06) maybe hopefully you know in in decades to come i'll i'll be among the billionaire bros who donates their their life life's net worth to some meaningful cause uh and they'll be like dude you gotta listen to her moses old stuff um and so hopefully that's what these are so anyways um i appreciate you all uh i'm focusing on simple i'm focusing on longer time horizons i'm focusing on finding good people i'm focusing on getting them focused on just a handful of things and just driving those and doing living a boring but steady business life
(1:01:42) and trying to come into it with no expectations and and being pleasantly surprised about anything that happens and so that is that is my outlook and i know that the world has been rough uh my recommendation is to turn off all media um it i turned off i removed all the media from my phone uh because i thought it was especially overwhelming and i realized that my life was really the same without all of the news so uh hopefully that's valuable for you and i know that the news does not make me more money and i also know that the news does
(1:02:17) not help me prepare for what is to come independently because i think to myself well what would i do differently than i'm currently doing if these things were to happen and the answer is nothing which means it's not really providing me value and if it's like well i need to stay informed if there's anything major i'll find out i don't need to go surf the news to go do that so anyways 2021 i think it's gonna be a good year for a lot of us i think a lot of people grew a lot in 2020 and so as a result their businesses will grow in 2021 like they personally
(1:02:47) grew i personally grew more in 2020 than i did in any other year um and i think that we're gonna we're gonna i think the result of that is going to show um in 2021 so uh keeping amazing and uh keeping awesome lots of love and i will catch you guys in the next vid bye [Music] [Music] [Applause] you

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on everyone uh happy sunday this is uh coming from downtown austin uh wanted to talk to you about one of the most profound belief and perspective shifts that i've had over the last few years um and i think 2020 was that year for me uh where i made one of the most profound internal shifts and the shift has yielded me unbelievable amounts of decreases in anxiety for me and honestly just increases my increase my level of certainty and i can understand why so many people fail to a much higher degree and i think one of the biggest
(00:33) curses that i had earlier on in my career is that um you know within months i went from it's just everything kind of aligned for me um mind you after five years of eating uh but nonetheless things did align for me um and very rapidly went to from making not a lot of money to millions of dollars a year in profit um to my second year uh doing almost 20 million dollars in profit uh and that that that fundamentally i think ruined me in a lot of ways earlier on because i saw that as my my benchmark you know what i mean i saw
(01:13) that as like if it's if a business is not doing this then it's failing we're doing something wrong and i think that it was a really poisonous viewpoint for me or toxic viewpoint and uh i want to share with you what what what i've shifted to and what has been such a dramatic improvement in my life and i think my business so when i look at investors and people who make a lot more money than me and people have much bigger businesses than me uh i see this common thread of looking at it from an investor's time horizon and so i feel like in
(01:42) entrepreneurship everything is about tomorrow everything's about this week everything's about this month and making payroll and all you know you have all the day-to-day things but you get so much you get so caught in the monthly goals and weekly goals that you forget to make the long-term investments that are important and not urgent and when i look at the billionaires of the world and all of them are trying to build you know escape paths to mars to me i see that i'm sure there's the cool factor but the fact that they're all
(02:09) kind of thinking about the stuff just leads me to think that they're thinking on such a larger time horizon than the rest of humanity which is probably one of the reasons that they're more successful and one of the things to think about this is kind of fast versus inevitable and i have tried to shift my perspective to wanting to do tasks and actions on a repeated basis that i know that if i repeat them over a long enough time horizon will lead me to inevitably accomplishing my goal and so what it does by shifting that way is i look at tasks
(02:42) i look at projects i look at initiatives in a very different light i also am i mean i wasn't super affected by competition in general mentally because of other things but i think this has been probably the last nail on the coffin for me in terms of like well so and so is making more or whatever right the things that we do to compare ourselves if you remove the time horizon and think of uh not next year but maybe next decade right um i've been using five years because that is a timeline that i feel like i can wrap my head around in israel
(03:13) for me um i had a mental reach out to me and he was like and you know this guy sold his thing for three 3.4 billion uh and he's like bro you need a hundred year timeline and um i i i took that in i accept that uh but i it was it's not real for me yet and so five years is something that is real for me that i can believe in and so uh what that does is if you think about time as an inevitable force that's going to move forward one way or another think about for a second how and this is for me do i see time as a threat
(03:47) do i see time as a liability something that i'm always saying is is working against me or is time and asset that is working for me and i think this has been the single greatest shift in perspective for me is now seeing if i extend my time horizon then time stops being a liability and a threat and becomes an asset and how things compound over time now works to assist me rather than hinder me and so i'll give you a simple example so uh i have never believed in seo right or really even inbound marketing and i have
(04:24) had a major shift in perspective on this uh probably in the last 12 months and the reason for that is because you know if you your first 12 months of of doing you know seo and i'm saying that as a general as a catch all time really just any inbound marketing and that is not paid advertising that results in people because that's technically kind of still outbound right you're you're putting ads out there and then getting people to respond rather than basically pool-based marketing where you're putting you're creating a water hole for people to come
(04:53) towards right and so i've i've never really invested much thought into inbound stuff at all i mean the only example of that is really this kind of vlog podcast which i never did for uh for really any business purposes it's just more for me to document my journey um but nonetheless uh thinking about this in terms of that perspective of and i've been talking to people who are like oh yeah we have this you know it's taken us five years to build this asset but now this asset creates 3000 applications a month for our for our software or for our whatever
(05:26) right and i think to myself i'm like man just building a machine that just consistently month over month creates more and more and more inbound interest is just wildly compelling to me and so i think to myself okay sure we're going to have our outbound things uh both outbound in terms of manual outbound with people cold call call email etc you know cooldm but also we have our outbound with paid advertising across platforms but the kind of the third piece of this is what can we quote invest in that if i did it over five years i believe it
(06:02) would be unreasonable for me to not have built another channel that is reliable and sustainable and enduring and so you'll probably see some more things for me in the next 12 months along that line because i think it's really awesome and i want to use compound growth to my advantage rather than as a hindrance rather than it's something that i compare myself to and feel always inadequate and so what i think that the shift from the ceo to investor mindset has helped me with is the stress that i put on myself uh for
(06:37) like quarterly goals and looking at someone else who might have started at the same time as me and is doing better than me because then i get to think to myself okay but we're not comparing ourselves now we're comparing ourselves to what's going to happen in 20 years right will their company still be here and i'm trying to build something that endures that lasts that maybe even can be passed on to a future generation and i don't think those were ever thoughts of mine when i was starting my entrepreneurial career and i wish they had been and so i
(07:06) don't know where you're at right now but maybe if you can if you can take that perspective and think to yourself what could i create that and what tasks did i do what projects could i invest in that even if they don't pay off this quarter or next quarter even the next 12 months i think that it would be inevitable that i would have a disproportionate payoff five years from now and obviously that begets the obvious you know the the single greatest constraint that most people have which is they can't do anything consistently but
(07:33) i believe i can do things consistently and i think that many of the people listening to this can do things consistently and so if you have that character trailer already you've developed that discipline i feel like using that discipline to invest in things that are going to create disproportionate returns is a good use of uh time right for us and so i'll give you a real example around this uh we're looking at doing an initiative uh on the gym launch in our dremels company uh related to just generating more you
(08:00) know inbound applications and whatnot and i was talking to our gm about it and i was saying listen let's let's not think about that for like this quarter uh i mean we can start now but let's not measure the roi until you know next year and i don't think i would ever have said something like that a year or two ago i don't even think it would even be a thought um but it's it's been wildly freeing because there's so much less pressure around initiatives and i think it actually improves the quality of the initiative and the execution of the team
(08:33) because they're not immediately being like oh it's been a week and it's not working so we're failing right and so um let me give you another really good nugget that i've had recently around this which is um rather than looking at week over week month-over-month sales growth instead i asked myself the question what one thing if i tripled it in our company what non-sales related you know what not in revenue related thing that if i were to triple it it would be unreasonable to believe that my company would not triple
(09:08) as well and for me that was inbound qualified or i'm saying about but just number of qualified applications generated that was a metric that i was like okay sometimes when you're increasing the number of applications that are coming in uh you have a new sales person a new sales team and their their close rate is low it happens right it's part of scaling a business but over a long enough time horizon it would be unreasonable for me to believe that if i were to triple my number of applications uh i would not see a you
(09:40) know a proportional increase in sales and so what's interesting to me is that if i can i've never actually thought about a leading indicator because i have leading indicators on churn which is like customer activation and i talk about that in other stuff but i've never actually had a leading indicator on growth which is fascinating to me that i've never had this which is like hilarious but actually measuring the number of sales accepted leads and that is that's defined as a lead that the sales team accepts because they showed and are
(10:09) qualified right they are the type of person uh who who we can serve uh you know they have the size business that we work with you know and they showed up and they have interest right so that would be a sales qualified lead and so trying to say i want to increase sales by five percent a month is a fine goal the thing is is that there are so many other variables that can affect it in a short time horizon like that whereas saying i want to increase our number of inbound applications by five percent per month is far more
(10:40) consistent and reasonable to do and so if you thought about like a line right if i increa i know that i can increase through consistent activity the number of inbound uh applications either through adding more people to outreach uh creating more channels for content um and then you know obviously there's the paid side which is you can add another platform etc right and so if i if i draw that line that is something i can consistently do and so when i'm thinking about growing my business and hitting a goal like tripling it
(11:09) right in the next five years and i think okay well then let's take let's take our sales qual sales qualified leads right and let's draw that as our line and that's going to be our baseline right that's what we're going to focus all our attention on the day-to-day activities around that those are going to be like the stock market right they're going to be up and down up and down up and down and i think most of us are looking at such small time horizons it looks crazy but if you look at it from an investor's perspective in terms of years or decades
(11:38) then you can really see the truth and the reason that a stock will go up over a decade is simply because of the true economic value that a company is providing right and so for me a leading indicator of growth would be the number of interested inquiries that we get and so that is actually going to be my primary predictive metric that i will be driving because i know that of course we're going to change processes sure we might change crms you know we might change our funnel or our sales like all these things are small things but
(12:08) if i can simply increase the number of qualified applications of people who want to for example grow their gym uh by 3x in the next five years then i can reasonably believe that i would be able to achieve it and thinking that way it's just been amazing and so uh that is what i'm dedicated to doing and some of these smaller projects which for me were like well this thing isn't going to double our lead gen so i don't want to do it i've really shifted my perspective on that and so i'm now looking at uh reliable inflows it's like okay well
(12:40) i think this one thing can generate us 20 new clients a month that's not huge for us but it's it's it's noticeable and so okay well then how you know how much does it take to to invest in that how long do it you know and and and let's start it let's start the let's start the snowball right and so that's one of the that's what i was talking my gm about and so we're actually going to do this initiative that i think will results in about 20 new clients a month and it's going to take us time to get there but i but i
(13:06) think it's it's going to be really really uh valuable for us right over the long haul especially and so let me just take a quick look at my notes real quick because i wanted to make sure i'm not missing anything for you um do to do [Music] yeah i think that's i think that's um that's my biggest thing right that's that's pretty much my message for for what my biggest perspective shift has been is thinking about a five-year time horizon shifting from ceo to shareholder uh shifting from ceo to to board member or advisor
(13:43) and thinking about it over those time horizons and i feel like if you can just make that change i wish i could explain to you how much less stress i have because if you know the company goes up by a little bit or down by a little bit one month over another month it just it just doesn't affect me like it doesn't affect my life in any way and i feel like i had my ego so and this is actually the last point that i had in my notes which is my ego is just so much less impacted by the fluctuations of the business that it's just it's just phenomenally
(14:14) increased my standard of living like i'm just i'm just really not that stressed about things you know it i just can't even express it to you and so anyways this has been probably the biggest lesson of 2020 for me um and obviously 2020 for us was uh um we our profit was cut in half we did i think 13.4 in profit last year and we did i think six six this year we're getting our final books but around that this year in profit which was technically my lowest year of profit in a while and um but i can truthfully tell you it just
(14:43) really doesn't affect me because i know it's a momentary business disruption because of a pandemic that disproportionately affected my clients than many you know than many other industries um and i don't think it would be unreasonable for me to believe that over the next three years right that we would we would not only recover but grow past where we were before and so in thinking about that um anyways i just it's been it's just viewing time as an ally and not an ally or an asset not a threat or a liability and
(15:13) once you can when i can hitch my cart to something that is inevitable like the past and the passing of time um then i feel like you're aligned with forces that will grow you without your permission and so anyways i'll leave you with that i hope you have an amazing day and keep being awesome catch you on the flip side [Music] [Music] [Applause] you

Transcript:
(00:00) what are you afraid of I'm scared that I'll fail at the goal then you can judge how successful you were by how much you adhered to the actions that you committed to so I run a writing company I write for celebrities and CEOs because I took your advice and I started writing for people that have more money and it's oh gosh solve rich people problems they pay better yes um but I also publish my own books and I traditionally published with Publishers and I've done well but in the future going forward I want to publish my own book self-publish my own books
(00:37) but I have analysis paralysis because there's so many options to execute a strategy sometimes I don't know which option to pick to just execute the strategy for my next book and my first goal is just to sell a thousand ebook copies not nothing even Grand yeah okay then when I settle on a strategy I get scared because I don't know if it's going to work so two questions real quick so when you say you have so many different strategies you can pick from you're talking about different topics for the book is that what you're saying I know the book topic but different options to execute a plan so I could use
(01:09) Quick clickfunnels to execute a plan to sell a thousand cop yeah just selling it yeah just selling a thousand copies that's that that's my goal I want to be able to sell a thousand copies for my next self-published book have you read the book yet have you written the book yet no but the book will be that's the easy part okay I'm a writer so that's the easy part okay okay okay yeah you're asking the universe for a guarantee that it will never give you and you're waiting for a response in order to move
(01:35) forward from a universe that stays silent and so you're just talking to dead people um and waiting for a response so like um the thing is is the person you should be talking to is the marketplace because they will always respond like when you knock they will open the door and they will tell you to [ __ ] off or they you open the door and they'll tell you they'll let you in but either way they'll open the door right let's play this out the other way what are you afraid of cuz like you seem very upbeat and you see like obviously WR this you've written stuff before and so like I'm not worried about your writing skill given what you've said so far so
(02:05) like what are you afraid of okay so let's let's play it out so let's say you you have your book and you pick path one it doesn't even matter what it is pick path one okay so what so what happens so you put it on Amazon you're like I'm just going to put it on Amazon and see what happens all right that's the easy path okay then what yeah I'm I'm scared that I won't reach my number I'm scared that I'll fail at the goal and then then what happens but then I still won't know how to do it like and and I'm also
(02:30) scared because I have self-published a couple books in the past that didn't reach my goal and I know that feels like I don't want to feel like that again yeah so let me so let me do this then let's reframe this because I have a lot of experience with setting goals all right so I feel pretty confident talk about the topic make the big goals that you set things that you could absolutely control like you cannot control how many people buy your book but you can control the amount of actions that you're
(02:54) willing to take that make it unreasonable that you don't sell a th000 copies and so then you can judge how successful you were by how much you adhered to the actions that you committed to and so if I were to say you have to sell 10,000 books not a thousand books 10,000 books you have to or you lose your life in 12 months you just die that's it you die what would you do knock on every door okay you have the leads book right you there all there's eight different ways to advertise right and so you know that the more people find out about your stuff the more
(03:26) people buy it and you know there's only four things you can do right you can talk to people oneone you can make content you can run ads right or you can get other Affiliates you can get referrals once they read your book or you can get agencies or you can get employees to help you out that's what you got yeah okay and so if you know that you have to take those actions then wouldn't success be so let's play this out a year let's say that you did absolutely everything on the plan like your plan of advertising
(03:52) of letting people know about it for a year and you did everything and you sold 999 bucks would you consider it a failure no that would be a win okay now if you sold 90 books I just want to reframe this because the honestly the thing that you're talking about is something that so many people deal with and it's because you want to control things you want to control the outcome and you're saying I'm only willing to pay this price if there's this outcome but you're seeing the outcome as the outcome rather than the skills that you develop along the way as the outcome because I can promise you this this will not be the the last book you write right
(04:25) and so if you get to a hundred sales instead of a thousand mhm then what's going to happen realistically is that you will figure out the one thing or two things that actually work to sell books and then I'll say do a hundred times more of that and you can either choose to do that on this book or you can choose to do it on the next book but the idea of like I have I'm setting this thousand because you could have said a million books it doesn't really matter you're just setting it you're making up a number and saying this I feel is reasonable for me but instead of making the number reasonable make the actions that would
(04:54) lead to that the reasonable like what can you commit to four hours a day of promotion yeah okay then make that the commitment and I will I'll promise you that if you do that every day one at the end of the year you will feel accomplished because you actually did what you said you were going to do and I will tell you that the marketplace will also always recognize someone who puts four hours of work every single day into one thing just what I needed thank you just promise me that you'll actually just commit to doing the work if you do that you do
(05:24) like I have to get sell 10,000 books what would I actually do to do that yeah yeah find somebody who has an audience that is relative to the the topics that you're talking about and reach out to that now it's okay if I got one person they sold 20 books okay how do I reach out to a thousand people who all have my audience if you do that you'll probably sell more than a thousand books but you just got to do it four hours every day thank you thank you good luck with the book I know how much work goes into that so I have two topics that uh I kind of want to you know trade with
(05:54) you and you know you titled this advice for hard days and it's been it's been tough lately about three months ago uh my grandmother was diagnosed with cancer two months ago uh my girlfriend the the girl that I thought with I was going to marry kind of left and then two weeks ago uh I traveled to London to speak at Europe's biggest business event and on the first day of my arrival my granddad passed away and so uh I had to basically uh speak in front of thousands of people and keep my smile and then travel back and bury him so yesterday I I did I did
(06:35) I did all of it and so the question is well you know yesterday everything just kind of hit me because now I'm back in the office and I'm taking the calls and I'm trying to deal with everything but the question is how do I maintain my composure and kind of stay strong right because it's it's a tough period well first off I'm sorry that you're going through that um that being said honestly you've got a lot of good stuff going for you so this is a I feel like almost a relatively easier one for me to take given what you just said like you just asked a question how do I do something I've already done before which is you
(07:05) got in front of thousands of people and gave a presentation and had a smile and you crushed it despite the fact that you had other circumstances right yeah and so you ask the question how do I do something that I already done you've already done it like what you're saying is how do I how do I keep living and you keep living by keeping living it's the same thing with breakups right it's like I I've heard this quote I I heard it from Lea I think the first time like the amount of time it takes you to get over someone do you know how long it is there's a math equation for
(07:37) it there's a great math equation for it you'll love it it's exactly as long as you decide it takes and what I'm going to say is going to sound really dark right now so I want you to take this the right way take it the way I mean it all right which is that you just had you had three deaths right you had death of a life that you thought you were going to have with a girlfriend and then you had the death of uh two different grandparents right you had three deaths but well um on the positive sides my my
(08:01) grandmother is still battling with it oh okay she's still B wait we're plus one all right so only two deaths now but sure we can even play it out all right on a long enough time rizon she will eventually pass away right it's going to happen yeah and the thing is is that you are already standing it like you're asking how do I stand it but you are standing here already like you are evidence to the F you are you you talking to me today is evidence of the success that you're asking asking for you're already one dude you're showing up and you're working every day you're coming here to ask questions to actually
(08:34) still trying and grow yourself like the the stuff that you go through become the stories that you will someday tell and no one likes epic Heroes without Epic monsters and so you have to go through the rocky cut scene you have to have those periods of time where you doubt yourself well everyone else doubts yourself where the walls are crumbling around you because have you ever read shoe dog fil knight story about Nike even if you haven't the entire story is just him getting kicked in the nuts for 30 years that's the whole story and then
(09:00) he's like oh yeah and then I built Nike right and now if he had just said yeah um I started this company and everyone loved it and all my suppliers were on time and I just scaled straight and as the money came in I just bought more inventory and then we just went public no one would care because it's not relatable and the thing is is that when you die the only thing that will remain is the story that people will tell of you and so wouldn't you want that to be an epic story yeah and so the things that you're going through are required for the person you want to be and for
(09:30) the goals that you have and how you are acting in the present already proves the thing that you're claiming that you want tomorrow you're going to wake up and you go to work and the next day you're going to wake up and you're go to work and then you're going to text and it's going to say that your grandmother's cancer is getting worse and what are you going to do you're going to get back to work you're just going to keep doing the stuff like there's no there's no magic bullet you just keep going because
(09:54) either you keep going or you die yeah and if you don't die you succeeded I would just say stop just don't judge yourself on how you feel judge yourself by what you do despite how you feel so you can feel shitty you can wake up and have a terrible day and still show up with a smile in front of a thousand people and so if you can do with a thousand people you can do it with one and that first one is the person that looks at you in the mirror in the morning and and now when it comes to business I just have a real quick
(10:24) question okay uh so I've built an Instagram audience to over a 100,000 I speak about sales and marketing uh I've been doing it for the past two years I've been posting kind of like every day uh I know the content game but the one thing that I'm struggling to balance is you know how you say give give give until they ask and you know I love it but sometimes it takes a while until they ask right and cash flow still needs to come in and I run uh a service based uh business and so how do I balance it out without tiring my audience because I also my community is known for you know
(11:00) really being in the comments chatting with me and being there for me so how do I do it so if you want to have a one step away from like just giving forever right is that you you give in public sell in private which is when people respond to your stories right when people DM you like those are conversations that they're usually asking or they're like they're basically ask when people ask questions there you can still Define a scope and say hey like at at a certain point I have like I've given you all this value use all the free stuff if you want more than that I'd be happy to hop on a call and see if I can help you more right so it's
(11:34) not it's not like everyone buy this thing right now right you're not you're not like getting super aggressive about you still publicly just keep pumping all the Goodwill and the value that you are and that'll grow your audience and it'll increase goodwi and all of those things that's what you want you're going to keep doing that it's just that you could still have a call to action that's just in the in the in the comment section or put a story up that says hey by the way if you need help with that thing I'm I'm happy to help like those are those are
(11:59) very light touch things cuz I understand you got to pay bills I understand that and so you can put those things out without necessarily damaging the Goodwill that I think you're that you're that you're obviously building to hang in there you'll be fine you'll get through it and then it'll be a story that you'll someday tell yeah and thank you for everything that you do not just for me but for everyone else because I think you're marking A New Path uh and that's that's kind of cool I appreciate you br thank you what's the one question
(12:23) that you wish you would have asked yourself earlier in your entrepreneurial career when faced with a little bit of uncertainty and Direction 90% of my business is in person online that's the kind of the the direction of whether or not I really want to go towards um more specifically you know creating almost like a watify version of kettle bells just trying to figure out what the next step is going to be so me asking myself a question is always going to be different than you asking something for you because we're different people right and we have different goals and so everything usually Lads up to like what's the goal what's the why and so
(12:59) like right now do you have like a monetary goal do you have an impact goal and believe me I have no issues if you're like I just want to make a certain amount of money like I get that because any of the businesses that you just mentioned so whether it's the brick and mortar uh business or you want to start doing training for those people online or it's doing the watify version which is basically no service and just providing workouts and whatnot all of those are are potential businesses but pursuing all of them at the same time
(13:23) will virtually guarantee that you don't succeed at any of them and so the biggest issue when you're starting out is just pick the path and being willing to commit to it with the uncertainty that comes with it because like every entrepreneurial path has uncertainty like and that's what makes entrepreneurship hard it's literally the not knowing and the pain of suffering consequences for ignorance for things that you've learned now that you're like if I had only known then what I know now and that's every entrepreneur until the day they die and it's just wishing that
(13:49) it were different that causes a lot of the struggle so which of these things of the three that I just mentioned like which of those is the one that like lights you up the most I mean iners training obviously like we live in a small Beach toown Community where everybody knows everybody and it's fun it's family it's convenient I will say there's that comfort factor that it almost in one scope is very beneficial because it is so comfortable but in reality too like Comfort is the enemy of achievement and growth so it's like I know like the comfortable side is the inperson and it's the community and it's
(14:20) fun it's family friends whereas the uncomfortable more challenging but also very big picture-wise would be the online going Full Tilt that side now i' I've breached into the gap of like three-day launches four day launches of you know small ticket low ticket offers but in terms of you know trying to scale and make an impact on the world the world's really big that so that's always really hard because I remember I had a we had an event with Jim owners and somebody stood up I said what's your mission they're like I want to impact 1 Million Lives I was like dude you have a brck and morar location that has like 200 members like let's like if you
(14:53) really want to do that then you would actually just you would you you would you would approach it very differently or you'd have a Time rise and that's the rest of your life right it's like one or the other if you're like I want to do that in 3 years you wouldn't start with a brick and mor location and so the thing is is that what you said earlier is like you you feel comfortable and it sounds like you want to grow I just want to make sure that's correct before I like keep going okay so there there was
(15:13) like an underlying assumption at least that was unspoken and I just want to draw attention to it which was you're like the brick and mortar thing is comfortable it's family it's friendly it's fun I'm assuming it's profitable I'm assuming you're making some money doing that the thing is is like you could like just doing more of what you're currently doing and saying like how do I open a second location or how do I you know like how do I open like locations over the next 5 years or whatever it is that would produce probably just as much of a challenge as
(15:37) going online would except you already have two years of learnings on how to run that business where you have none in the online space you always just want to Stack knowledge within a specific vertical so that you just go deeper and deeper on it because that's where the compounding returns happen like the richest people that I know have been in the same space for 40 years they just know everything there is to know about the space and like that's how they've made their money you can either open a location that's not necessarily in a
(16:01) beach down and test your metal and see how good you are at actually scaling a team you know hiring somebody else seeing if somebody else if you can actually incentivize people build a culture so that people want to work for you that you can recreate the success and that'll show you whether the success that you had was because of you or because of your ability as a as a businessman right because like you can be a charismatic razzled Dazzle dancing bear in any brick-and mortar business and it will work it'll work surface with a smile always works right and it's just hard to
(16:29) scale because most people don't care as much as owners do but if you can create the model that has the incentives and the training in place and the and the procedures that can consistently create that five out of five experience that allow a second location to have the same amount of success as your first location then you have something that absolutely can scale and create lots of Enterprise Value over time so I would say either scale that or basically dial down your iners to as little ass humanely possible of your time and then go all in on the online thing but uh trying to do both
(17:02) will be very hard because what'll happen is you'll start to do some online stuff you'll start to see some traction your gym will start going down but that's your main source of income then you'll hop back to the gym the online will dip and you'll go back and forth and so that's why I'm so big on just committing to whatever thing is because any of them would work but you just have to be all in on it the one pillar that I guess I failed to mention was the freedom and flexibility this being a seasonal town where I'm at it's like being able to
(17:26) essentially create a life where it allows me to own and be at the brick and mortar for say four months out of a year and then from there being able to live elsewhere and then from there because at the end of the day I don't have much responsibility here aside from the just just the gym I don't have anything else really that's Tim me to home but that's where I guess my my North Star has been for a long period of time let me just give you step one here I own a ton of brick and mortar locations as is like
(17:50) right now I've got 70 stores that I own between different companies that are brick and mortar locations I'm not in any of them and so like the idea that you need to go online in order to not be in person is a fallacy that's not true like you can own your gym because like if you were to open a second location you wouldn't be there either right and so the easiest way to test this 1.
(18:12) 0 test is like if you can step out and just not go to the gym for a year then maybe you can do the other thing and if you haven't gone to the gym for a year then maybe you'll do the you'll do a second gym and so I think no matter what path you do this is probably a perfect end for this which is you either are going to do the online thing after you figure out how to Outsource gym or delegate it and hire people who are awesome or you decide you're going to do a second location either way you're going to have to start with Outsourcing the first gym
(18:37) let's say I um I want to start a business I can have a very Grand Vision of the business so like apple or Microsoft they they had this vision of like changing the whole world how do we keep working on this business for years when we're worried that it might get outdated because of a new AI or a technology or in other words what do we do when we think our project might not be useful in the long run I mean what you're talking about is strategy like these are strategic decisions that we have to make like you make a big bet on where you think the market is going to be not where it is today if you're going to go after something that's that big
(19:16) but do do you have investors right now I'm I'm a entrepreneur if you you say that if you look at the companies that you just referenced right like you look at basos with Amazon you look at you know Zuckerberg you look at Microsoft every one of those guys started well off and well capitalized okay so basos was a investment banker from Wall Street Bill Gates parents were really well off and he was well off and whatnot Zuckerberg went to Harvard same deal you if you want to really go after that you would have to try and recreate the conditions
(19:47) and I think that right now the likelihood that that happens given your current situation is low and I'm not saying that to disuade you I'm saying because I want to be realistic with you which is that you need to get your own head above water cuz like right now if you're if you don't have the ability to make money on your own right from a entrepreneurial perspective like you need to get your head above water because the only way that you can stick with something for the required amount of time in order for it to become world
(20:11) changing like we're not talking even a decade I mean those companies they're you know 20 Facebook's 20-some years old right just like context and so the only way to get there uh is be able to breathe while you're going and so I think that from a a one-on-one perspective starting starting a simple business that you can generate income on that you know you can you can learn the basics of business before trying to take on the biggest competitors in the most well capitalized Arena absolutely on your own I see not to say that that's impossible it's just incredibly
(20:41) improbable given the the circumstances that you just laid out it would be really romantic for me to be like dude go chase your dreams go do that but like I also would rather have you in a year making money on your own so that you can breathe because you might find out that if you actually start making on money on your own you might just like that because right now it's just the idea of the status of the dream of that like it's an amorphous idea but the amount of pain and suffering that you have to be able to put up with and not make money
(21:05) through that whole period of time really tough wouldn't that cause another issue where because you you decide to choose a pro choose to solve a problem that is small like smaller than the Grand Vision uh then you won't be able to scale much that's not necessarily true and also every one of those company start small like Facebook wasn't like we want to be the social media platform for the whole world he wanted to map colleges s they start with a niche and then they expand outwards and so you would want to much more narrowly Define your problem before you go attack it because what you're
(21:34) going to try and do is build something that's going to be everything for everyone and it's going to be nothing for nobody strategy is prioritization it's allocating limited resources against unlimited options and so you have unlimited options but you have very limited resources and so in order to be successful you have to narrow the problem that you're trying to solve so you can allocate the small amount of resources you have to adequately solve that problem completely and then from adequately solving that problem completely like Amazon started with books and Facebook started with colleges
(22:02) right you solve and then you can go adjacent right so right now it just sounds exciting to say this but like it's not reality you have to pick one problem that you're going to get really good at solving and that's it and then you can have an idea that in the future but real real so many things are going to change between now and then and there's so much luck that that that has to concur because if you think about this zooming all the way out the biggest companies the world have super well capitalized people who are the best in the world made a good call and had luck
(22:29) because if you're number one you have all the things plus luck like if you're number one at like in the whole world it's all of it plus luck the market moves in a direction that that you never know right and so I would rather you just stick to a problem that you know you can absolutely solve given the resources you have learn the skills make income and then from there you can go solve an adjacent problem or you might decide you know what I like this and I'm going to keep going with it thank you very much that's that was really awesome
(22:54) you're on good luck man all right so my question is basically I've been an online fitness coach for the last like three years now and like even progressing from like the first 10K a month like three years ago and like 25k a month a couple months ago I kind of felt like I got loner the more successful I got even though I do have a pretty big audience now like maybe you went through something that something like that or maybe you haven't in that sense I was just wondering like maybe how you got over that self liim belief
(23:20) because I feel like that's kind of holding me back I want to make sure that I'm I want to clearly understand your question so you're saying that being lonely is the thing that is holding back I know my lifestyle changes oh obviously you're going to lose friends along the way the conversation is a lot different in that sense but just like especially from going in person and being a full-time in person training and going line top of that just like a lot more lonely can in a lot of different aspects of losing that kind of touch you just need you just have to join a community man like just straight up like you just
(23:51) need you just need to get around people who are doing the same thing as you and so that might mean physically moving to a different area cuz right now I'm assuming online pay like pays your bills correct yeah right so if online pays your bills then you can literally be anywhere in the world and so if you where do you live right now I'm Emon Alberta I'm planning to move to Colona it's more of like a fitness town in Canada like two months time I would do that and I would also join a bunch of online communities of people who are like trying to make money in the fitness space because you'll find a ton of other people who are doing the same thing as
(24:21) you that are on the path that are ahead of you they're the same as you that are behind you and you you can get a little bit of some some fulfillment from helping out some of the people behind you but you can also get help from the people ahead of you um who are you know because you show that you'll you'll execute and you'll do what they say um and you'll and you'll grow but this is the nice news is that this problem is super solvable like you just got to get around people and you got to be willing to be rejected I mean it's just like Fitness sales it's just like friend
(24:44) sales it's the same thing you just go you go you go on a bunch of dates they're just friend dates you know go hang out go get a lift in I mean it's Fitness so like just go ask a bunch of people to get a lift in and you'll see who's cool and you'll see who isn't worst case scenar you get a workout yeah have you ever kind of experienced that as a kind of leveled up and leveled up I know you as long as you keep growing this is not going to stop you're going to find new friends and if you keep growing you'll pass them and then you'll
(25:07) find new friends that are above them and you'll pass them and you'll just keep going um and so it just depends on how like what you see the role of friends as in your life and so you know for me I just want my requirement for friend isn't necessarily that they make the same or more money than me at all is do they make me better do they make me better do they have my best intentions in heart which is already two incredibly difficult things to pass but if someone passes both those things then they are a friend and so I would just use that as a limit test like is this person making me
(25:39) better and do they have my best you know incentive at heart yeah and how is making friends I guess now because obviously you're a higher level and things are different with social status and all that I mean vers four it's probably different so do kind of have the same standards now are kind of like what is what is it kind of like dude it's harder for me than it is for you yeah right um no for real it is but the thing is is that uh most of the my closest friends don't live here like don't live in the same physical area
(26:09) that I do most of the closest friends that I have live all over and so I see most of my friends once or twice a year and that's it and I work in the meantime the thing is is that like the higher up you go here like and I'll just tell you something like from My Level whatever you want to call that um all the friends I have everyone completely like there are zero social obligations for anything like none and if I don't respond to a text for 3 days there is zero drama it's not even acknowledged it's just we know that busy people understand that busy people are doing [ __ ] and so if everyone you have
(26:41) everyone who's who's in your world understands that you're trying to take this hill then if they're truly your friend then they want you to take the hill more than they want you to respond to their text or come out with them for the weekend like I just got invited to a 7-Day thing that um with a with a couple friend that Lea and I both really really adore um but we'll probably not be able to do it because we have so much stuff that we were that we doing at that same time and I really want to go but I also
(27:07) really want to do this other stuff and I know that I will feel worse about myself if I don't have this other stuff done and so we're going to say that I can't go and that's going to be it and they're not going to hold it against me and so until you find friends who are 100% aligned with you achieving your goals who are making you better and want you to hit your goals then you just keep looking but the thing is like everybody goes through the period that you're at like I think I I think I made I wrote a tweet about this but like there is this lonely period that always happens when you
(27:37) start growing because it happens is that you're too big for the old friend group but you're not quite big enough for the group that you want to get into right so you kind of have this path in the Middle where you just kind of like keep trudging along but like every single person who's accomplished anything material has been in your exact same shoes and you just keep going and you keep going you keep networking you enter you go into the communities you see the people who are adding value to those communities and you message them you
(28:02) find the givers cuz givers recognize givers almost immediately you can see the people who are always giving more above and beyond and you can understand they get the game and so like in that first meeting if they're like like let me see if I can do this for you let me like take care of this for you let me help you in this way rather than like hey could you help me with this like wrong person but if you just start by giving to a whole bunch of people who are where you want to be you'll get more back even if nine out of 10 don't give you anything back provide shitloads of value people will message you and they
(28:31) be like hey let's hop on a zoom let's grab a zoom lunch whatever and so like you can have a ton of friend dates or whatever that you meet people and see if they have game and if they have game then you keep in touch because you're making them better too I appreciate everything you bet brother kill the content game [ __ ] after doing full-time entrepreneurship for three years right um and you know raising a family I got four four small children all under the age of five I found myself in a very hard position where I had to go back to a 9 to-5 I would say entrepreneurship is like like you said it's hard and and I
(29:04) know what hard feels like but after discussing it with my wife like I felt like this was like the right decision after getting myself into business dead and other things like that and I didn't never have a paycheck to live on you know so how do I know when it's like like how do I get back into entrepreneurship like now I'm just running my stuff on the Sid so for example right when I was laid off uh three years ago I was doing taxes and I just doing like um bookkeeping and then I worked my way up starting to offer
(29:37) accounting services and then I leveled up and I started look going after higher levers like now I started doing CFO services and um I went through that Valley of Despair thing and that's probably why I'm at where I'm at right now you know okay um just being completely honest and I I appreciate you being hand in upfront about it cuz otherwise this wouldn't be very valuable cuz you'd tell me a bunch of fake information and I'll give you a response to fake information it wouldn't matter for either of us so thank you for being
(30:05) honest um that being said you're not honestly you're in a pretty good spot and I'll tell you why so you have a valuable skill set that will always be in demand because a lot of people don't want to do money stuff so people don't do budgets people don't do bookkeeping people don't do CFO work people want to do financials projections forecasts no one wants to do any of that stuff and you do and you're good at it so presumably you're good at it because you keep doing it right I'll just I'll I'll leave it at that I'm going to assume
(30:29) that for for the sake of our call right so um one I think it was wise that you got a job because you have a wife you have four kids I think that was a smart Noggin move okay now that being said there's going to be a conversation that you probably have to have with your wife about what because your nights and weekends either are going to have to go to family or they're going to have to go to the new thing and so I think that you need to have a candy conversation with her and say listen my Prim and I'm I'm put I'm putting words in your mouth here so this is if I were in your shoes I
(31:00) would say as a man my primary drive is to provide and right now I feel like I'm failing you and I want to lead our children by example so that when they are 20 or 30 and they're thinking about making that jump I can speak to it because I wasn't afraid to take the risk again because in gymnastics as soon as you fall off the pommel horse even if you twist or break your ankle you what they do they try and get you right back on the horse again and they do that because if you don't and you take enough time off you start developing these fears around getting back on you never get on again and so they want you to get
(31:36) back on the horse and right now I think you got bucked by the entrepreneurial horse and that's okay it happens it's part of the game right like it's the it's the the scene in Rocky 17 or whatever [ __ ] Rocky it is where he's like it's not about how hard you can hit about but it's about hard you can get hit and keep going forward right and so you got hit big you know big whoop everybody gets hit everyone [ __ ] loses all the time I lost everything twice before this time right and so like you've lost everything once you still you still owe me one you can tell your wife I said that
(32:07) and so let's get into tactics all right so right now the in my opinion the issue that you miss is you didn't know how to advertise you didn't know how to promote and so you have the service you just got to let people know about it and so you were full-time as an entrepreneur but you probably weren't spending four hours a day promoting and so when you are you're 100% correct right and so that's that's what need to do so nights and weekends for you is you log out of work go home kiss the dog high five the kids and then you spend four hours promoting and promoting is you make content you
(32:38) reach out to people or you run ads and given your financial situation it's going to be making content and reaching out to people that's it literally if that's what you're you start your timer four hours you make content you reach out to people and you do that for four straight hours every day you do that you're going to have more business in the next six months than you even know know what to do with that's it that's all you have to do like you the thing is you're in a good spot cuz you have the skill that there's already demand like I
(33:01) don't have to test your idea you're trying to provide bookkeeping services it's a commoditized service like if you do a good job you're on time like you are responsive you deliver things on the first of the month people will want to do business with you and they'll stay with you and so you just got to let people know about it faster because I'm guessing that your rate was based on referrals you had one or two customers maybe three and by the time you get one new referral every two or three months one would drop and you stayed there until eventually you couldn't right I'm guessing that was the story right so you
(33:26) just need to increase your sales velocity which means you got to let more people know about it and you got to learn how to sell because it was just you right did you have any employees no I had a virtual assistant during tax season but yeah it was mainly just me yeah then you have the easiest business in the world because 100% of the revenue is profit right it's just you for now and so you can absolutely get yourself to 10 20 accounting clients and you're going to be working like a dog at this point but you'll be making way more than you are now and then you'll have new problems cuz then your wife's like I don't see you anymore you're like yeah
(33:56) but now we're making three times money and I will find a way to use the money to buy back some time and you can do that but idea like you're you're like you already have the hard [ __ ] done you're like 6 months away seriously like I don't normally say that like you're 6 months away you got to you got to reach out to let's call it let's call it 10,000 people you reach out to 10,000 people you'll have you'll have the business you want because I'm telling you right now as a business owner dude the amount of crappy accountants and bookkeepers that out there outnumber the good ones 100 to one like no one's
(34:26) stoked about their book keeper so like like it's not hard and like think about it those guys don't like those guys suffer the same issue that you have is they don't know how to promote themselves they're not business people they're Bean counters and so like you you've been you've been in bean counter mode and you got to get in you got to get in promoter mode especially as a as a solo entrepreneur it's all promotion in the beginning so would you suggest just mainly cold Outreach or should I try to do content or just go straight
(34:50) cold Outreach you can do both I mean dude one post a day one post a day see who interacts with it so who likes it who comments on it you can message all those people and then you can reach out as well but the thing is is with your profession finding someone who has an adjacent audience so uh you know if someone who's an HR company or a recruiting company right like if you can figure out a way to just work with them they already have a whole engine of people coming in and just see if you can just get off the backside and give them
(35:15) a kickback just for intros like that's a super productive way of uh of leveraging the amount of reach outs like you can just reach out to 10,000 business owners and you'll you'll get your nut but you could probably reach out to a th000 B2B businesses and see if you can structure a partnership with them that they can refer you business and you refer it back to them but yes content and Outreach you and real talk the content is probably not in the beginning where you're going to get the majority of your business I just want to just prepare you for that
(35:40) but the reason that you're going to be making the content in the beginning is that so when you do Reach Out people will go to your page and they will consume your content and then they will decide to respond based on the quality so think about that stuff as lead nurture more than lead genen in the beginning over time you'll get better at it it'll start generating business but it might take you a year or two like it takes time to get good at that you've inspired me and that's the reason why I took the jump in the beginning so I appreciate you well I appreciate you for
(36:04) taking the jump and um I will ask you to trust me one more time which is that four hours a day have the conversation with your wife 10,000 reach outs and let me know in six months she's watching so she knows all right let celese take his 10,000 reach outs that's it like on the other side of 10,000 reach outs is you making the money that you want to make and having the skill of promotion and sales that's it I just want you to know and I and I hope that mation exists here for this one reason which is that like you are not alone there are other people going through it and so despite that it
(36:33) may feel lonely you are not alone keep being one of zero

Transcript:
(00:00) a number of businesses just lined up over 2 days to ask me questions they range from $200,000 a year to $140 million a year and the crazy thing is is the questions between businesses are so similar that they apply to all of them and we pulled out the best moments that we think will give you the highest Roi enjoy hey Alex thanks yeah you bet so my name is Zach LaVine we sell Pain Management Services to New Yorkers okay um Integrated Pain so kpt um but like old people young people women men it we have a bunch of avatars right now which is potentially a problem brick and
(00:33) mortar brick and mortar we're out of network insurance which is a dying which we'll get to reason we do 4.2 in Revenue you're mostly insurance or you're mostly cash mostly Insurance oh mostly Insurance out of network got yeah 4.2 want to get to 20 okay got it we have three offices and don't know exactly how to transition out of the dying business model obviously our industry is growing yeah so what business model are you thinking about switching to cash H I have a bunch of friends who are in network and murdering it in network yeah
(01:04) do why don't you get in network we've just heard It's a Grind Comm you know it's commoditized down the bottom race to the bottom yeah why do you feel like the wind that you have right now is dying from out of network uh because reimbursements from payers are declining each year whereas inflation cost going up um and because the amount of people who have out of network benefits is dwindling as well it's mostly just corporate um and that's even declining uh yeah they're just getting smarter and they want to push everyone in network so we're getting squeezed administrative
(01:35) burdens through the roof with prior R all this crazy [ __ ] so this is a therapy provider who bills Insurance he's dealing with an issue that a lot of uh out of network are dealing with which is that reimbursements AKA what insurance companies pay providers is going down but inflation and costs are going up and so that's squeezing their margins and for this individual he was making zero profit and so he felt like he needed to change his model quickly and so basically had two options you could go Network which is you have guaranteed
(02:02) customers but you're getting in a lot of ways like lower quality customers that you know government and things like that are paying for Mass Market insurance is paying for or you can go cash cash pay right like you can people can just pay privately for whatever you want and so he felt more aligned with the cash payment and so either way though I think understanding what strategy is required to win within each of those paths was kind of the real decision which is like what problem do you want to solve do you want to solve the problem of learning how to Market and sell customers because
(02:33) that's what it's like when you are in kind of the cash business right and if they've never done that before then that's a real that's a real Beast to get over on the other hand if you want to be in network then it's going to be a business all about operational efficiency it's about Returns on Capital and basically how efficiently you can staff up and how low you can keep costs across the business because you have no pricing power right so it has to all be off of efficiency and so those are basically the two paths that he had and
(02:56) so I wanted to walk him through the the kind of the questions to figure out out which of those he felt more aligned with and it sounded like he definitely wanted to go more the premium cash pay version and so that was kind of the direction that I let him in so you basically see it as like I could either go in network and then make your entire business model around operational efficiency um which is which is I mean I've got somebody who murder it doing that so I don't think there's anything wrong with that um or alternatively you just go premium be the best and be be
(03:24) private right be cash by so the question is how do you transition it yeah yeah I think we've decided as a team collectively we just don't want to be in network because of the lifestyle you know whatever I get it and who you deal with yeah yeah a pain um literally for you uh or really I guess for them uh so fundamentally I think you just have to think about this as basically starting a business over but with resources already you don't really have to think about the service you probably have to think about the packaging itself so like what's the what's the grand some offer for this
(03:52) yeah um and you'll you'll have a number of like you're you're just going to become a normal business which is just like you will run advertisements and you will make offers to people and they will come in and then they will take their credit card out and they will buy stuff from you um and so it's probably more that it conceptually feels complex more than it actually is and so it's probably a ripping the Band-Aid off thing which is that I would just out like so one is what channel of acquisition are you going to use I'm guessing right now is
(04:22) it mostly Word of Mouth yeah it's referrals okay business for a long time yeah so um one is you can start sell upselling existing customers so like obviously they have what's covered in from insurance but then um you know upselling other packages that'll get your team a little bit used to being like it's okay to pay us that's from like a really tactical level uh but from an acquisition perspective you've got content you've got Outreach and then you've got you've got paid ads right and alternatively you could have Affiliates
(04:46) so we have to pick so of those four things which ones do you feel like you are better suited so from Affiliates it's like uh go to shoot injury attorneys or like you want to find the the person that they're going to see prior to hitting you we've tried a bunch of that and the issue there is that they want to sent in network or if you're injury attorneys to workers comp cases which don't pay very well so so you don't want to go from that perspective so you don't want to do Affiliates content probably in my opinion probably
(05:11) isn't the the the best way um so then you have Outreach and you've got paid ads I'm going to bet paid ads is going to be your better bet since it's local it's pretty straightforward um operationally it's not complex like running paid ads in a local area is like pretty easy um you drop a pen you do you say we need more like so obviously we have a bunch of different types of avatars so like really now like how would you say going about you're probably going to end up finding that you have one to three offers that
(05:36) actually convert and then the remainder of your business will be upselling and cross- selling when they walk in the door so instead of thinking about your businesses having like you know we have 15 Services we advertise all 15 you're going to have one to three that convert really profitably on the front end and then the remainder of your business is cross selling and upselling so it's like you're going to have the most efficient door into your business and then you'll end up just cross selling and upselling people and retaining people from from
(05:58) from there and so like in terms of next steps it's you need to record an actual ad for an offer and then put it on meta and then drop a pin on the map and do a 10 mile radius hopefully all three are close together and you'll run the ad that'll then go to either a CRM or if you're low Tech you can just go to Google Sheets and then you can have your front desk call them within 60 seconds and then if they don't pick up call them again and get them booked because your time is valuable you'll probably want to consider running some sort of Highly
(06:29) discounted assess on the front end so that' be like a $200 yeah x-ray or something like that that they can get for 19 or 20 you don't care about that you just want a credit card on file so that when they walk in the door you have two things one is that when they walk in the door uh well one you you want them to walk in the door because they paid two you can charge a no- show fee if you want to um but typically if you're getting even a low ticket amount you'll be in the 70 to 80% sh rate so you won't waste uh so pay up
(06:55) front actually put out their credit card yeah yeah okay and just for the for the discount offer now when they come in the door you'll do the assessment and then after the assessment you don't treat them you'll do the sale appointment then you sell at point of greatest need not point of greatest satisfaction so at that point is when you'll make the offer um and then you'll be like hey awesome do you want to use the card we have on file because you already have it on file because you got it earlier and makes so
(07:16) much smoother sale so the issue he's dealing with that he's at he's at optimized stage he's 20 to 49 in terms of his headcount and the issue number one that he has is that he can't hire higher level talent because they expect full compensation and he basically has very little cash to bring in the talent that He needs right so that's number one issue that he's dealing with um he's spending money to grow but he's not growing money's missing and so that's an issue that he's dealing with in finance because he has so many kind of products and services the Improvement between
(07:46) those things has gone down and ads aren't converted basically he doesn't have any real ads or real way of getting customers in and so costs are going up right and so these are the issues he's dealing with which is really common at this stage now let's look at what he has to probably do in order to improve it and so he has to create customer segmentation by cohort and activation process and then install sales training uh for his team so that he can start segmenting people and upselling them down a customer Journey path instead of marketing all of these different
(08:17) products he basically needs to make one or two or three entrance points in the business then cross sell and upsell all of these additional services that might not convert as well in the front end but work very well for continuity or for upsells and down or even high ticket up sales on the back end and so he basically has to shift his perspective from somebody who builds Insurance that's just like whatever they take off the menu you know because Insurance encourages people to be like here's all the different services and this is what we pay for them and so people just try and offer lots of stuff once you have a
(08:45) cash business it's all about efficiency of acquisition you're trying to acquire customers as profitably as possible and then Ascend them to the highest LTV and so this is basically what he has to build is the sales system the uh the ad assembly process to increase the volume of people coming in segment the customers and then learn to head hunt higher level roles once he increases the cash flow got it does that help yeah definely that's what you have to do like you you have to learn how to acquire customers that are cash based and so that means that you have to run ads and
(09:11) you have to sell [ __ ] what would you do like if you were saying from a strategy standpoint like we have the current business that's doing 4.2 million in Revenue you're going to keep that business but your all of your discretionary resources are going to go towards this if you want to build build a bridge to tomorrow yeah should we do any of the more on the things that are still working within out ofet networ like it's really just a you know we have limited resources how much should we spend on each profit we're basically at
(09:37) zero oh [ __ ] yeah it's part of the problem yeah we waited yeah we wait longer than yeah yeah I understand because you can't control how you're reimbursed no but we can remove the lowest reimbursement reimbursing patients which is like remove Medicare then we can lower our cost structure we could go that route I think that would probably be the first thing that I would do and then you cash flow so yeah you you use the resources in terms of time and money to build the bridge that make sense yeah thanks a lot Alex yeah you bet so all of these things are on The
(10:09) Graduate list at this stage and that's because businesses behave in patterns by the way as a free gift for you if you like this scaling roadmap and would like to know where you're at you can go to acquisition. roadmap uh and plug in information and it'll spit it out for you exactly where you're at don't worry it's absolutely free so go enjoy it um if you want my team's actual help on the thank you page you can schedule a call and we'll see see if we can help you out hey Alex uh my name is Henry I sell uh
(10:32) education I teach people how to fix and flip uh mainly the Hispanic market so it's only in Spanish uh we did 1.3 mil last year uh second year in business and we want to do 3 million this year so with the more better new right right now uh we only do two events a year big events 600 people and we upsell to a high ticket uh 12,000 right and we convert 20% of the room more or less so that 80% that went to that room never sees me again I never sell them anything again okay and well that 20% they bought my high ticket the mentorship is a year
(11:10) sure and after that I don't sell them anything ever again okay so uh more or better do I just do more of these events and like NeverEnding looking for new customers for the rest of my life or I focus no you're good you're in education yeah and education graduates people yeah that's how Education Works so if you look at the education system overall the way to create continuity in education is just always have something else to learn or to teach right like first year now you're an undergrad now you're a graduate student now you have a masters then there's a PhD and you get a second PhD like you just you just keep
(11:44) you know people just become endless students and so do you want to sell the business eventually or do you just want to make money uh make money I mean we're not no it's fine no I prefer the truth um yeah I mean the easiest thing to do is just double the amount events you're doing either just do you can either go one a quarter or you can do two at 12200 and would you travel or just stay in where I'm at in Miami is that where you run them now in Miami yeah would do East Coast West Coast yeah yeah maybe Texas or something yeah okay so Henry is
(12:13) at the product tie stage and the issue that he's dealing with is that customers have nothing else to buy and turn literally right there first line and he says it himself all right and so in order to graduate he has to connect his customer success to product and then make something new to sell them which is the backend so I recommended he follow exact that advice um and create either a higher level thing or if he wants to build out a continuity that actually sticks maybe considered down selling something that's maybe a cheaper annual fee uh for continued access uh to some of his services and events but the big
(12:46) picture though was what does he want to do now if he just said I want to sell this company then we have to create some sort of Revenue retention so that it becomes valuable but for him he was like I just want to make more money and so then the obvious answer is like cool then just do way more and so instead of just the two events on one side of the US put two events on the other side just like that you can double the business with really no operational risk whatsoever I mean you have a really simple solution like just run the same
(13:10) Playbook more times if I would if you were like I want to build a more valuable business then I would say take the year to figure out Revenue retention which is how do I get these people who pay me $112,000 to pay me another $112,000 or pay me $30,000 next year or even downsell them to something that's $5,000 a year but they stay right and focus on retaining that top tier that paid me the high ticket yeah but I think considering for the model that you have downselling the upsell um I actually like a lot okay so
(13:37) if they paid you 12 maybe they'll stay for three year three to five um just to have access to the network and some of your vendors and the stuff that you kind of like provide um and I think that's something that people would be far more likely to stick with and so then you can basically think about your business as from a zooming all the way out perspective is that the $112,000 is actually going like offset CAC uh which is like you could break even the $12,000 if you know that someone gets into a $3,000 year membership that's pretty much all margin that doesn't leave so
(14:08) it's like that allows you to spend way more than your competition because they need to make money on the 12 you can break even on the 12 and then you just have the stack of $3,000 bills that just keep stacking up that's like low low effort to maintain got it that make sense yeah it's good the nice thing is that you're honest about just wanting to make more money it makes this a lot easier yeah yeah yeah don't say I want to make an impact so big make sure he's an education business and education businesses graduate customers because
(14:33) they teach you I mean if you do a good job you graduate that's kind of how School works right and so the real continuity and education is just more education right look at College then you have Masters then you have a PhD then you have a double PhD and then you're just crazy who knows all right so the point here though is that he could try and build a recurring Revenue stream from this business but in all likelihood his goal was just to make more money and so why add complexity if that's not his goal so I was like cool just run more events and do them in different areas so
(15:00) you attract different customers hey Alex thanks for everything that you've done uh I'm James I sell custom Branch railings to homeowners okay I we did 420 or so last year uh I was I've read 10x is greater than 2X and so last night I was coming to me again like do I really just want to double or do I want to try to 10x um and so what I want to try to do is to develop a network of product specifiers Architects designers contractors that can act kind of like a referral Network I want to shift away from the minnows and to focus more on whales we had one client last year about $50,000 worth of
(15:34) handrails and if I could get 10 of those in a year then I would double Revenue just with 10 clients so kind of what are my best strategies to go about achieving that so where did you Source the single whale this year he found me it's all inbound it's all through search okay so SEO or PBC SEO okay I just started Facebook ads about three or four weeks ago they're going pretty good qualified about half of the lead so far so I would so if you want to go whale hunting then I think your your initial thought strategy of finding the architectural firms and engineering firms and whatnot is a good one um I
(16:11) would probably try the Outreach method um as my primary way because you can be hyper targeted in terms of who you're reaching out to and the the key to making it work though is like what's in it for them to refer you business are you asking me that that's an excellent question Okay so Architects will typically in a plans like if they make a set of plans they'll specify what kind of tiles to use and what kind of Windows to use Etc so I've I've we've gotten plans in the past where it's like it's got the pictures from the website with the cad drawings and everything on the plans and so it's like how to persuade
(16:45) them to do that kind of In Absentia and I should also note that we ship Nationwide so this is not like you know a hyper loal are you shipping or you are you doing installs or no no we haven't done an inst are you just you just actually we just ship product interesting got it then who are the decision makers well right now it's been primarily residential is what it sounds like right it's primarily home owners we've done some commercial work you know but it's primarily homeowners who are you know looking for something different and so it's very what I call intentional
(17:16) inbound search it's like they're looking for something they are deliberately searching it out they find it you know we have uh a lead magnet kind of which is like 250 IDE it's SEO and I you know yeah well this is a fundamental change in business strategy so you're aware of that so with that comes risk because the highest risk adjusted return move or lowest risk I guess is probably adding like if I were like tomorrow what would I do I'd probably just add PPC in right now um because you already have something that's working on SEO I would
(17:45) probably see how can I get way more articles written so that my SEO traffic can go up can I tackle more you know more keywords um that's like the for sure will work and make you more money play the going after Wales for sure can make more money because why not add zeros to things um it'll just be a completely different sale and you'll have two levels of sales so sale number one is going to be for the Affiliates and then figuring out what's going to make it worth it for them and then the second level is what's you know what's
(18:13) the actual sale to the to the whale customer so what James has is he's using Affiliates to get customers which is this is inside of the leads book all right and so um Affiliates are businesses that have your customers that market and sell your stuff to them all right and so fundamentally I walk James through the three different ways that I have found that work best uh for Affiliates so who's the decision maker with the whales um like the final decision maker is going to be is going to be the homeowner whoever is doing the project
(18:46) but so you just want bigger homeowners the The Architects have the ability to specify it and to put it in front of the client so like we also did another one which was about 60,000 for a guy that was doing a development of airbn in in Virginia he put up like six YT kind of things and uh you know so I had two B very big so both of them were Architects that sent you these the one was an architect and the other was a construction company okay yeah so you're going to have to go B2B Outreach is the prime basically when you look at core 4
(19:15) that's going to be your what you're going to do and then they're going to be your Affiliates and so the the million-dollar question is what's in it for them so my my proposition would be so there's three ways you can do Affiliates at least you know in the world of Alex so you have they sell your [ __ ] for you and they and they get a commission that's option one that's typically my least favorite option but it is an option option two is that you give them some morsal of something that you sell that they can sell for 100% markup they could keep all the money but you get the introduction this is my
(19:51) favorite way of doing it the third way is that you um allow them to just bundle in your free thing with their services know with architectural firms it's not like they're going to bundle in a railing uh for their serice but just for everybody else like those are the three things so it's like they bundle your your basically your lead magnet in for free with their thing they sell so it makes it enhances the value of their Revol package you give them the things so they can upsell your lead magnet for an amount of money that they can keep 100% of or they just sell your stuff and
(20:20) they get a kickback is there a version for this where they can just upcharge like you can do a small portion of this that they get 100% of 100% like I don't think so like maybe some kind of contractors or architect discount we wanted them to be stupid to say now yeah because like the generic like you get 20% kickback is just like everyone does it like who here does 20% Kickbacks for anybody who refers your business you can raise your hand I'm not going to be upset okay and so the point is is that and you probably no one here has referred anyone else business and because no one cares that's that's kind
(20:56) of the point and so it has to be an irresistible offer and so if we give away the lead Magnet or some think about it as like my CAC for a $50,000 customer is the cost of the lead magnet and if I close one out of three introductions then it's 3x the cost of lead magnet is my cost to Aire customer which is usually pretty darn good so what I outline with James is right here on page 237 is that there's three ways you can integrate your product into their offer basically getting an affiliate to sell your stuff and so I order these from
(21:27) easiest to hardest so first you can give away your lead magnet with every purchase so they just give away your stuff for free uh in order to to get to get leads right so they'll sell their product with your lead Magnet or they'll just give your lead magnet away but either way you're not making anything from it they're just going to give it away second is that you can get them to sell your lead magnet separately to Their audience which is my preference right you give away something that has hard cost or real cost um and you let them sell it for whatever and then the
(21:52) cost to you is just the cost of delivering the thing right and so if I had a marker business right I might say I let you sell one of my markers and let's say my marker cost me0 50 uh for whatever you want to charge for it and they're like I can sell this marker for $5 I be like cool you sell it for $5 but I now have a contact of somebody who bought these markers and I might call them up and say hey you've got blue do you want red and do you want green and do you want black and all of these are $5 now my hard cost is just the 50 cents
(22:20) it cost me to deliver the marker and so the question is what percentage of customers do buy a blue marker byy the other three and so if I found out one out of two customers to buy a marker at0 50 cents end up buying these then my cost to acquire customer through Affiliates is 50 cents times two so the cost of delivering my lead magnet is the actual cost and here's the crazy part if they go make zillions of dollars selling your thing great it means that you're going to make even more money upselling your stuff and so a lot of people get very greedy about what other people are making off of their stuff just focus on
(22:55) the money you're making whether the deal makes sense for you that's one of the piece of advice that ilila actually taught me she said never count the other guy's money um and it's a really good piece of advice and I'll will pass it on to you but it sounds like an irresistible offer to the Architecture Firm because they're like we can just sell this and keep 100% you're like yep just make the introduction and I'll deliver that and then when you talk to the customer you're like yeah I'll deliver that here's one rail but you need 10 more and then you make the sale
(23:18) does that make sense I'm not entirely sure like people would order the entire project okay so it's not like you can just like I can't just ship you a sample and be like hey look here's a then you're going to have to do the commission B structure which is not my favorite but um that's probably the way you're going to have to do it so either you can do the discount I mean I would say guys I have 20% that I can play with here so you can take all 20 and give them no discount you can take a 10% discount and then they get and you get 10% Kickback like this is what I got I'll make it work whatever way you want
(23:47) but this is my bare bottom price okay and I think that's what like that's the outbound strategy so should I then in turn raise prices for direct consumer yeah I love that okay thank you yeah love that for you the reason I like that second offer because I think it's very compelling now obviously the third way you can do it is just get them to sell your offer and then have some sort of Kickback obviously many companies do this it has to be very compelling because almost every business I know is like yeah I give 20% at least in
(24:17) Services every business I know gives 20% uh you know Kickbacks for anybody who refers business their way it's like yeah but no one does anything with that and so it has to be enough that would really change someone's Behavior so think about it like this is that the offer has to be good enough that it changes what they do with their business if it doesn't change what they do the offer wasn't compelling enough or you made it too hard right so it's either make the thing better or make it easier for them my name is Cody um I sell roofs of people um we did 140 million uh last
(24:45) year trying to do 250 million uh this year trying to figure out how to follow the principle of giving away more uh you know guarantees and and bonuses when I have such high hard cost yeah and such a high ticket item yeah well what are gross margins right now uh 40% gross what's Net 10 to 15 okay got it um do you want to sell it or do you just want to keep it forever or well I actually just sold my roofing business and now we're part of a PE firm that that now I'm directing that that entire all so you the platform yes okay so you're the platform and how many tukens have they
(25:17) done eight got it how long has it been since they started uh about three four years um I I just got acquired 30 or we just closed 30 days ago and now they're trying to roll everything into my brain brand and I'm chaos spearhead yeah yeah got it okay so sorry go back to the original question now I have like better context on this so how do I give a uh you know follow the principle of of give away more value make the you know offer so good it's it's you know you got to feel dumb saying no when I have such high hard cost I you know I can't really do a money back guarantee I can't really
(25:47) give away more than a you know a roof well the question is is that the constraint like is that the thing that's limiting the growth of the business in in my theory yes because if I create a good enough offer then um I could roll that offer out to the other eight eight other brands and that would be the biggest amount of Leverage that I could deliver you know in the shortest amount of time and is everyone insurance-based that's why they acquired us because we're retail and so so so you're the only guy selling just new rubs everyone else is doing storm chasing and damage repair and [ __ ] like that correct and
(26:14) what they want us to do is bring the retail model to the other brands um and add another layer is we sell everything 100% virtually so no inhome appointments it's it's all you know digital and so that's what they that's the vision is is taking that you know Nationwide centralized sales virtually so you want an irresistible roof offer the greater the change the greater the risk that the change doesn't yield the outcome that you want in the business and so fundamentally you're always making a bet that you're going to get a higher return off of incurring the cost of change than it costs you to do the change right and
(26:44) so in this instance he is now you know 30 days in or 60 days post acquisition of his roofing company getting bought with seven other roofing companies and for them to try and combine them he's the one who's supposed to like lead the effort of combining all this stuff and so the idea of like let's let's change the offer the offer is one of the highest leverage things you can change but it also affects every Department it changes how you Bill it changes how you sell changes how you advertise it changes everything right which is why it can change a business overnight but it can also destroy a business overnight
(27:12) and so when I see a business that in agre between those eight has $140 million in revenue and $ 30-ish million doll in iida you're talking about a business that's got probably 300 to $400 million in Enterprise Value I would be very hesitant to immediately change something that's obviously working and so there's lesser degrees of change that have higher likelihoods of working that could still materially impact the business in terms of increasing the likelihood that it exits right and fundamentally I'm guessing that's what he wants to get his slice from centralizing the sales would allow them to decrease costs because they could not
(27:43) have guys on the road it's just cheaper to do it it's also easier to hire sales people who are remote all of these kind of Downstream cost savings the other benefit is that when you hire remotely you have access to a bigger pool so you can get better salespeople at lower prices who close more deals and they could cut down all the the real big cost for this business is sales people who are unproductive all right so people who are they're losing leads on people who can't close and so by reducing costs increasing talent and increasing sales
(28:11) utilization all three of those things reduce cost and increase Revenue which could disproportionately drive iida which is what that company is being valued on and so when I look at that I'm like this is a change that you have to do in order to sell the company and will result in revenue and E growth and so let's do this massive change first before risking the biscuit right because we might just found out that just from doing that we get a 25% increase in EA and that might be enough just bringing everything together plus adding the 25%
(28:41) you're like you might be right as rain and at that point why risk it I feel like if I were in your position the first thing that I would do would be centralize everything first without trying to change basically I wouldn't I would take the model that I already know works is what was your Revenue before you did the before you were acquired okay you're doing 20 so I would like in terms of introducing levels of change so this is actually pretty good for everybody like I I will typically not try and change like five things at once
(29:05) and so you centralizing all sales is going to get cost efficiency improvements and you're going to be able to have higher sales utilization so you probably cut off the bottom third of the Salesforce that's low performing that alone might give you a 25% lift in general because the best sales guys will take more of the sales and you'll have centralized all the costs like you have centralized all the cost right and so you'll have an increase in Revenue and a decrease in cost that's paired that would probably be my first step that was part of the acquisition deal that's the
(29:34) only way I did the acquisition is if they were going to give me full control and centralize all so but like I wouldn't I mean I know the question was about Roofing but like that's what I would do first and that will probably take you six months or more um realistically um in terms of in terms of the offer to roofs um an offer that's worked really well in Home Services is instead of being a money back guarantee um I position has a profit guarantee so it's like listen um you want your thing to be on time and on budget probably and so I guarantee that I will deliver it on
(30:06) time and on budget or I'll give you my profit which is 20% whatever and that way it's like you're not underwater and you still have 40% gross margin so you're not really losing on the deal um but then people are like okay so he's got skin in the game and so that's a way of closing significantly more deals because the two biggest um obstacles that well you would know this but in most Home Services it's on time on budget and probably for roofs it's like and how much am I going to be displaced how much it's going to interrupt my life and so I would put my guarantee around
(30:35) those items and then just have a marginal amount that's back but it's really just because all they don't so the big thing just for every with guarantees is that people don't want their money back they want the roof and so they just want to know that you care enough to make sure the roof gets delivered and so that's really the the solve for the guarantee is it just pays down risk of them not getting what they want and so as long as that gets accomplished you don't have to do it with money back you can just do it with
(30:57) some money back that gets him to say yes does that help does thank you perfect so he wanted a better offer despite all of those improvements and I was like okay I think I can I can think of something for you so if you if you look inside the offers book page 125 I talk about guarantees and so this is the guarantee formula and so whenever you're thinking about adding a guarantee like this is what I think through so if you don't X in ytime we will Z like that is fundamentally what a guarantee is and most people I see a lot of times people just say I guarantee it but that doesn't
(31:27) mean anything you have to say what the terms of the guarantee are on a timeline what do I get if you don't perform right and so with this business and some people he like well I can't give them money back guaranteed because I would just lose too much money understandable now if you have hard cost like he does then what we can do is we can just give something else we can either a lesser portion of money we can give something else for free and so the guarantee is a consideration it's what are we going to do to show you that we're just as
(31:52) invested as you in the outcome being positive right and so we basically incre we shift some of the risk from the customer onto us and this is this is all you're doing as a business when you do a guarantee is they take some risk of buying and you're saying no I'm going to take some of that risk and so sure you can take 100% but in this in this situation he'd be taking like 200% of the risk basically he'd be losing money right and so the idea is again you can add stuff so hey if you don't get what you want I can add things which is like hey if you don't hit your goal I'll add more time which does work as a sales
(32:23) tool sometimes though in the actual in the real world if someone's not getting a result they're like I don't want anymore from you I hate you right and so it does still work as a sale but it's one of those like mid right now alternatively you can go the reverse Direction which is take away negative which is a discount right so hey I can't give you all your money back but I can give you back my gross profit or I can give it back 20% or I give you back 10% right these are all things that you can choose to give back and the thing is is
(32:47) it just shows that you have skin in the game and all we have to think about this is the point of a guarantee so I want to make sure I'm very clear here the point of a guarantee is not to have the craziest guarantee the point of a guarantee is to maximize net conversion all right so we just need to increase sales more than we increase refunds so proportionally we net more sales and if you can just do 10% back then that's enough to change behavior and that's the point like if there's no difference between giving 25% back and giving 100% back in terms of the actual performance
(33:17) of the sale then give 25 and so you can move what you're guaranteeing in order to find The Sweet Spot and figure out what's actually compelling to your to your customer and most times the the things that you want to guarantee around are their biggest fears in Home Services stuff it's usually be around time and around budget right are they're getting it done on time they're getting around budget if it's other services it might be different than that and so you'll know your services better but you want to you want to list out what their biggest spheres are and then Crush those
(33:42) with the guarantee hey Alex hello thank you for the content you create my name is m fatel I'm the founder of Alan okay so basically we sell tools to creators help them make more money and we also simplify how Brands collaborate with creators okay you see tools like software so software and ser agency tools so we have a music label a Creator Agency for big creators and then a platform as well okay so I'm coming to that just in a bit I know the focus topic uh we made around 4.3 Million last year uh and basically my goal is try to
(34:12) get to 100 million right now the issue here is what's the split between the three in terms of Revenue uh 1 million for the Creator agency okay 1.3 million for uh the music label uh and then the rest is on the brand side okay my issue here I got 40,000 creators but only a thousand are making money M right and I've been kind of struggling between going on a SAS model to be able to scale because when I do any social marketing we get a creator that comes on board but they don't make money right away uhhuh so it's not like you're you know and the
(34:44) longer it takes you to recoup your ad spend is not usually a good metric for scalability so I'm kind of pivoting should I go into a SAS model where right whatever I make from the Creator I'll just be like hey like just pay me that price and I take 0% from you and then I just charge the brands the commission to collaborate with those creators this way I can scale the business in a much faster uh say the say the last part again so instead of me making percentages from creators yeah I provide them the same tools that allow them make make money and I keep 0% okay
(35:14) but then let's say they have to pay like 20 bucks a month sure but then I still make my money on the upside on the brand Side by connecting them with these creators okay so switch to a subscription switch to subscription yeah okay um cuz now like I have 40,000 creators who signed up but I'm really making money off a thousand right and it's free to sign up and you only get paid if they get paid yeah so um you're in a prosumer audience so if you look at like Shopify for example um it's super it's if you
(35:44) look at the amount of people who've tried to build marketplaces almost all of them fail and it's my opinion that the best marketplaces do run as SASS and then once they get to scale they can they can kind of push more Marketplace like shop Shopify for example like it's 29 bucks a month or whatever it is because they know that the vast majority like they make more money charging $29 a month and getting 4% on zero for the vast majority of stores but people continue to pay for the hope that someday they will make money um and so I
(36:15) think the idea of switching to SAS is not a bad one uh I am concerned about the four businesses that you have um so because in order to Win It SAS you have to be like all in on software and so the alternative to that would be instead of letting creators come on for free you would charge them to come on which you could do it has like a onetime setup fee and then maybe increase the likelihood that they win either path would work but if the ultimate goal is that you want to build a network of creators then you
(36:49) want to have the lowest barrier possible on the Creator side um so I'm still thinking of a free tier and a paid tier with some minor benefits but then if you really want to make money you got to end up paying subscription exactly yeah yeah you'll have to play with the feature set because that's always a a [ __ ] just the path of least resistance to getting to 100 Mil yeah so I think I think um adding the subscription for the base and then still maintaining the revenue that you get from the the the sponsors make sense I would maybe push
(37:19) back slightly on the hypothesis that they can't convert anything because it dramatically decreases the value of the network from the sponsor side what do you mean because some people will pay for Impressions yeah and so those guys can for sure deliver those and so maybe there's like two tiers that you can sell you have another product on the ad side or media side um it's just something to consider perfect thank you that's you just validated my thoughts so thank good just wanted to make sure I'm thinking the right way no I think it makes sense yeah either have to
(37:50) basically you have to position his higher ticket and do premium wake glub on boarding and then select only for the really good creators and that would be like you charge 5 or $10,000 and you really get them set up or you basically flip the other way go fremium um and then it's all based on like basically media Arbitrage where you're just running tons and tons of ads um to get people onto the platform and you just know what your average revenue per per platform user is perfect thank you y so this guy obviously has multiple businesses and he's you know sinning he's doing the cardinal sin of uh
(38:18) chasing multiple rabbits or more particularly many women in the red dress that being said I still wanted to help and so he wants to build a software company if that's really what he wants to build then he's got to go all in because if SAS is one of the most if not the most competitive space that's out there I guess now there's AI but SAS is still competitive everybody you're competing against has is typically very well funded and also very smart and so they're going to have significant advantage and so if you think that you
(38:42) can split your attention and still beat them it's a tall order right and so for him my whole goal is that at least he had Clarity on what he needs to do so that hopefully he get that business up and running as fast as possible uh so that he can basically shut off the other things and go all in hi Alex my name is Alex you can call me Alex Rodriguez and from Puerto Rico see from Puerto Rico so I'm a music attorney aado aado correct yeah so what we do is we have our constraint is focus yeah you think okay I have so at least you said it yeah yeah so we have firm uh so basically it's
(39:20) three businesses yeah uh but today thanks to Ed and Sammy we got uh much much more clear what we should do but I would like to know how would you think about this because the the law firm side it's growing 20% year-over-year without me actually doing anything just redirecting people that comes to me to my law um and right now it's about 100K MH and then we have the educational side and that is making 200k and it's been stuck like that in the last two years sure and we're building you get customers from organic yeah both
(39:58) are organic okay so if you don't have money to pay as as a lawyer you go to the educational platform and we are developing a contract uh automation software for big companies like major labels or publishing companies uh so right now the the product our software our goal with the software is to sell we are seeing that other that big music companies are buying Tech yeah so specific for them so they're doing everything manually we want to sell that but we have a cash flow problem because we're selling to you know people without a lot of money and the service size does
(40:36) uh make money so our our our problem is where should we focus yeah you're but your what's what's monthly turn right now on the it's on the soft we got 100 people and we only have 40 active right now and how long you been doing it in the first year so you've retained 40% are they actually active though um so they're paying the people that are active are paying $3,000 per year and there are only like four four four that are paying 3,000 and then what are the other 36 paying are paying 600 per year okay got it he has a very classic problem which is that you're good at
(41:10) doing something and you have two very different avatars and if you continue down either direction you ostracize the other so he's actually at the product High stage so he's 10 to you know 20 employees between the three companies the three companies that he has and so the issue that he has to have is he's got a niche down qualifi leads are too expensive and the cap his ability to advertise that's fundamentally his big issue right and so he's getting he's got too many different customers so we have to Niche down his his advertising and
(41:34) basically message the new offer which for him was going to be the education and the software and so the million-dollar question for him which is what forced me to say I think that it made sense was and this isn't this is rare for me uh but was for him to go down Market which means to go for the smaller customer that's more numerous most of the time you want to go up market and that's because those customers can afford to pay you like sell to the rich you know rich people pay better solve their problems that type of stuff I'm always always in that direction but because he said that 40%
(42:01) of his customers basically right off the onset were still paying him a year later to me that's fairly compelling that he's found some sort of product Market fit and so in hearing that I thought okay well Best in Class is like 60 plus% in your retention for a consumer prosumer type product which is where he was at which is musicians who like want to make it in business but it's aren't that big yet so to me that'd be a prosumer somebody who's you know a little bit of above a consumer kind of business e
(42:27) oriented s gig is right and so the good news is there's lots of them the other good news is that there's new ones that get minted every day and it's a growing market so all those things are in his favor which is again these are some of the reasons I like that the other piece is that he some of the old businesses he was going after I think though they are big I think they're going to have trouble over the next years with the AI stuff like I think they'll have a hard time pivoting and so I would be at least I would second guess going all in there
(42:50) not to say you can't I would just really consider it now the other piece of why I like this is that if he can move his Revenue retention up at the 12-month Mark then he has something that will just keep growing year over year over year because getting those customers is not hard keeping them is hard but if he can keep them then he can probably blow the doors off this thing especially if the education can offset uh his CA or cost to acire customer okay so I think we we we chatt about this last night so you have a there is no right answer but
(43:18) there is a path that you have to pick and so either you're going to be an Enterprise company and you're going to build only for that and I would say like you probably will just transact on the education side in order to fund this I in general don't like this plan but you could do this um because you'll be split attention and this is fundamentally why people raise money in software so they can just focus on one customer the whole time build the product and then actually get it to work okay that's that um
(43:44) because you said that you're retaining 40% in basically a um prerish Market which is where you're at I would be inclined to say that you probably are pretty close to a decent product um so you probably have nailed something there because keeping 40% of people one year later on you know whatever it is for musicians that you guys have for contracts and whatnot um you could absolutely go all in on that and get that to like 50 or 60% and then you just need to have a different acquisition system so you probably just need to go spend money acquiring customers and that already cash flows because of the education side
(44:24) and are the people who are still paying you on the software also educ customers or no they usually come from the education or from my legal services as well so I have some clients that be 80% of the job here the million dollar question the million dollar question is if they stop the education do they keep paying for the software yes because it's a one time Fe well then that's what what you mean the software is one time Fe no the education some they just pay and they're going to use the software as long as they so the only thing that we're solving for is revenue retention on the software and so like Enterprise
(44:56) in of itself is not more valuable than lower Market it's just it tends to be stickier which is what makes it more valuable but if you can get a larger Marketplace easier to acquire customer to stick as well as a large Enterprise customer you've got a gold mine if that's true and so if you want to go spend money acquire customers with the education or media as your liquidation and then get you know 100% like but the goal that you guys should have is like we don't care at all about the education all of your focus all the profit goes into just fixing one number which is
(45:26) that you need to look at M12 so month 12 retention um and just say like okay we're at 40 how do we get to 60 and then how do we get to 70 and that's all you're solving for because if you solve that then the thing will just keep growing and that's the beauty I mean that's fundamentally the beauty of software once you get it right is that it just keeps growing thank you yeah and so for me that was um I thought the higher likelihood path and also because you already knew how to get those customers whereas getting Sony and and some of these large Brands could be significantly more difficult and so for
(45:55) me I saw that and was like I think that's the direction that has a higher likelihood um of succeeding given their goals infinite banking yes insurance you have 29 agents yes and you're uh needing to decide whether you need to be the face and get customers to feed your agents or you should go all in on getting more agents and teaching them how to do lead gen yes cool um yeah so do the second one do the second yeah yeah it's it's significantly higher leverage cool so basically so think about this is what what problem do you want to solve so either you say I want
(46:36) to become a like you want to keep growing your brand top of funnel so that you just have more and more people are interested in INF Banking and then you have all these agents that you pass it off to so that they can you know basically transact and own the relationship so that's like option one um that is I would say the lower risk path because you're already doing that today and so how many how many is it on Instagram that you do your stuff or yeah all on meta and YouTube okay and we're get in what's your followership uh from that uh 15,000
(47:06) subscribers on YouTube and 12,000 followers on Instagram and 6,000 on Facebook yeah and what percentage of the leads come from that stuff versus whatever you do in person 15% come from online and okay where's the rest come from the rest of it comes from referrals and networking and dude get agents I don't even know talking about for sure get agents go get agents yeah I thought I thought it was like you 60 70% of the business was coming from from your organic no most of it's coming from for sure that and then the challenge with the agents we originally it was all me teaching people
(47:42) how to do that how to go go out there and get business go Network go join BNI Chamber of Commerce whatever that's what works for me and then we would get good people that were like hey I don't have any network so I said all right and they they asked where leads were and I said all right so let me go create leads and we started calling business owners CU that's who I was selling to but they were not showing up and they weren't really busy whatever we were offering wasn't whatever then I reread $100 million offers and $100 million leads and I looked at the value equation I said the best value I can give is to
(48:12) Real Estate Investors so let me go get real estate investor leads and then we're calling them all day long and the people that I'm hiring don't know how to communicate with them properly so the only they end up just setting up appointments and then they hand them back off to me okay and they're good but I think it comes down to recruiting people want leads the first go where do we get your leads well if you say you have to go generate your leads they might go look at somewhere where they give them leads so we started giving people leads so we make an offer to
(48:40) recruits that's good uhuh well I think that one is you could probably just take the existing brand that you have and just be more deliberate about the call to actions that you make and Bas because like if you talk about high level Insurance stuff that's going to attract both people who want to learn more about insurance but many of those people will be agents yes and so I think if you basically alternate the ctas you you'll be able to basically I don't want to say Chase two both you know both but in some ways you kind of can double dip here
(49:08) because as long as the content strategy fundamentally doesn't really change you're just changing really the call to action then you can kind of get a little bit of the best of both but I do think that the big thing that you need to crack is teaching them to generate their own own weights like that is 100 like that's the limiter of your business so you need to bring them on and you need to have the training system to get to reliably get them to self-generate like that's it like that's what you have to
(49:30) do if you do that the sky's limit and the 20 people that we have at of 29 that are just simply coming in and cold calling Real Estate Investors all day right now that are setting up an insane amount I think our offer is not great so I'm going to the drawing board with that but all those people now I got to go teach them I'm just teaching them how to cold call well they already are cold calling right huh they already are cold call they are cold calling now well they're coming in I'm teaching them cold
(49:54) call rather than coming in teaching them to go shake hands and kiss babies you want to teach them the highest efficiency strategy for getting customers so whatever that is so you can just like whatever your method is that you think that highest percentage of people will succeed with that's what you teach cool so whether it's shake hands kiss babies or it's cold calling whatever or a combo of both yeah or com either way is fine um but like fundamentally like look at the biggest insurance companies in the entire world they are that big for a reason and almost all of them they just they they
(50:23) are recruiting machines right like that's where fundamentally because like they're not a supply constraint business like you can sell as much insurance as you want right like you're not Supply constrainted right like you're just demand constrainted and so you just got to get guys and then put the system in place so that they learn how to sell and then that's the business heard heard thank you appreciate you yeah this is why there's higher leverage of him getting lead Getters than him getting leads so this is the leads book 175 so
(50:49) right now he's in scenario one which is that he's getting leads right he's getting customers and he's sending those leads to his agents to close right look at a much higher leverage move let's go to scenario three where he spends the same amount of time advertising but every time he's getting lead Getters and so every month he's getting more agents into the business and each of those agents are now getting money now it's the same level of effort for him look his line is still the same he's still working the same amount every day same amount every day but here he's got these
(51:19) new nodes that are generating business for him and so if you add up all of this these are all the extra customers that he's gotten just from this level of effort and so this has far higher leverage than this does which is why I recommended that he start making ctas in his content to both continue to generate because I don't want to kill the business continue to generate his normal leads but also make it clear for agents if they want to join him and gain access some of the leads that he has um that he can come in he can train them and he can show them how to get the leads on their own which he can benefit from uh my name
(51:50) is Mike Nathan um I sell cellular therapy in home to the old affluent injured probably and athletic um we're new but we've got a million dollars in Revenue half at evida um we would like to get the 25 million in home or in home okay got it we consider mobile Healthcare okay is it like guy drives out or is it you sending machines RN drives out gives you an IV infusion in your home okay got it um we like to get the 25 million we're built to be bought we want to exit so we think we're on The Cutting Edge of this what's stopping us is my team is awesome okay great and from the NFL to a lot of
(52:30) great we have great business to doctor B2B sales experience zero B Toc experience and that Playbook we're learning is wildly different we have no idea what we're doing yeah so what stops you from just doing way more of the doctor stuff um it doesn't it doesn't quite pay as well meaning uh we have people that knock on doors to uh orthopedic surgeons who are looking for patients with alternatives to surgery PT chiropractors it's a lot of effort and there's some that are going to refer to you and some that just will not yeah uh
(53:05) so that's our constraint in a one market we in the Twin Cities it's a one market uh play we know there are more people looking for this solution um so we want to understand what the B to C is if we go to then Dallas Philly La as we try to scale it we're convinced it needs to be a better Roi than maybe what we're doing right now what you so you're making 50% margins right so what's the cost to acquire a physician cost to acquire a physician M who refers you business cost of acquiring affiliate it's often times just it can be a physician so we don't
(53:40) track it that way but it's um $500 okay so it cost you 500 and then what does the average physician refer to you in a year uh in terms of business 6,000,000 so I mean you're getting 12 to one there and you already know how that works so like what stops you from doing 10 times more of that oh we you're saying they don't pay well but that's part I'm not sure you're we've went through the woods and hit all the people that are going to refer us the number is not amazing or at least I just know there's more there I assume there's more there's got to be more than the you know
(54:11) the 200 people we've hit in the like you you mean you've only really talked to 200 in terms of like reach outs and and or you have 200 who signed up as Affiliates kind of thing I don't know the number off the top of my head but it's in it's in the hundreds less than a thousand of B2B uh PT chiropractors orthopedic surgeons we've done that in the Twin C and the super small people that have given us has been some give four five and six some give zero yeah do you have an active affiliate manager who's like regularly reminding them yeah so with so the way
(54:43) that I think about Affiliates is um it's basically a second tier of customer and so you need to have somebody who's regularly kind of like stoking the affiliate fire to keep them activated and continue to get them to continue to refer business so I'll give you example so there was a a roofing company for it was a Restoration company um they had one star star salesman and all he did was he'd go around to other Tradesmen and get them to refer them business and so they would get a th000 bucks to refer the restoration business business but
(55:13) the sales guy got 500 for every time they referred and so that guy all day long was knocking on doors walking in the front door with donuts asking them how they're doing bringing coffee to the guys and then reminding them that they existed and that's all he did and so I think you were getting you're getting you're you're doing the hardest part which is getting them to uh refer you just didn't have the the consistent referrals because if you had 200 active Affiliates who were consistently referring your business and most of these Physicians you know especially
(55:43) like GPS things like that like I mean they see thousands of patients and many of them could probably benefit from the services you have and so the activation is both getting them to refer consistently but also uh percentage of customers that they see that they refer to you so it's kind of both sides of it and so I think that the missing link with what you were already doing was just that the you didn't have basically the continuous affiliate marketing strategy to get them to keep sending you business so that's probably like right now today I would fix that first because you already have the acquisition system
(56:12) you already have the network and so for me like reactivating that affiliate base would be the first thing that I did so this gentleman is using B2B Outreach to get uh Physicians and therapists to refer him business now the part of what he was missing is if you go to 240 in the leads book uh which is the Affiliates chapter um I talk about the launch and integrate model and so basically uh right now he actually was missing both of those so launch is like you want to do some sort of big promotion with them so that you get to all their customers now they were giving him like a trial customer and he was
(56:44) basically not getting any customers beyond that and so if he's acquired 200 Affiliates and each one of them is send him one customer it's cuz he's he's basically not following up with the test that they're making like imagine if you you know if you have a business and you you have customers and someone's taking you from your business you might be like I'll send you one and I'll see what they say right but it's a trial and so basically we have to think about getting these Affiliates on board is like a
(57:06) trial but to convert the affiliate into an activated affiliate right and so a launch is step one which is that okay maybe you succeed with the trial and then you propose hey let's do some big campaign to send a lot of your customers over uh and then you can make money we can make money everybody's happy but the long-term goal is full integration right which is at what point in your process can we uh integrate our business so that what you sell is merged with what we sell uh so that we don't have to do any
(57:31) extra work or remind you you just do it on your own the second thing maybe because you might just reactivate the base and all of a sudden you're like I got 200 guys for refering business holy [ __ ] we're at 10 million um but uh the second thing I would consider probably I would still probably Focus most of my time on the B2B because you already have it um but for this business I think that it lend itself for what's the price point $6,000 a treatment per treatment okay wait so so uh the average doctor
(57:56) will send you one $6,000 patient per year when he said it cost you 500 they'll send you one patient M interesting so do you have a process for once the patient gets the thing calling the physician up sorry say that so like I'm Dr Smith I send you Sandy Sandy goes and gets the well you come to Sandy and Sandy gets the treatment is there a cycle where you call back me Dr Smith and say hey we just dealt with Sandy here's some of her stuff uh not in a medical term like we're not putting notes back in because it is private for sure yeah yeah but we do we ask for more
(58:28) referrals there's a circle back that way there's not a a a patient loop back okay that's not true sometimes that does happen excuse me it does that's not systematized though yeah I would systematize the hell out of that because it's like hey you just sent me this person like let me close that Loop for you she's awesome we did this thing she loved it by the way and then we have the you know the opening to the to the other like what customers or customers sorry what patients did you see this week uh who you think it would be a good fit right and rather than saying you have any it's which ones would be is the
(58:59) question small training stuff but it matters um so I feel like there's so much on the B2B side that honestly that's probably where I'd be ripping so you would not go after a b Toc approach like advertising online going uh pushing in on a strategy on that it's not that I wouldn't it's that when I think about so this the difference in like theoretical and actual like I would given given the fact that you like you're already running good margins on this thing basically doing it and take this the way I mean it completely
(59:28) unoptimized like right now right and I again I'm not this is not a a slight um then I'm like there's so much juice left in this thing I don't want to now start something new it's like I barely got this one going I want to like crush this and when I when I'm like no we've like we follow up with every single person I've got a full-time affiliate manager who steps by our Affiliates I'm calling them Affiliates but doc you know drops by the docs once a week just to remind us say nice things hey by the way like that is happening all the time and we've already covered like literally Lally
(59:56) every single physician in the Twin Cities and I'm like okay let's go B to C but if we haven't completely squeezed the hell out of this thing and it's already working at the level it is right now with like zero like you're only getting one patient per Doc it's like so yeah so you getting B to B customer is the same as getting one B Toc customer I understand why you'd be frustrated because you'd be like well [ __ ] it I'll just [ __ ] I could sell One customer on my own without having to deal with the dock but the whole point is that like I
(1:00:20) want them to be sending 20 50 a month and they can because they have the volume and I think that first one has to be like a beautifully choreographed experience because that first patient's the test run for them for you right they'll refer you one and we'll see what happens right and so one it's like sy's got to be blown away right she's got to come back and be like oh my God that place was amazing and then you also have to go back to the dock and be like we blew Sandy Away by the way um and so I think you have to tackle it from both sides okay that's what I would do getting into the ad side you absolutely
(1:00:52) could do it and I'm could walk through some you know whole strategy there but I I if if we swap places that's where I would be focusing if you were G to try to expand into other major metros in the next 18 months yeah would you would you have the BTC sorted out before you went to the next Market or would you honestly no if I Crush my B2B play then I just run my BW playbook in B2B playbook in the new market like once I find something that works I just want to just do more yeah pillage right on thank you yeah no you bet now if you if there's no
(1:01:23) way to do that integration which there always is but if for some reason you're have limited beliefs throughout the world what you can do is basically you have to pay affiliate managers to consistently kind of they're kind of like account reps and so they manage the relationship with the Affiliates to remind them that you exist and remind them to promote your stuff and so if you have a handful of good Affiliates that can be worth their weight in gold because each of these business owners is is advertising on your behalf and so if
(1:01:46) he has 200 businesses which is what he said imagine harnessing the horsepower of 200 businesses of advertising and forcing it through one well if you have that he's easily going to hit his $25 million in sales he just needs to activate and better use the resources that he has at his supposal right now and on top of that he's already really profitable we still know the model works we just have to do more of it I'm a father single father I got two boys here and um oh my name is DJ kristoferson there we go I sell People to People I'm restarting my virtual Staffing Company
(1:02:15) cool and we're currently at zero Revenue it's just a matter of getting started okay and so we're really confident in that my question is on a more of a personal one so I'm a single father um in a serious relationship and she's not a business person at all very sweet and supporting but what would you say would be some things to prepare her for when it comes to so your spouse or not spouse your partner is stopping my my partner I mean she doesn't live at the house yet she's it's long distance but it's coming together but it's getting really serious okay preparing her for being married to a um type A I
(1:02:51) think you should give her a try before you buy yeah seriously how do you mean so fly out out spend two weeks with me I'm not going to cater to you I'm going to live my life if the way that I live my life the way this works this is how it's going to be if you like that let's rock and roll if you don't I don't want to change yeah that's true that's perfect no I love it that's that's great thank you crushed it I see the most important relationship that you have as you with your goals because your goals are really just a reflection of yourself and so I don't want to especially if I were
(1:03:29) single I wouldn't want to sacrifice my relationship with myself essentially for someone else the recommendation that I gave was what I would give myself which is be you and if the way that you want to live to maximize the likel that you do what you want to do with your life is this way then rather than try and compromise where both people don't get what they want try and see if there's somebody who actually just like really loves the way you live that felt like the easiest first step is like just have
(1:03:52) her come out and just don't accommodate like live the way you'd want to live and if she's thrilled about living that way then you have a very high high chance of this thing working out because you have little effort you're not pretending to be someone you're not you're not putting on a show you're just being you and if being you is enough that she stoked then you probably have a good life ahead of you now if she comes out and it's not the case then at least you didn't have to wait two years to find out after you both stopped acting that this is how you really are and so I see the goal as how
(1:04:23) do I get as far forward in the relationship as possible possible of what would it look like if neither of us acted and then let's just behave that way and if it still works that feels pretty good

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video i want to break down the difference between branding and direct response marketing and why not deeply understanding the differences costing you millions and millions of dollars and ultimately the amount of money that you probably want to make and if you don't know who i am my name is alex mozy i own acquisition.
(00:14) com it's a portfolio of companies that is about 85 million dollars a year in revenue all right i make these videos because i was once broke and i've learned a lot of lessons on the way and i don't want the pain that i experience to be in vain alright that's why i make these so that being said branding versus direct response i think this is one of the more interesting topics that i have dove into over the last year or so and it's come from a variety of different conversations i've had with top marketers and this morning i had a conversation with dean graciosi who
(00:42) is a phenomenal world-class marketer and we talked for like an hour this morning just about this concept of the difference between branding and direct response and i thought i would share some of the the lessons or discussion points that we had with you so that you can hopefully benefit and so the first point is that you may have heard this in my book 100 million offers but the longer you delay the ask the bigger the ask can be uh so for example you know if you're if you can use this in any situation whether you're you know
(01:07) courting a a lady or a guy or whatever you know if in the first five seconds you're like hey let's go home together it's like well you might have some audience to be willing to do that but the vast majority of people would not be willing to do that but if you date for you know six months then that might be something that would be almost everybody would be willing to do that after six months depending on whatever really beliefs that's not my point here but you can get the idea that a higher and higher percentage people would be
(01:27) willing to take you up on an offer if they spend more and more time with you and so the longer the delay the bigger the ask and the visual that i like to ascribe to this is the the longer the runway the bigger the plane that can take off and so the bigger the payload you can get based on the amount you delay to the same degree if you've seen um garyvee he's he's uh he's an influencer and and he owns a marketing agency out of new york and he spent i want to say 10 years or 12 years building his personal brand and then he
(01:54) finally had his ask which was hey buy my nft and then within the span of you know six months ended up making like a hundred million dollars from that nft launch right now i would make the argument that the nft launch itself was actually a director for its marketing play whereas everything prior to that was really about building the brand different examples of this that i think would be important to drive the point home and why i think that many many many marketers start in direct response and then end up in branding is because of
(02:19) one about to share with you so please listen closely to this if you are trying to make more money if you look at most big consumer brands you look at you know colgate or crest or you know shampoo brands right that have been here for a very long time they're not offering two for one deals they're not like hey go buy this toothpaste for 50 off right that's not actually what they're doing they're just talking about the products and if you look at some of these bigger celebrities that exist you look at dwayne johnson the rock built his huge
(02:46) brand and then said hey i'm offering i'm i'm starting this tequila guy you guys should check it out conor mcgregor conor mcgregor built up you know his personal brand then said hey check out proper 12. kylie jenner was like hey built up a brand and then she did her lip kits and so what's interesting is that brand people are now realizing is an amazing arbitrage opportunity for maximizing value and i think part of the reason behind this is that goodwill compounds faster than revenue does and so hear me out think through this with me if you've
(03:15) seen somebody who's consistently been selling and this may be you what happens is you provide value in some way and then you extract the value that you've the equity in the relationship through monetizing it through an ask or some sort of right hook as they say just getting them to try and buy something right and the thing is is that whenever you make an ask you decrease your goodwill right and so you kind of have to start over at zero again and then you build up goodwill and then you and you ask and then it goes back to zero again
(03:40) right so you're constantly depositing and extracting uh capital in the relationship and the hope is that it costs you less the deposit than you make on the extraction right like that's fundamentally what like traditional direct response marketing is at its most basic form right and the reason it is direct response is that we are actively requesting a direct reply or immediate action as a result of seeing our advertisement right of any kind to contrast that with branding what we're doing with branding is that we are
(04:12) reinforcing the values and the stories that people tell about our products and services all right so we're reinforcing stories versus asking for actions and you might be like well i you know branding doesn't make sense and i want to tell you this because when i started out my career i thought that every single company that did branding was i was like you guys are idiots if you guys understood how direct response worked you guys would make more money i'm such a genius blah blah blah blah and i was wrong as i often am and
(04:41) the more i study these massive companies i was like okay so all of these companies all do this type of marketing whereas little old me is doing this quick you know jab right hook whatever mark of just of just give ass give ask give us give ask and always just you know depositing enough value in order to extract the value later and the thing is is people get it people have seen it they know the game and yes it does work to a limited degree right but it's very very rare to find a massive massive direct response company i'm not saying
(05:12) they don't exist but i would say the preponderance of enormous companies are not direct response based companies and so why is that and i would pause it and this is my theory and this is what i talked to dean this morning about at length is the difference between direct response and branding is not the roi on the advertisement itself but on the time horizon with which we measure it all right and so in direct response you're always calculating your return on ad spend immediately rather than thinking can i build up this brand
(05:44) and then look at the return you're getting on that brand overall over an extended period of time and so i'll give you a classic example to illustrate the difference if i was selling t-shirts a direct response marketer might have a cool funny meme thing aggressively market it have upsells of two of two of the same shirts five of the same shirts getting on continuity for each meme shirt every month blah blah blah right that would be a typical direct response marketing plan not to say you can't make money doing it you can and that's this
(06:12) is the big exception i'm having here right is that like you can become a millionaire doing small games all right so i'm not saying you can't do it you absolutely can it's just that what type of game would you prefer to play and i can say that as i've i've aged or weathered in the game i continue to shift more and more towards branding but i do think there's a balance that needs to be struck but from a from a branding perspective in that same example it would be spending a year talking about what your values are the
(06:40) the stories that you want people to tell about you and your company and then you can simply put your brand on a t-shirt and people will pay a hundred dollars for it right and so then what is the return on the advertising you did for that year well if you can sell t-shirts for a hundred dollars rather trying to arb rather than trying to arbitrage you know meme t-shirts and discounts and bundling and doing all sorts of more complex things and just simply saying if you believe what we believe vote with your dollars about the things that you
(07:07) care about align with us and that's fundamentally what branding is when branding works very well is when what you are saying about your brand clarifies what people are already saying and so a lot of times people have a general gist of what your brand is hopefully it's what you want oftentimes it's not and this is especially true in the direct response marketing community at large because people say terrible things about the people who are doing their drug response and so their brand is the reputation and the things that
(07:36) other people say about you right and an example that elon musk gave in an interview i can't remember where he gave it he talked about how the consumer is the one that creates your brand he said if you look at i think he gave the example of toyota and ford but the point is not necessarily the brands but more so the message which is he said listen you know ford talked about being reliable and being high quality etc he said in toyota their marketing never said that and yet toyota is the company that's known for
(08:01) being reliable and high quality and things like that compared to the fords right he said so as much you can say whatever you want in the in the marketing messaging but it has to be true and so to my interpretation of that is what you want to do is give people the words to describe your brand that are true and just give them the words to say rather than trying to redefine the thoughts they have and i think that is really what comes to effective branding and doing that deliberately as an added point to that this is something that i
(08:30) got from grant cardone which has been one of one of the really deep and profound lessons i think i got from what our our two conversations we've had about marketing in general but one first off the many people who who don't like grant you have to appreciate how effective he is at promoting himself and his brand like you have to respect that all right you can you cannot like the man but you can app you must respect what his his level of effort and the outcome and the output of his effort right i personally have had nothing but
(08:58) positive interaction with the grant but my point is is that you have to respect that now that being said one of the things that he said that i have really taken with me is the one or two words that someone will associate with your brand he said when they think of me i want them to think this right and that is not uh you know this massive declarative you know value statement or mission statement because people don't care right nor do they remember hardly anything and so if you can get the masses to just remember oh yeah he's
(09:29) the real estate guy he's the business builder guy right which should be more aligned with what we do we build businesses and we take you know we buy interest in in information coaching e-learning type businesses that are in a niche and like that's what i want people to associate now they're not going to remember all the stuff that i just said but if i can just if they can just say like he's a digital business builder like he or like this digital business investor right either of those things would be things that i would say okay
(09:54) that's a positive association that's the type of association that i want people to make with my brand right and the thing is is that if i can wait a longer time which is why most people cannot do this and why i'm not saying you necessarily have to start branding day one but if you can be cognizant of what the message that you were relaying in your content and in the advertising that you do and i'm using advertising by the actual definition which is to make known right when you when you make your products and services known in the many
(10:21) ways that you do it if you can reinforce the simple message in every single thing people will begin as long as it's aligned with what's true to say the same things back to you and that will reinforce the cycle of who you are in the marketplace and what you stand for and so if branding is a higher roi activity overall i believe it is and i think that there's the many massive companies that exist out there would be great testaments and evidence to that point is that they don't engage in direct response marketing for the most
(10:52) part or even at all to the vast like the vast majority of the time they are talking much more about who they are and what they stand for right why they do what they do right and then people then buy their products and service in accordance with their values and they vote with their dollars about the things that they care about being the identity that they wish to associate with right and so i think that the reason seth godin started with direct response and then became and now talks exclusively about branding the reason simonson next
(11:19) started direct response and then talks way more about branding the reason that i started in direct response and talk much more about uh branding stuff now and at least that's my belief and where i think it's because that's where you make more money just over a longer time horizon and i think the reason that many direct response marketers burn out is because they don't like the brand that they are building for themselves which is why most people leave the space over a long enough time horizon and so that's why you don't see many i'm not saying
(11:44) there aren't any but the vast majority of direct response marketers tend to be younger one of the difficult things about this and i was having a good conversation with a friend about this is that because it is such a young space there are no there are not many people who have old lessons the the predominant education that exists in the space is people who are new the fact that someone can consider themselves a quote og in the internet marketing space after three years is laughable right it's laughable it's hilarious but it's true in that
(12:13) space it's very difficult to be an og because most people burn out because their brand equity drops so much right and so if the only way that we can build very big things is doing them the same thing over a long period of time then it would create the i don't say obvious but a natural conclusion that branding is the direction that more people end up going in once they have the ability to do so and so if you can delay the ask and you can have the resources and you can have the patience to build something bigger your goodwill
(12:42) will compound faster than your revenue will in a direct response marketing environment and so this is the concept around give give give rather than ask give give give comma give give give comma give give give get and what's interesting is that i think most people and the prospects that are consuming your your content and things like that they are waiting for the other shoe to drop they're waiting for you to make the ask and so they have their guard up but if you give give give and then right when they're expecting
(13:16) you to ask give again and then again and give even more their guard begins to drop and then they start to think man this guy or this gal is awesome i really like this person and then something interesting happens they start telling people about you because they don't believe that they're sacrificing their own brand equity by sharing your message that is where the compounding effects of word of mouth start to take off and so when i say that goodwill compounds faster than revenue it's because in the traditional example
(13:44) it would be give give give ask and this isn't me poo poo and gary or anything like that i mean i think that very much at least establishing that cadence is useful for most people who are doing a response direct response at least give something before you ask right but if rather than asking right where you have to start over at zero because you build you build equity build value in the relationship and then you asking you back down to zero and then you build it then you go back down to zero and then you're basically always
(14:06) capped by the amount of value that you have in the relationship that's the cap right but the alternative if you were to look at this visually would be give give give give give give give give and then it keeps going the chart keeps going off and then at a certain point a certain percentage of that audience because they have they are reciprocal in nature type people they will take steps towards you without you even asking simply because they believe so strongly in what you have and those the types of clients right that you want to be able to take
(14:36) on it just takes patience to get there but when you have those types of clients they get better results they pay for bigger premiums and it also gives you implied scarcity within your products and services and you are always underselling your demand which will essentially eliminate your bottleneck that you have in growing because you always have more demand than you can possibly handle and that is the benefit of building the brand over the long term rather than simply the the one two punches in order to extract capital today and so if you
(15:04) can delay the amount of time that you have between when you provide value and when you ask and ideally you never do you simply allow the goodwill to continue to compound allow the word of mouth to continue to grow to the point where you start receiving money probably far far further in the future than you are now and what you are accustomed to doing but in that future state you can then look at the minimal amount that you're spending right in order to distribute your message to advertise right to make known and then you will
(15:30) see that you have significantly higher returns on your advertising efforts it just took longer to get there and so understanding the difference between branding and direct response and having a longer term perspective and looking at the ogs in the space or lack thereof and the people who have transitioned from direct response to branding i think that there is a lot of lessons that we can take from it and this is just one of them that i wanted to share with you and if you're new to the channel welcome to mozy nation i said this earlier but our
(15:53) portfolio is about 85 million a year it's actually a little higher than that i just try to stay consistent but i think it's probably over 100 now but i i make these videos because i struggled a lot coming up and i and i just i hope that you know the pain that i went through is not for nothing and so that's why i make these videos so we i just i just hope you like it so anyways keep being awesome and i'll see you guys in the next vid

(00:00) in this video i'm gonna break down one of the stories that impacted my life the most and hopefully how you can learn from it so i wasn't that great of a person when i graduated high school i think i was really self-centered it was always about me and what everyone could do for me everything i wanted was just like respect and status and maybe that hasn't changed i've just gotten better at it i don't know i want to share with you a conversation that changed my life if you don't know i am my name is ashmosey own acquisition.com it's a
(00:25) portfolio of companies of 85 million a year this particular story was after my first semester of college i went to an all guy school in high school and i went to vanderbilt for my undergrad and i had acquired a pretty bad reputation in my opinion in high school by being kind of uh promiscuous for lack of utter term i you know i was known as a womanizer and i just didn't generally have a very good reputation at least one that i wasn't proud of and so when i went to college i was like okay it's my chance to start
(00:49) fresh and it's a much bigger school so you know my transgressions won't be as known because there's way more people and the first you know three months of my college career i did everything that i was doing in high school on steroids i did more of everything i drank more i went out more i ended up having a a one i think a one nine gpa going inside i basically had these report cards from my teachers that were like halfway through the first semester that were sent home that were like your son is failing basically every class and so my dad
(01:19) called me up and was like if you're gonna do this like you can do this it's here for free and not do this at college right and so i went home and i was like how do i get these people to stop talking all the smack like there was this thing back in the day called juicy campus which was like a gossip form and ended up getting shut down because there was so much hate on it but there was like this massive massive threat about me and how i was just like a total warmanizer and all the stuff i felt horrible you know i mean
(01:41) you can imagine like the younger version of yourself that's really sensitive to like what everyone says about you and so i i just went to my dad and i was like how do i change what they're saying how do i get them to say good things and it sounds to say this now but what he said to me changed my life and he looked at me in the eyes and he was like why are you trying to change people's perception of you when you can just change who you are and let their perceptions catch up the only way you're going to change your reputation is by
(02:06) being different he's like you need to stop being this person that does all these things and your reputation will catch up and even if it doesn't you'll always know i and honestly it barely scratched the surface because my ego was so high and i was like no i just have to think of a better way to like market myself but i ended up knowing that he was very serious about the threat of pulling me out of school if i didn't get my grades up and so what i ended up doing for the next half of the semester of my first semester freshman year is i
(02:31) didn't go out at all i didn't drink anymore i really didn't like hang out with girls at all and all i did was study and i was able to pull my it might have been 1-2 it was very low up to a 3.2 for the semester which basically meant i got an a on everything from that point for the rest of the semester and so when i went back home he was like well now you know you can do it and so we should always expect that that is what you're going to get from here on out and it also kind of proved it to myself too i was like i guess i can do
(02:54) this and you know what happened is after i started switching that way people still thought of me as a and i still had to deal with that it took like two years to really reverse the reputation that i had acquired in the first three months i think during that period of time i grew an appreciation for how easy it is especially in first impressions to set the wrong one and how hard it is to overcome a negative impression and my reputation overall the realization i had was there's too many people that you're interacting with in the world to try and
(03:25) curate reputation the only way to change your reputation is to change who you are reputation is fundamentally just what people say about you to your face and behind your back i'm not saying that you need to care about what everyone else thinks that's not really the point of this it's much more if one person says you're an whatever if every person you know says you're an like you might be an and so if you have one of those situations where you feel like the proof or the evidence is overwhelming and you might even believe
(03:49) it then it's probably you i think that for me getting out of the whole like i can control this and try and curate what people think about me and transitioning to be like at the end of the day i'm the only person who knows who i am and i don't like who i am and just saying like well how can i get to a point where i would like me even if everyone else hated me how can i like me when i started operating from that place it really changed my life because then i started thinking like what version of me do i want to be and what does that guy
(04:14) do well that guy studies really hard and that guy works out really hard and that guy's a really good friend he's always respectful doesn't have an ego and it took me a long time and i still work on that stuff you know i'm not saying i'm done by any any search imagination but i think that if you can simply shift the perspective of like i'm going to try and appear this way to like i want to be this way if it just so happens to get captured great and if it doesn't great and there's this this quote by epic cheetahs that i'm probably going to
(04:42) butcher but he says if you need someone else to tell you something about yourself you are out of integrity because you can always be your own witness i think that that's a great point to wrap the this little video lesson up with because that piece strikes to the core of everything which is we are our own witnesses and if we want to change our reputation we need to change our reputation with ourselves first and then eventually it will reflect in the world and this has just been very telling for me because like
(05:11) more and more people recognize me every day when i'm walking around and i'm like jeez like i don't have any room for having a bad day like if i'm out to dinner and like i'm just like not concentrating and i'm short with the waiter and the waiter recognizes me then you know he's like this guy's an or whatever and so i guess in some ways it's like you can pretend like you're famous because you are to yourself and so i will leave you with that mosey nation if you're new to the channel welcome lots of love and i'll see you

10 Millionaires Asked Me How to Get Richer - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6m6DCQMASEM

Transcript:
(00:00) I'm here with 10 business owners doing between1 million and $10 million per year and we're talking about the things that are holding them back to scale their companies enjoy what are your biggest issues right now with growing your business two I think it's a marketing problem for us okay not enough ads not enough creative I think the my eyes have been opened to what it actually takes to scale advertising campaigns basically we have scaled our entire um program on single I lead for ads on LinkedIn that's Linkin Linkin
(00:30) iing sing professionals tarting we can Target it really well the leag quality is amazing okay what's LTB uh so this has been slightly miscalculated because we completely revamped our business in the last 1 months from what I could GA it was about 3.
(00:53) 7 and but that's not capturing the people who are actually staying longer at the moment so I think it's slightly high but conservatively 3. so yeah okay yeah got it so um what are you charging uh so we have one program but there's three timelines three packages a 3 month 6 month 12 month 2K 3K 5K okay 2K 3K 5K got it why do you have uh if it's one thing with just different timelines do you just start high and then work your way down is that all no I just present three options depending on the pass okay um what's the most common goal um probably losing 30s a six month program is definitely the most popular by yeah so um I mean this is super tactical but obviously I've done a lot
(01:36) of Fitness sales um I would probably just switch to a diagnostic sale okay so basically you say it's uh what was the what was the 12mth price 5K yeah yeah so I would probably do something like um 129 a week something like that and then uh just say Okay cool so you're here you want to get here that's you know you're you're 200 you want to be 160 it's 40 lbs and so uh that's we lose comfortably a pound a week and that includes kind of our Recon period at the end to kind of like bring you back to maintenance blah blah blah blah blah um and so that'll
(02:10) take us 40 weeks and so 40 weeks times 129 boom and that way and the key part is that as soon as you do that you're selling the goal rather than selling programs you'll convert a way higher percentage of people and then that's where I I gave my um the whole uh if you don't hit the goal by that point I'll keep working with you until you do provided you XY Z and that murders and that way because then I translate that which means that when you buy this you'll be that way whether it takes this time or this time you'll get there and as soon as I said that people like done here here's the card yeah great so I
(02:45) would just do that as like Thing Thing One um but in terms of the LTV so that that'll probably help LTV a little bit because you'll um and if you like need to extend time to make the contract H just have like longer maintenance periods huh yeah yeah yeah yeah it's fine yeah I'll leave it there um do you do supplement sales do you have an affiliate thing for supplements we do no okay I would add that in because you can usually get another 50% in supplement sales because people want to get all the fancy dude ads and there's zero delivery
(03:15) for you yeah and they want the recommendation and so like literally you just hand them the product you make the split and then you just move on with your life and don't sell it on the first package sell it on the second so you do your diagnostic meet with them 48 hours later for nutrition consult then try and sell probably 500 2,000 bucks in supplements 100% more would you have a sales person to I no I Ed the same same guy he's like cool we're going to walk you through and first half is a nutrition consult yeah and then the second half you basically bake in hey I want you to take this at this time and you want to do it like in assumed close
(03:45) which is like I need you to take this this and this and then you go into their habit so it's like what do you do in the morning what do you do in the afternoon um so you have your coffee in the morning Force think okay want you put these three supplements next to your coffee that we don't forget it okay where are you going to be going to the gym okay I want you to put your pre-workout and your post-workout in your car we don't forget it okay you're going to take two scoops of that this one great by the way do you want to use the card you have on file for this awesome I'll have them shipped to your
(04:08) house sense cool um but yeah this that'll just make you more money but um the issue we're talking about is you growing your business um w't you spend more money on ads um we do find we struggle to kind of uh remain profitable once we start getting above like 1,500 a day in that spend so again the was me creating enough ads yeah that's it yeah so that's kind of what it came to from the last couple of days we are we are bringing the sales team in as well so I I've been training those guys and that's been a little bit of a constraint but they're
(04:44) closing plus 40% yeah so that's not a you shouldn't be should get ads yeah yeah that makes sense cool awesome good all right rock and roll FR so um my main constraint right now is the quality of the leads we're getting getting a lot of leads but there are low salaries basically profiles and uh we need so we compensate implementing a R1 R2 Sal process you know like qualifying P 10 minutes and then you go on this and so what we are trying to do is to get to the higher salaries and with more seniority where the the ROI for our is
(05:23) better uh so we are thinking about changing the platform where we spend our ads we're spending around 10K a month a bit more uh on meta ads only and maybe switch to LinkedIn or Twitter or I mean LinkedIn will for sure murder for what you're looking for like I mean you're looking for executives who want Seance packages or cold Outreach now or what cold Outreach um cold Outreach I mean I would I would do link if I had to do this in order I would one I wouldn't turn off your meta ads I would yeah I wouldn't like don't stop a flow like
(06:01) keep like you're making money with it right so then just make more money by doing the other thing on top like don't stop that um okay Sor it's my just saying it test other by all means test other things but what's the return on this one again I know you told me less than I can remember to 3 to one but we talked about uh just add in the performance piece so if you added the performance piece and you were doing 10 to one would you care that would be fine yeah I I mean I concur it'll be fine as well well then it's only me this if if you were getting 10 to one would you spend more on
(06:33) meta we tried to spend more but then the the some diminishing returns well of course there but now you got 10 to one but then you can get three to one with 10 times a spend yeah we need to more creative we need to to do more creative every week okay so I think so we talked about this last night but I think that you add in that performance thing would be like step one and I think that that takes you from 3K to like 10K or or 12K right per customer right so that takes you from 1 to 3 or 3: 1 to 12:1 if you
(07:05) just made that one change M so the diminishing return which goes from 3: 1 to 2:1 means you go from 12 to 1 to 9 to one so you're still killing right so sure I'll bet your ads could use work sure you spend 10 grand a month you're not spending money anyways but um I would do that first before I even start another platform okay because you might just be fine and just need to like tweak the LTV M okay just do that okay sweet yeah cool uh biggest concern right now is sales yeah uh sales manager left because he was not a good culture fan [ __ ] an [ __ ] or you an [ __ ] he's the good guy who knows you who
(07:54) knows yeah the plot thickens but he left uh top closer became sales manager second top closer left went to another offer so sales went from you know one point top closer becomes manager yeah a a song as old as time yeah okay so it's a really a sales problem right now that we have and uh Lea was just up there telling somebody to like hey you need to go back into sales I just don't have the expertise in sales so my solution is to hire a sales director on top of the sales manager h i mean you did wholesaling for
(08:30) a long time like you know what to sell y you also believe in the product well how many how many deals are you doing in a month right now so we were doing around 70 now we're doing around 40 okay yeah that'd be tough for you to take go the calls but you're saying you don't have the expertise to be a sales director basically I mean I'm pretty much doing it I mean you're doing it now right yeah I'm doing it now it's just like do I let yeah how deep do I get into it or do I find somebody else who has cuz all the other departments I have a director who
(09:01) so is lead flow the same and you went from closing 70 to closing 40 right right and it's really now the remaining team is closing the same percentage and just the two best guys left Yes except now that this sales manager this top coach became sales manager it's almost like a respect thing like he's not a very good coach in my opinion of course not he's the best clacher is a killer yeah and so that's kind of what the issue is and then those the current you have 100 trying to farm yeah yeah trying to develop people just wants to kill people um yeah it's like also like they were all as competition like a week ago
(09:38) and now he's like now I'm G to help you [ __ ] you um is he still on the phones the director yeah right so um one I'm sure she probably told you like don't promote the sales director uh the sales guy when you did say it were you like are we going to try this out uh I said there's so the last sales manager was paying him under the table to do like call reviews do this thing that so then I was like well why the [ __ ] am I paying this guy when you're doing all the work and then he became sales manager and now it's yeah I'm so weirded out by this whole
(10:14) thing um okay but he was so he was closing and doing the stuff and he was closing great and now that he's no longer closing he's doing he's just dedicated he was just doing calls right bad okay so so just reviewing their calls with them yes okay so um all right so I'll I'll walk through it okay so I'm going to give you like Sales Training 101 on this but um I honestly just think everyone sucks at sales training so I don't think it's a a you thing or anything like that I think literally like 95% of compan have no
(10:44) idea how to train sales and they just hire sales people and hope for the best and then they just like talk at them and hope that they get better but have zero measurable Improvement to show that they can actually take someone and make them better um so anyways that's like a a side side rant on that but um people get better at sales by watching a ton of game tape of people who sell well one by modeling just like children learn anything and then two by corrective very immediate role playing like when this happens what do you say and so they say great say it again like this try again awesome keep going try it
(11:21) again great one more time again and that's it and you just really drill one aspect of the script until they breathe it and they're like I get it I get it I get it I know like and then you're like great now we will work on the second part of the script and you just work your way down until they like they breathe it and think it and they can't do anything but that that way they can actually listen on the call because they're not thinking about what they're going to say next and so you need somebody who like
(11:44) really really loves salese and like wants to teach and invest in people which is not usually the personality of a sales killer every once in a while you'll have an absolute Savage but it's usually not that person it's like the salesman who's like like a killer killer is not that guy and those guys usually crush on sales there's a different type of closer who's like really attentive and like very caring and those guys can also kill and those sometimes are the ones who can become really good sales managers but it's a different
(12:13) Persona like Jacob if you met Jacob oh there you go right like he closes exceptionally well um when he was at gym launch and like he worked his way up from the call Floor to the setting team to the closing team beat all grown ass men and he was selling to 42y old gym owners like male gym owners um and then was able to train because it was like I just want to help the guys out you know like I understand what we're struggling with like let's just work on this and it's more about like I just want to win
(12:45) it whatever I do not because I am a psychopath which the one like you know who I'm talking about like the butch The Butcher of blavin um like we've all had those guys so your problem sales lead flow is the same so should you hire or should you get in is the question correct I think you should get in you have a sales driven business you're the CEO you should know how it works you're going to keep running this issue and whoever runs sales is going to have leverage over you until you know how to do it like if if a sales director you a
(13:23) sales record can be like no one can run this team like me if you don't double my pay I'm leaving I'd be like like I can name 10 people like in this building who can do it better than you CU trained all of them you know what I mean and so um what what happens so what happens from the team you had and then I'll go to Jacob um is you basically brought as many people as you could in Saw who could sell and then just let them themselves that's how most people do it nothing wrong with that what happens though is
(13:57) that there's no process and so so basically it's just whatever way you know how to sell sell it creates difficulty on the Cs side because everyone kind of promises a little bit differently some people sell hot they over promise blah blah blah blah blah and so even if you do try and train no one's following the script to begin with so the training is irrelevant and so basically like step one if you have to turn around a sales team is like everyone followed the script the script becomes it's like the script becomes the
(14:22) Bible it's like if this is word of God now that means that if you follow the script perfectly and they don't close you crushed it because if I get every following the script now we can tweak the script because that actually changes how everyone says it that make sense yeah so otherwise if no one says a script to begin with why do we even bother having a script gotcha and so do you think it's going to be more on script script making changing the flow and process and then training yes and making the script as simple as humanly possible okay most times when we look at
(14:50) a script we cut half of it got it is it me taking sales calls I think it would I think it would help you to better iterate the script to that teach it cool you'll bet I'll bet you there's parts of script like we don't even have to have this I took five calls you're like I can just skip over this whole thing why are you here what's the problem T cool yeah no worries seor Auto Sales do you auto sales training or you do Auto Sales Auto Sales okay got it got it got it do you have a dealership or do you oh sweet car use yeah oh cool how long you been in it eight years okay you
(15:26) like it I love it actually I I really do um long story short I've never been in sales I was never a Salesman I was a pipe fitter a pipe welder okay I bought some cars and said how hard can it be yeah and so I've just kind of been pile driving through it and um here we sit I love it um it's a hell eight years it's awesome from pipe welding to to have you know I know I saw your your uh your numbers is great so now I think the bu key man problems right [Music] um sales processes um scripting I talked to Jacob about that um we don't like I I can do it but how to teach you how to do
(16:14) it like that's I don't know you know like it's just go talk to him like I don't you know um so I think coming up with that plan um the advertising piece um we've been branding for a long time probably wrong I think I'm really kind of like me too like radio we've been doing a lot of radio and it's actually worked I feel like but I I think digging into the Social Media stuff would kind of accelerate it um and I talked I don't know the CEO gu the um I don't remember I talked to him I've got commercial Vans um
(17:01) so I got kind of two three four five facets of my business that we can do Comm like I have access to like massive amounts of commercial Vans um and so I'm thinking I'm going to do like a specialized push on that and see how that does because my margins in the Vans you know what I can sell a typical car for there's $2,000 of margin uh this van I can make anywhere from 6 to 12 wow um so why not sell $6 to 12,000 deals instead of $102,000 deals preaching to me man yeah so I think he said you know throw throw money at it test that and but because he said maybe you don't have the
(17:45) market to sell 30 Vans a month in this in that local market yeah I mean if it's a profitable line then yeah line of business um so I think really it's just ironing out like from top to bottom obviously we need more money like I to fill my position I haven't really taken any money out I've just like that's why you keep buying more cars well yeah we've gone from 15 to 30 to 45 now we have 100 on the lot yeah awesome plus I have a full-time service shop uh so I need to hire a mechan another mechanic I'm working on a service riter he's got to learn how to
(18:21) sell oh I get it the sales you know what I mean so like the one thing I've realized with the auto with three people it's super simple the minute you try to build like holy [ __ ] you need a lot of money yeah yeah I mean I think like you know the how much the franchises cost for like a BMW franchise or like they're unbelievable they're super expensive for you guys know it's unbelievably expensive uh like I think was like what 20 30 million something like that well and then tomorrow they just show up with a truckload of tools that you've got to write a check for you
(18:56) owe us 150 grand for context like that's almost as much as it cost to start Bank like but to be fair like there's the whole financing arm is a part of the business anyways okay not to get into the car business too much okay so um biggest limiter on your business is so one you you brought up branding you brought up leads you brought up uh picking the products s you brought up sales process so honestly I think you need priorities so it's like okay of the ones that we just went over which is the you know the biggest problem for the business what's limiting you the most to me hearing all that when I hear like six
(19:28) problems it's people you need help and I I there was something in the first day it was like you don't have problems you just need people to help you yeah and that I think is but I need to be you're missing like three smart people right I'm serious you're missing like three you need somebody who can run the whole mechanic division the service department you need someone who can run that and you get someone who can run the normal used car lot and then you can then take the Excess band with and be like all I'm going to pursue this van opportunity but like you can't pursue a new opportunity where you got another new opport which
(19:59) is the service business which you're spinning up you still have to keep the wheels on pun intended the the main the core you know the core Cash Cow business um so I would be looking at uh how much how much uh are you doing in the business how much what uh profit so I didn't bring that number with it I was looking through it I think I think I'm around 5 600,000 okay so I think you can get somebody so one honestly man I think do you have a good Finance person who works for you yeah okay so I'll bet you I'll bet you right now this it's just me just
(20:34) talk like shooting from the I'll bet you could probably get close to doubling your margin just from somebody who had some Finance discipline being like let's look at all of these expenses and just do that as a regular discipline at the very basic i' say like you could do that because you I I almost guarantee you can find 250,000 a year from your top line versus your bottom line and if you find that then you can find the like you can bring someone in and say find your salary like to a good a good controller or a good CFO you just say like listen I
(21:04) can't afford you I'm willing to pay you this you need to find your salary and cost in the next 90 days and they'll find it and they say cool I just bought you let's see what else we can find because I need help doing this find that carve that guy out too so you're talking hiring someone that's going to like just run the dayto day of the money I think I mean the perfect hire for you would be somebody who's taken a business around that was like 5 to 10 million in uh in sales not car sales but like receivables right for the for a dealership to 25 to 30 and has strong
(21:44) financial background if you don't have that then just the operation side would be helpful the reason I would put the finance person first is because it's likely that they'll be able to carve themselves out and carve out the hole for the other guy who can then fill that up the perfect guy would have both in awesome but if you can't find that guy then it'd be like I would want somebody from another car dealership who's been a little bit bigger who has more Finance discipline and I'd find somebody who's grown uh and run like LED uh one of
(22:11) those businesses and bring those guys in because that will free you up because like you can go get the the van thing and you'll if you have space you'll pay for both of those guys well I've so I've already got 40 bands I meant you'll pay like you'll make the money with your free time to cover their salaries yeah exactly I think you're at the point right now where you need to you need to make a bet on trading you need to buy some time for you back and it's just that the time that you now need to buy is more expensive time it's easy to make
(22:44) the Early Trades because it's like lower value skill but as you get better you just have to it's kind of like breaking into a new territory for ads like people are like I've never spent more than $5,000 a day I've never spent more than $110,000 a day I've never spent more than 100 Grand a day and it's like you just they're just like new territories and the same thing with uh Talent it's like I've never paid someone 250 Grand a year I've never paid someone 500 Grand a year never paid someone a million dollars a year like they just become levels that you just get through and then you find what different levels of
(23:11) talent look like and so right now I think you just have never paid someone what you're going to have to pay this person who's not a salesperson so I have I have like a sales slash finding it like we kind of do our own deals here I'm only going to move on to this one cuz I got 60 and I want to hit to everybody but no you're but hopefully that that gives you at least some direction okay cool Miki let's rock uh sales pretty much so last year we've been steadily putting like 20% growth last year what do it
(23:41) about about we build websites so Weise websites for Enterprise client so like Enterprise okay so we deal with digital media to start with but mostly marketing how big is Enterprise has to be on like th000 employees it's like has to be million pay view per day or higher that kind of it's a traffic so like it's like it has to be custom build everything's custom build there's a lot of innovation there like some banking companies marketing it's like super cool how'd you get it I mean well we don't have time for that but like very interesting okay so you've got this I yeah I totally want to hear
(24:18) the story but we well not so what's what do you want to do why like what what do we need to do to grow your company so last year new your clients I but within clients they add projects and expand that want more people there so like those we've been doing but also we have two big Wells so we have two big companies that are like 90% of our revenues so like we wanted to not do that cuz we had that experience I think year two one leaves and you're like yeah we we had that happen cuz like one of our client got merged by division or some some other companies and then they kind of decided not to use us but we
(24:55) quickly got another wh which was good but we've been kind of having try to what did you do when you had to quickly get another whale well we're very refal yeah we like we literally like s s s s Sal then like both of both of and then you're like okay now I've made enough money again so now I don't need to do sal sal sal sal yeah and also like we both of our own both owners are still very Hands-On so we do a lot of client work so if the C you say both owners you mean you and and the 50% own okay you said the owner of acquisition. comre um
(25:27) so co- Founders and then he and I we had a third partner but we have to buy him up and all those stories um after that so we when there's a client war that always takes president so like some of the things that we split it out so he's doing sales and um and financial and I take care of marketing and um HR and other operations are kind of shared including account management so when there's a client work that gets busy like one of us gets busy so one depart or whatever the operation kind of gets behind so that always happens it's been our struggle to then we try to hire some people but I didn't know too much about
(26:06) other departments so like this hiring didn't really work out I think I kind of mentioned that too you need division of roles between you and the co-founder and then you need to not step over each other's like territory and no one owns new businesses just why you don't have new business that's actually my question cuz because his client got really busy so he's on sales so I felt like sales I'm like I can help but normally we really separate it out cuz we figured it out that accountability actually work better if you split it out the divisions
(26:38) so it worked out good but last year for some well and by divisions you mean you have one client he has the other client so oh no no no not that so like ex sales is him so like I wasn't really touching the sales part and by sales you mean like internal sales like trying to upsell them and just get them to buy more [ __ ] from you no outbound sales actually outbound sales but you're not getting any customers from that so far got it yeah so outbound is not it's pretty D up so inbound like is that I don't know the the sales time to
(27:09) actually figure out inbound is like someone reaches out to you outbound you reach out to them first that's all yeah yeah so inbound has been fine but like outbound hasn't been so like we because we didn't want the two Wells we wanted to do more outbound sale but that hasn't been successful all last year and we're hearing that cuz he's a part of like a mastermind for agencies that last year was pretty bad but I think the it's kind of like a [ __ ] know excuse that there should be some way to figure out
(27:33) we can get new clients there is a way to get new clients I promise but I wanted to figure out like well so I don't think it's all his fault but like how can I convincingly put a measure that we can kind of like make sure this is done so like and it's also we're both owners and like we have a we both are very responsible but at the same time do we need to have some sort of measure that we always kind of make sure that hey we so have to be first I mean this is how Partnerships work yeah and so that's also why division of roles is important and so if you're like I will take over 100% of delivery if you go get
(28:10) us customers and then if you don't get us customers then one of us isn't necessary and so I'm just be like really real this is me just reading between the lines from what you're saying um honestly I just think like when you needed to go get a new client and get good a new whale you got a new whale fairly quickly it sounds like which means that if you need to go get business you know exactly what to do go get business you just aren't doing that right right and so the question is why and it means that one of you is
(28:41) satisfied with the lot of income and the amount of work that they have right now which I say is fine if you both agree on that but if one of you doesn't agree on that then you have conflict and so that conflict turns into direct conflict or it turns into when becoming resentful and so I'd prefer it if you just if you or the person whoever just say like we like the way that I'll explain something that might be helpful for everybody it really helped me out a lot so you guys know the difference between an insult and criticism help me a ton so an insult is an attack on someone's character right
(29:13) you suck you are an idiot whatever a criticism is you said this you did this these are not the same right it's a discrepancy between stated and reality it's all it do so you said you would hit this skull this is reality there's a difference so this is criticism and here's some things we can do to make that up and ideally next time you say this and that's what happened awesome right and so it's not a attack it's a statement of fact it's an observation of reality and so being able to explain that be like you are responsible for sales we have no
(29:51) sales this Gap is the problem that we have right now now if we did not want to grow this company and we both were align with that that then we would have no problem but I do want to grow this company you are not currently doing the activities that would grow this company so what do we do either you change what you do or I stop being here just being really real so you presented with a sales problem but I think you have a hard conversation with a co-founder to have being really honest we had the conversation so we
(30:22) actually having we did a new partnership you have a what sorry we we started a new partners ship you started a new partnership no no no the partnership with a like a hosting provider company so like they're actually bringing more Le to so we're we're development agency so like so like they're not like the competitors but we kind of went back to cuz we were used to work together so that actually bring in some outbounds so now we're getting that but his well yeah so I'll probably have like another conversation go back to like have the conversation and then I promise you if you really really have it and the thing
(30:55) is don't pull the punches if you're going to have the conversation be like this is what I want you're not doing that and that's my fault too because I probably haven't been clear about it but let me be clear now yeah like and if and if you don't want to do that fine let's figure out a way that we can just work on separate things CU I want to keep growing cool I think you do that the sales problem solve itself Alexander D very interesting business so tell me about it what's the problem why are we growing so it's a eom business so we
(31:26) sell clothing um and the clo is inspired by like Jack Ste so uh at the started I had a when I created the business I had a big vision for it like I wanted to be something more than just a clothing brand um so what I realized is like a lot of people who shot who shop with us would have similar interest so I wanted to create a community around that so I started uh you know creating a Discord Community now we have over 14,000 numbers and those people you know they're fan fans of the brand and uh they all share similar interest and they're actually one of our Lop
(31:59) converting customers like we people were through launch Mar products yeah yeah um and so you built a community and about stuff that they're all interested in sold them stuff related to that yeah exactly and so what we what I also wanted to do is I wanted to create because they're all enemy fans or Japanese culture I want to create something i r though as well so for example we created a nasca and we we started putting it on packaging like in the in their orders and they started learning more oh who is this character yeah and my goal was sort of like I want
(32:29) to like expand her and create a whole universe around her and then create eventually create like our own anime add as well okay right what's the problem uh the problem is I'm trying to figure out what I should put my resources to whether I should focus on scaling the clothing and maximizing that that's what's bringing in the revenue or focusing on this sort of like Universe building and creating our own characters to later on you know create value in other ways which will tie like FL day and maybe later on I was thinking like create an nft project around like the
(33:05) audience as because all have like similar interests right yeah so I just don't know like what want to focus on so one is like you have the economic engine in the business which is you sell clothing with a logo on it I'm just breaking I'm breaking thing down to like absolute Basics right so you need to keep doing that to be able to pay for the bills to do all the rest of the stuff now everything you describe with the universe is as far as I'm concerned in the micro is going to be basically media it's it's it's content basically around this character that allows you to charge a premium and attract more people
(33:37) to the brand right and so I don't think you need to do either or I just need you need to think about that as marketing spend and then you need to make sure that you you you cap it based on return on investment then provided your goal is to make money there I mean that I mean that super genuinely now the alternative of this is like I want to go build Disney and have a zillion characters but like it it it requires a ton of capital in order to do that and so in my opinion what you have been doing has been working really well and so I would take if you want to like reinvest Capital
(34:16) take the profit from there and reinvest more in that into building out more cool media for the character that you want uh to build and the lifestyle that you want to represent for your audience yeah he just I know that like down the line it's this going to be like you know what's going to create like generational wealth and I know that's what I want to do this original Ip yeah but right now like there's no return on investment for like I can't see it right just like I'm putting P money to it but it's going to pay off like well that's kind like a lot of times branding works that way like if
(34:50) I make content for three years and ask for nothing from people yeah my brain is going to be worth something and it is already and I'm like still really early to it so but I was able to do that because I had money I could not have done that if I I mean I could have done it I would just had to work a lot harder you know I could not have done other things Etc so you have an economic engine which will fund this thing the thing is is that like you will get a return because if you if if this works the way you want it to work it should grow so if you just pour money into it
(35:26) and more people don't find out about your stuff which doesn't then create more people buying then it's not working so I think I love the vibe because I looked at your sty like it's cool um so like I think more of that is a good thing and I think that'll just create more people who are raving fans in your audience but the thing that like I get the good thing is that you're a missionary not a mercenary like you want to make this thing real and it's awesome it's cool I want to make sure that it actually happens in the real world and not just in your head and so like there
(35:58) has to be money attached to it somewhere or you need somebody who really believes in it a ton and will take their money and just risk it for you it's either that either you're going to risk your own money or someone else is going to risk it but it's going to cost money and time to build this and so the nice thing is what you want to do is have a symbiotic relation between the character and the and the media that you're building and the way that you monetize and this is ultimately what you're going to want to do anyways because if the
(36:21) audience that you build that loves this character and stuff doesn't want to ever buy stuff from you then you're not buding the right behaviors anyways for it to achieve scale Mickey Mouse has to sell shirts hats t-shirts movies right so that's I would also study the hell out of Walt Disney yeah I I I looked into it okay yeah I would read everything that's ever been written on him um and look at like new age stuff look at what Gary's doing with um uh V friends he has a whole universe around the different characters same concept but there's Commerce there he's got
(36:51) cards he's got you know shirts he's got merch he's got all these other things um to build up the characters yeah I'm doing a lot of like Research into nft projects because like they're able to provide value through storytelling and like making value creating value out of nothing pretty much and to just I just never say those words again sorry I would just never say those words again value no value out of nothing no yeah um especially tied to nfts um but yeah does that make sense that's what I focus so to answer your question yes I would invest the cash that I have um as much as you believe because it's it's
(37:30) a it's a bet it's as much as you believe in this um but I would make sure that people are still being more attracted to your brand and buy more stuff yeah you bet how's it going rocking what's up J [Music] um I don't even know where to start it's we'll just ask one question I'll try and answer that one when you were in the process of pivoting with the model for gym launch and you were trying to just like get money together to even make it to the next thing that's exactly where I'm at Sweet fun like I have reread and watched and researched like everything
(38:15) you've ever done regarding that because it's just I I feel it balls because I mean what do you need to do right now I need to have people so that it is not solely me what does our by the way what do you sell uh it's a paid advertising agency for cannabis for cannabis okay got it okay tough yeah but that on the flip side of it being tough that's why there's there's so much leverage with that cool uh okay there's a ton so what's the issue what's the problem uh me well yeah sure it's always you but like what's the what's the
(38:58) business problem like is it not make is you're like I need to make all this money like are you not profitable are you it is profitable however it's just not well on long enough for the profit to just exist in a lump sum enough to be able to like pay for people because I've been I actually don't know what that means well I've been actively doing this for like four months okay so it's like I've brought money in okay but I've never had payroll never done any of that I've never hired anybody it's all those soft skills and just have it and working through the anxiety of getting through that first higher what's
(39:33) what's Revenue right now revenue is 600k okay okay got it um however okay that is the literal metric but I collect ad spend for them so actual profit would be like 90 900k a year okay yeah so okay so this will so so you got to sit in this room um and have some different different conversations I'm going to be super direct with you you don't need to worry about anything you just said yeah like you have 90k a year that you have to work with you have no room to hire people you either need to fix your model uh because if I'm
(40:15) guessing you're working all the hours of the day to make the 90k yeah right which means the model's broken so you can't hire more people because you basically you the most valuable employee in the business like the founder is always going to be the most to a person in business especially day one when there's no one else so you need to get to a point where like you should be able to make way more than what you need so that you have room to hire other people who can help you and so right now you don't have a people problem you have a model problem which means the way that you're
(40:44) charging or billing the Cannabis people you're either offering too much for them well it's really you're just like you're offering too much for too little fundamentally that's what it is cuz either you need to be working way less to be making the money you are and be like shoot I could take 10 times the customer I just need more customers or you should be charging way way more for where you're at and be like okay well I'm making 10 times more than I am right now and now I can go afford people that's it so either you need to do need to work on how you do delivery to make it 10 times more efficient or make it so
(41:15) that how much you make you make 10 times more per customer for what you're doing it's by about a factor of 10 like I think if you came here you're like we're doing about 900,000 a year and it's just me I'd be like okay okay cool let's draw orang on people that makes sense um h i i get it it just I I I didn't know that the question was oh you're fine dude no no no I'm no dude you're good you're good I'm trying to help you where you're at you get what I'm saying though forget about that do you get what I'm saying yes so you need either 10x the price
(41:45) that you're charging for what you're currently doing or make how you deliver what you're doing 10 times more efficient understood that's it otherwise the model was not going to work so trying to scale what you're currently doing is a bad idea you need to fix what you're currently doing so that you can scale it okay cool question me k m he does a lot of buy businesses okay I you anyways just a quick background so I own four auto body shops and then I pivoted into garage door there's a there's a Hailstone which I love and he got it I visited pivoted
(42:25) to garage stores because it's just um industry highly fragmented right now there's only maybe two big players that area I'm in is there not that many cool and so we started professionalizing the company I've been installing Sops checklist forms process yeah trainual it's really good um but my one issue is uh we have a weird Niche APPA moment which we're trying to diversify heavily away from where we kind of have a single Channel risk we pretty much give most of our leer home warranty companies there are eight of them so it's not like one you know jail but I
(42:58) don't like yeah I used to work like Geo and we would get a body shop and we'd become 30% 40 50 60 70% and we own them I don't want that I want just like I'm buy organic customers coming in paid leads you all these things and so where I'm at is I'm at this pivot point where I'm just about to start Mark you doing seven are you doing 7 million was it 7 million got 1.
(43:25) 5 million cash flow and um but it does have far money in the debt I purchase got it anyways the cool thing is is doing no marketing right now at all like we have one lead every month from marketing so we're about to start this whole SEO PPC maybe Facebook etc etc so my one question is you know I got to organize how it's going to happen how should I organize it should I get a marketing manager where should I get them from should I hire them kind of supervise build that up I teach me so if I can know because it it'll integrate with other parts of the business you know and it's just how do I would you organize it if you're at my state I basically get a build it from the ground up which is kind of cool yeah yeah I'm
(44:02) trying to think because it's kind of it's kind of the issue that Anon had with um like when it's a core function of the business like I see I see Rin making as a big part of the business like customer you have customer acquisition got delivery as the two you know and then you got Ops is the Third Leg of this stol like every business needs all ra someone to get customers someone deliver customers and someone to make sure that no one goes to jail right and like make sure all three have to like keep going around right and by that one I mean talks to people HR Finance
(44:26) legal all that stuff right um okay so it's a core function of the I mean like generating Le now I like the the fact that you have the eight the eight different places that you're getting the the warranty leads from so that's kind of sweet um I mean I would just continue to do that as much as I could get you know go from eight to you 20 or whatever um I don't even know how many you probably know the number saturated them there was one of them who said like oh you're biggest vender along with pal deep B my I'm a wh to them yeah
(44:56) right I would would probably if I'm trying to think about where I would start I me personally um PPC is is uh will be harder to crack initially but then once you have it it's very uh stable okay and so for local PBC I think will will work really well um it's a totally different monster but then social media ads like meta um specifically I think will work really really well the thing with meta ads for local is I'd want to have someone in house for that um the PBC guys there's a bunch of really good agencies for PPC
(45:30) that can do pretty good work for you on the local level um who can just probably handle it pretty well uh but the the social media side I have yet to see people who don't do huge companies do a good job and that's just because you have to have so much creative like creative gets tired in local market in like two to three weeks so you have to make creative every 21 days like and like a decent amount of it I mean this is why we had gym launch like we just we took all the creative burden over but we did it for a thousand locations so you'd
(46:01) have to build that in house so in terms of like ease and speed I would probably go vendor first for the PPC um this is me just saying what would I do yeah yeah I would probably go vendor first for PPC um and then I would and then I would probably I'd try and bring someone in house who understand probably a younger guy who understands um paid ads at a local level and the nice thing is that there's a gazillion of them guys who understand local ads on social media um and uh and give him some sort of exciting like little mini comp
(46:34) that he can turn into um and uh because if if he's relatively techsavvy and knows how to do social media ads and whatnot he could become a weapon for their business um and that could probably really help you on the acquisition side because you'll just like scoop them up put whatever 100 Grand 200 Grand in whatever you buy them for Lever the rest and then you could like immediately triple the business and roll it in just I'm kind of excited about the SEO portion I know that we're doing a Rebrand too so have the trucks wrapped a certain way by company and all
(47:04) that the SEO would you do that same kind of go through and agency out loud or a house see like HC but yeah I mean a PBC is really simple and so I think and they're usually pretty well priced especially for local and when you get a good guy it's like they just run the same Playbook they go for the same links they build the same way and they just kind of like it works um for seo seo is more complicated um and it is very much like the skill of the like there's I feel like there's more skill in my opinion for SEO than there is for PPC um but the nice thing is that local
(47:38) is easy to win um compared to like National and so since you're just trying to win local markets um again I just whenever I do anything in a new thing I start with vendors I if you gone through the agency chapter in the um leads book have it bought like just showed up on just literally read that chapter just read that chapter yeah it's um it just gives you my playbook for how I crack every new channel it's really what I do I buy buy the agency and then I I tell them I'm going to take over in six months you help me train the person and then eventually I won't need
(48:12) you yeah that's exactly why I bought the book and I came because I was like when I think of think yeah I think of marketing and sales and conversions have you had offers yet I'm not yet but I yeah missing out man going release yeah yeah you could you could literally both in like there's one's three hours the other's like four and a half so you should be good all right Adam TNT so uh pay ads agency um Google or meta both okay totally different monsters yeah but um I like 12 years in experience Google and I saw how important that it was too so I just learned that you I those yeah um my
(48:53) biggest issues are sqls that within mind zone right and then who do you sell to primarily company spending over 100k and that's per month or per year per per month okay per month got it okay um and then on top of that like what you just talked about what other people talk about is one replace agencies and H house okay which Cur LC be short unless you plan for it so if I plann no I said unless you plan for it yeah yeah and just bake it into how you do things so those are my two problems okay so the I
(49:31) mean the the them trying to bring it in house I would bring it up front and um I would have you read that chapter in the book okay good so so I would say like cool so what I'm going to do is this is the first part and then whenever you want to start bringing this in-house we'll switch from this to Consulting and we'll men M the transition period and we'll stay on a Consulting basis until you your team is outperforming what we were doing now if the team never outperforms what you do then you stay on a Consulting basis forever but it's still the nature of the relationship is
(50:02) fun because like being a service provider versus being consultant totally different vibe which I'm sure you've done before um and so it actually goes from like subservient to you being a teacher which is actually kind of fun and so that'll extend LTV it aligns your interest blah blah blah so that's good uh What was the other problem so for the how do you price living fare to that done for you um what's your uh current done for your pricing typically 10% immediate right um it's a good question I mean honestly I just uh I'd
(50:47) probably end up just saying like I'll either add in the Consulting you know what I mean I'll either add it in to what we're currently doing because they're going to need the they're going to need the the service from you while they're getting the Consulting mhm and then basically so the question is after the Consulting sorry after the delivery period's over what's the consulting fee for after the fact yeah that one I mean I'd probably look at something like I don't know 30% just as a starting point 30% of what you were doing so probably like 3% of AD
(51:21) spend mhm and so then you can just be like listen the question is can I get your guy to be you know this much more efficient if you think the arguments there great if not no worries so probably 20 30% is probably where I'd be okay and then the second part is SQL for my genius which is over the 100K um I just see any account take over that's over 100k I CR in few weeks under 10 a lot harder um so I want more SQL that way right now my entire python is through Affiliates okay and just referral partners and cupworth yeah you need you
(51:59) just need to go get what you want so it's got to be outbound so either got to go outbound in terms of like high value targets uh so like cold call cold DM whatever um one two you can make content very niched in terms of what you're talking about um that'll still get everyone but you'll also get the good people um or you just use your own expertise of running ads and Target those people so if I had to do these in order I would probably start with ads cuz that's your bread and butter and I would just start a campaign that's specifically for those people and calls
(52:29) them out in every single way you can like targets that way but then the messaging has to be just super harsh like if you're not if you're not spending 100 Grand a month please just scroll past this ad like don't mess my pixel up and probably LinkedIn yeah I think LinkedIn has a lot of really good quality people yeah Muhammad yes all right well thanks for this opportunity you bet um little bit background about me I'm a dentist uh own my practice for 15 years and I focus on dental implants and um the primary uh patient inflow method has been Google ads for the past eight years
(53:13) uh I'd say about half of my patients come from internal referrals from friends and family and then the other half come from Google ads that company that I've been with for eight years has had the same landing page for eight years and has not gotten any feedback from us about lead quality or anything and past year I would say don't you wish you had him as a customer like I love this right that's easy quality's gone down you know it's just all kind of [ __ ] so last year I decided you know this is a really important part of my business I want to just take ownership of this so I
(53:48) partnered up with these people who I was introduced to say Hey you cracked the Google ads algorithm I'm gonna uh work on the the coaching and Lead nurturing and value building aspect of it so we and that didn't work out this company didn't know what they were doing so it all went to [ __ ] so anyways now I'm working with another company trying to build um The Funnel the landing page and what not have not made any content but I have all the set up to start doing that uh so I wanted to um build content
(54:21) specifically for the funnel so when people click on the ad they have a video being you know social proof all that kind of stuff but I also want to build uh or create content uh just for General like social presence and and also value building um so should I focus primarily on the Google ads first and lean on that and then start working on the general content right second question I have for you is I've been doing what you have said that everyone does which is survey the market for what the price is charge a little bit less offer ton more value
(54:58) so the ton more value that I'm offering is a lot of additional procedures that go along with the service that I'm providing that help create predictability in long term and I want to lean in on that as a differentiating factor because a lot of the competition is newer newer chains newer doctors they don't have the track history and I have a lot of patients that I've treated 10 12 15 years ago that I want to sort of highlight and so in that regard should I continue charging or advertising the price that I am advertising and just highlight the more value that I'm
(55:32) getting to get more more Revenue coming in first and then try to raise my price or you know love feedback on how to position myself in this new funnel this new my favorite way of doing it would be just raise your price okay I mean i' I've told my father this for the entirety of my life and he has still never listened to me so you know maybe maybe it'll work for you he's like I booked out for N9 years and I'm like yeah what if you just doubled your price you could work the same amount you currently do every day and just make twice as much money uh and so unless you have a demand issue or a convers like do
(56:07) you have a conversion issue right now like when you get people in do they not buy um so I don't really have a sales process a sales system it's all just me well you do have a sales process you just haven't documented it right but I just you know I just talk to them and let them know hey this is what your situation is this is how I would handle I'll bet you if I recorded you and I played 50 of those side by side second by second you'd be like oh this is the part where I make the same amount of jokes about this thing and then I ask them why they're here and then I say what have you thought about before why
(56:36) now why why ises this to help you out okay got it okay has there been anything else no want me to tell you about this thing I think you might be a good fit here's what you can expect great do you have any questions for me blah blah blah and so you probably do have a process you just don't write it down now after you know reading your books and listening everything now we're we're working on creating a system and then educating the team on it so they can carry the Baton so um that's where I am and uh you know um raising the price I certainly can justify it just because
(57:09) like I said I have you also do it even if you couldn't justify it just raise it anyways because you felt like it because it's Tuesday because who cares you raise it because you want to it's America and you can chose charge what you want and they can choose to say no and you can choose to say this is all what I'll what I pay for what I uh what I charge and so like it's like just in terms of the idea of like I have to do this because to do this it's like you can just do it like we just bought a company a year ago and I mean I tell the story because I like breaking the belief and so we
(57:40) bought it we did this massive analysis and I was just like I the whole leadership team and they're like so what's the big how are we going to like grow the hell out of this company I was like I think I'm just going to double the price and they were like what else are we gonna do I was like I think that's it I think that's all I'm going to do and they're like but what about all these other I was like I don't think that's I think we're just going to do that and so we did that and the sales team was like so would we need to retrain the sales team I was like no no I was like you're going to say the same thing and then the very end when you say
(58:10) the price I was like instead of saying this number say this number that's it and then we did that and um it took me nine calls with the founder nine uh and he didn't agree and so we settled on 50% increase so he increased the price by 50% and close rates went up oh [ __ ] because they were mispriced and so we sold a higher percentage of people add 50% more money and if you do more times more it's way more because all that goes to the bottom line and so uh that's the beautiful thing with price increases is that it's all profit one of my favorite ways to make more Profit just charge more so um
(58:49) tldr yes I think you you charge more and in terms of uh the ad stuff uh you're either going to have to learn this which feels unlikely or you're going to have to keep doing this trial and everything well I am uh learning it myself I actually have uh started the courses and gotten into Google ads and Facebook ads it's again it's not something I'm going to do myself but I can't delegate until I have full in-depth knowledge which is kind of how I built the rest of the business I like it we have uh the lab
(59:17) site also on site so it's vertically integrated we just need to just crank that engine of of once you get that going the ultimate version of the businesses that you start buying other practices right because then you can install your systems on top your reputation Etc and like that's when this gets a lot more interesting

The 4 Ways Fortunes Are Made (and how I stumbled into one) - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZfaZYFx89UU

Transcript:
(00:00) when i was 27 years old i just sold all of my gyms and put all of my money into a new venture and lost all of it and so i had a thousand and thirty six dollars when i was 27 years old two years later i had over 17 million dollars in my bank account it was because i accidentally stumbled into one of the four ways that fortunes are made all right it's one of the key things that we have to understand and we're trying to break down today is one the difference between money and wealth two the four types of leverage
(00:25) that exist and then within those types of leverage permission and permissionless leverage and how you can harness those things in your business so that you can make them into things that can build fortunes so the first thing is understanding what is money right money is simply the way that we transfer wealth from one person to another all right that's all it is it just functions as a medium of transfer it's actually not in it of itself valuable it's valuable in so far as it allows us to acquire assets which gets us to the second
(00:51) column which is wealth this is what you want and that's why there's a difference between rich people and wealthy people wealth is about assets that earn while you sleep meaning that you don't have to trade any time to have these assets make you money and so one of the things that i think i got from taylor walsh was um poor people do the wrong things rich people do the right things wealthy people own the right things and so as you're transitioning through life you have to think about am i am i someone who's doing the right thing
(01:19) or am i somebody trying to own the right things and so uh for example lawyers doctors accountants they can never really make crazy money they can't they cannot get wealthy super wealthy unless they transition from being a practitioner or they're training time for dollars into owning an entire practice of lots of doctors working for them which means they then they have created an asset which then generates wealth while they sleep right it generates money while they sleep which is what makes it into wealth all right and so if you look over the
(01:46) last hundreds of years we're talking 500 000 plus years fortunes have been made in four ways in the beginning so this is then the first way was through labor all right and the reason labor is the first way of gaining leverage is because there was no other way of getting it that's why the kings and queens had hundreds and hundreds of servants that's how the pyramids were built right that's how rockefeller was able to build his oil across the united states right was through labor right and so because of that he didn't have to
(02:13) trade his own time for dollars he was able to buy other people's time right now labor is the hardest type of leverage to employ it'll impress your parents but it won't actually it's one of the hardest things to employ anybody who knows who has 50 100 500 plus employees understands that it's one of the hardest things to employ but it is one of the things one of the four ways of gaining leverage and one of the key tenets of these first two is that these are permission based leverage you need other people's permission you need to
(02:39) you need to appease others in order to use this type of leverage the second type of leverage which is also still permission based is capital all right that's money specifically other people's money and so just an example of what capital is is let's say i want to buy something um that doubles in value uh over five years all right and let's say i get somebody to give me a hundred percent of the money to buy this thing right and so after five years i have to repay the person back but that thing doubled in value right so
(03:10) let's say it was a hundred dollars when i bought it from someone else's money and then it's 200 after five years well i have to pay back the hundred dollars plus some interest but then everything else i get to keep and so that is a type of capital where if you think about how much my returns were they were basically infinite because i didn't put any money down right and that is why capital has been the second main way that fortunes were built this is where the the newer billionaires newer they're still old now
(03:36) billionaires were created this is the buffets this is the monger this is the carl icons of the world who made their wealth through financing and using other people's money as leverage both of these things you have to ask for permission people have to give you the money they have to you have to take that money under terms under which you're going to give it back right now the new way of creating wealth there are two of them and they are permission permissionless all right so here you don't need any permission in order
(04:03) to use these things and that is what the new fortunes are being made of the first is through code all right so this is all the big software companies that you see the tech giants that exist they use code for permissionless leverage because with code it costs zero dollars to have an additional person consume or get utility from what the code does right and so if you have a piece of software that's a crm adding a hundred users or adding a thousand users costs you no additional amount for that one more user all right and so that is why code is one
(04:38) of the things that's created fortunes in the present day now if you're like well alex i don't know how to write code well then let me tell you the fourth way which is the one that i accidentally stumbled in when i switched my business from a service-based business which was just selling other people's time to a media business which was number four which is media now if you think about the tycoons that exist out there zuckerberg he's media he sells eyeballs he sells impressions google sells impressions they sell media right
(05:07) bloomberg he used old school media so he was the news he was radio all that kind of stuff all of that was in his network and the beautiful thing about that is that when you have media you have a captured amount of eyeballs you can continually sell those eyeballs and as they grow you just continue to sell them and it costs no incremental amount and so the gross margin in this are basically 100 percent there's no added cost and so you've heard me talk about having good margins in a business these are the ways that you get the exceptional world class
(05:33) margins which is what builds fortunes right and so for me when i transitioned my company from doing a done-for-you service where i used to fly out as a sales team and fill up locations of brick and mortar facilities to licensing media i was able to sell at zero incremental cost because of that my margins went through the roof and that was what enabled me to acquire money which i was then able to transfer into wealth all right now if you're thinking right now like well there's some places like you know is google code or media the answer is
(06:00) yes it's both and so if you can employ multiple types of leverage then you juice the returns even more and so that's why all the super wealth that is being created a lot of times it's using two or three of these types of things they're taking other people's money to get other people's labor to write the code that then they sell as media once they acquire all of the eyeballs and that's the winner takes all games that are existing right now but right now if you're like well i don't know how to write code well that's
(06:24) okay i don't either and so that's where we take things like this youtube channel this is why joe joe rogan can sell his podcast for 100 million dollars you can sell ad space because he owns media and so right now this is where you can create blogs for no money you can create youtube videos for no money you can anything you can make you can make podcasts for no money all of these things you can do as media to distribute at zero incremental cost and that is how fortunes are built and over time as you can see it gets i want to say easier to build
(06:55) fortunes which is why now is the best time to be alive out of any time can you imagine a time where you there weren't just fun you couldn't just raise capital you couldn't just have accredited investors that you could call up these things didn't exist it was just the time of labor it was the time of pyramids right but as time has progressed the ways to build fortunes have increased and the level of permission that's required has decreased right if you are the best coder in the world you can build something that no one else can
(07:19) build if you are the absolute best at providing value at capturing attention then you can do this and you can create your fortune with no one's permission and that's the beauty of being alive today and so if you're looking about your own business and you're thinking about how how can i make my business more valuable try and tap into one of these four types of leverage because if you do that i can guarantee you will make more money and you'll have a chance at building one of these super fortunes and i was very fortunate to have
(07:42) stumbled into this fourth one and now i look for it deliberately so hope you found that valuable are as valuable as as it was for me when i started thinking about this stuff and i'll see in the next video

6 Ways Small Businesses Beat Big(ger) Competitors... - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) every week layla and i my wife talked to five to ten new companies to potentially invest in that have already passed a couple rounds of screening and i was on a conversation the other day with a coaching business and the founder made a very ridiculous statement and i thought i would make a video about it because i think you'll get a lot of value from it they made the statement i just don't think there's a way that we can make our customers more valuable uh which as you can imagine if you've been following my
(00:24) channel for a while you know drove me into a fit of rage not really but i i stopped and i wish i had recorded it but the basic premise is that that's just patently false and i'll show you six different ways you can increase lifetime value in a coaching or service based business all right and so if you don't know who i am my name is alex mosey i own acquisition.
(00:43) com it's a portfolio of companies that right now does about 110 million dollars a year and continuing to grow and so i just make these videos because i hope you get value from them okay so there are there are two ways that you grow a business right number one is you get more customers the second is you make them worth more that's it that's chunked all the way up at the top of this right like either get more customers you make them worth more all right there's lots of sub buckets underneath of that but those are the two fundamentals if you're attacking a
(01:07) business in terms of like trying to figure out how you want to grow your own business you can use these mental frameworks and so these are kind of like my own checklist of what i'm thinking through or someone's talking because we only have 15 to 20 minutes with these new companies because we talk to a lot of them just to get a feel if we want to invest time and money into them so that being said with this particular company it was a coaching business now the nice thing is that with coaching businesses it really applies to all types of
(01:29) businesses so if you're a service-based business if you coach for weight loss that is a service business if you you know a lot of businesses just don't like the term coaching but it is more or less what you're doing you're advising clients on some sort of outcome right and so in this particular business they said that they didn't have a way of you know making the customer more valuable and so these are the six ways that you can make a customer more valuable and i'll give the example that i shared with them to try to drive it home all right
(01:52) so if you can think about this within your own business you will make more money so the first and obvious one is you can raise prices so you can sell the exact same thing and add money to it and make more money sounds wild but that is something that a lot of people don't do and so getting the pricing right is a way of making more money there are sub pieces that we could sell higher percentages of people by having different pricing levels but just big picture number one is you can increase the price number two is that you can
(02:15) lower the cost of goods right because we're looking at how can we make a customer more valuable we can make that by raising the price but you can also lower how much it costs to fulfill on them and so there's two easy ways you can do this within a coaching business one is that you could decrease the cost of the people themselves so you keep the ratio that you have with your clients but then you probably outsource a component of that uh you know to somebody who might be abroad who'd be willing to work for less money all right
(02:38) that would be a way of decreasing the cost of goods the other way of decreasing the cost of goods is keeping the same number of coaches but increasing the ratio between coaches to clients if one coach is managing 10 clients and then they go to managing 20 clients your cost of goods cuts in half right and in so doing that your margin goes up hopefully you're tracking with me so number one increase the price number two decrease the cost of goods number three is increase the purchase velocity or frequencies the number of
(03:01) times people buy all right and so within the context of a recurring revenue business that would be decreasing churn though getting people to stick and stay and pay longer right so if somebody normally buys and then stays for three months in your you know service-based business or coaching business or whatever it is then if we can get them to stay just an additional month it's a 25 increase in ltv so how much that person is worth to us over the lifetime of them being with us right and so number one price two cost of goods
(03:25) number three getting them to buy more times the other whole next three buckets all kind of fall they're different flavors of the same thing all right and so it's cross sells upsells and down cells and so i'll give you examples of each of those so cross sales is when you have them buy something and then buy a different thing as in a as an add-on all right so if you have a level of service uh let's say you have a coaching business right because i'm using the example that we were talking about if they if they have a core service but
(03:52) there's an element of something that uh someone needs to do so let's say they're they're doing some sort of business coaching right a lot of times they're gonna have some sort of model that they're helping people execute within their business or flip to and then there's sub-components of the execution so there might be creating ads that would be an add-on service that you could add it could be drilling their their sales team right so helping them train their sales or train themselves on sales because they need
(04:16) that additional level of support and so just think about the different bottlenecks that people are experiencing within the execution of the core business that not necessarily everyone will use but some people would get a tremendous amount of value from those are kind of perfect scenarios for add-ons that you can add to the service levels that will increase the lifetime value because let's say twenty percent of people take uh an upsell you know of an extra thousand dollars a month and they're paying a thousand dollars a
(04:38) month well just like that you took your average monthly from a thousand to twelve hundred right so it's a twenty percent increase because you got twenty percent of people to take an additional uh level of service all right the second type of sell here so i said there's six ways so we've covered four price cost of goods increasing purchase frequency cross sells the next one is upsells all right so i like to delineate this from cross sales cross sales is selling a different thing to the same customer all right so in the mcdonald's version this
(05:05) is like would you like fries with your coke right or whatever it is fries with your burger doesn't matter but like it's the crossover selling something different that still goes with the core thing an upsell is where you sell more of the thing that they just bought so this is where in i'll use the mcdonald's example to drive it home and then i'll give you a coaching example so in the mcdonald's example it's would you like you want a burger do you want a bigger burger right that would be an upsell right it's the same but more of the same
(05:29) thing and it's good to think through these these frameworks because this is how you can think of and iterate your own service levels within the business so let's say that somebody in this coaching business you know meets with their coach every whatever every every two weeks we could increase that frequency and say okay well like our higher level of service you can meet with the coach more times right or you could have it's more access whatever the thing that we're selling is it's just more of it and you'd be surprised a lot
(05:57) of people just want more and this is where this gets kind of interesting from uh from a from a pricing and lifetime value perspective customers are fractal and what that means is that it's 80 20. so one out of five customers is typically willing to pay twice as much as the core offer that continues to go up so if you know if you have 100 people 20 of them are willing to pay five times you know as much as the the base adr which then means that if you get 20 to take something that's five times as expensive then you actually just double
(06:25) the lifetime value now if you look at that 20 and look again and do another 80 20 split on that then four of those 20 are gonna be willing to pay another five times more than the remaining 16 in that group right 80 20. and so it continues to get fractal so it's like 80 20 95.5 99.1 all of those are fractal distributions and with each of those increments you usually have people who have significantly higher spending power and so simply offering a significantly more expensive version to 20 of the customers is simply a really good way of
(06:57) increasing ltv all right and so in this coaching example if they had a large group component and they wanted to do a semi-private component or small group then that would be something that should reasonably be you know probably four or five times as expensive um given the fact that it's now significantly more narrow and more attention is given to each customer all right so increase the price increase uh decrease the cost of goods get people to buy more times sell them more stuff that's different sell them more of the same all right cross
(07:24) sales upsells and the last one number six is downsells all right so this is when and in the purpose of the down cell there's kind of two two key areas in the business where this is helpful number one is on the front end number two is on the back end all right so on the front end getting more down cells it's i'll tell you where it backfires but if you have another offering uh for people who get on the phone it's especially useful and this is how you do it right for disqualified or under qualified leads all right because you've already paid
(07:51) for the marketing to get this person on the phone or into your kind of conversion event but if the person does not qualify for your core offer because they don't meet certain you know requirements that you've already predefined of like what a perfect customer is for you then you want to have something for them that can help them ascend into that that's going to be significantly lower touch or ideally no touch at all right and so in this instance i think this was a health coaching thing they i was like just create a done for you at home or done uh
(08:19) do it yourself at home program that people who can't afford to have the level of service they get a little bit of a head start they get a little bit of education to get them going so that they can then you know if they succeed with that they show themselves they're motivated they show themselves this is more valuable than then they can ascend up where it gets sticky is where you have people who otherwise would have bought the core offer but then the sales team starts down selling them that's the no no that's what you don't want to have
(08:41) happen and that's why tracking before you make it like implement a downsell into your sales process is important because you can see the percentage of people who are buying the core offer and so we should just simply be adding on more sales without detracting from the amount of people who are buying the core offer the second way that we protect against this is that when you have the customer requirements if someone meets the customer requirements for your core offer they should never be presented the downsell that is in my opinion that's
(09:04) how i prefer to do it because it also keeps it black and white for the sales team so because you don't want to have gray in making sales decisions in my opinion i think it's much easier to say like if they are this sell this if they are not this sell this that way we're just treating the customer for what was best for them rather than trying to like go based on their budget this is me personally because i just want to say like if i'm going to make this promise to you i'm going to fulfill this promise to you period and if we need to find a
(09:27) way for you to get the resources to do it then we will help you do that but like we're not going to just give you a deluded version of what we had right and so it's only like if you do not qualify then and only then will we down sell the reason this is effective is that you have these people you've already paid to get on the phone and so if you can liquidate a certain percentage of that cost by having a down sell it will help you offset cost of acquisition and ultimately make some more money and you also get more customers because those
(09:51) people have potential to extend in the future which is a great thing now the other place where down cells help is actually on the back end so information declines in value over time right and a lot of businesses that we work with are e-learning service coaching et cetera types of businesses and so one of the difficulties is how do they uh attack churn and so part of the way of attacking churn is realizing how people are consuming value through the services that they offer right and so if someone you know the day before you learn
(10:17) something very important it's incredibly valuable the day after it you don't need to learn it again because you already have it so the value declines very very precipitously um in these types of businesses which is what we've spent you know our life kind of fixing and making them more valuable right but having a down salt component on the back end when people are like you know what i've gotten a lot from this you know i don't i don't need the training and all that kind of stuff anymore what it is the question is what do they need or what
(10:40) would they like to keep right a lot of times community access is something that people will continue to pay for even though they're not access to the information anymore because like they don't need it because they already they've already figured it out right um or certain levels of troubleshooting and support whether it be technical support or accountability level support those are things that are are consumable right in terms of like you might need to be held accountable last month and you need to be held accountable this month um
(11:02) towards doing the actions and so when we think about this and we're looking at a business and this was the the coaching business that i give you as an example hopefully those answers uh give you some light depending on what type of business you have but there are always ma ways to make a customer more more valuable over time and so those are the six um that i think through when i'm looking at any kind of coaching info service type business that we're looking to take on which is like where do we see opportunity that we can increase the ltv
(11:28) per customer so that we can then turn around and spend to get more customers on the front end right because we're chunking back up two ways to get more make more money get more customers make them worth more and that is a wrap so uh thank you guys appreciate if you're new to mozy nation welcome i appreciate you and i'll see you guys in the next video bye

(00:28) up and it's most of most platforms are based on an auction which means that it's just multiple businesses competing for the same eyeballs and so the people who are better able to convert those eyeballs are going to be the ones who are going to be able to out compete and win obviously the model the price points all the other stuff matters but the conversion rate in it of itself matters a lot too now there's a lot of parts in a pipeline that exists from acquisition but what i want to do is just give you one thing uh from today's video that you
(00:51) can immediately implement and it's simple that has worked and made us a lot of money all right the process is simple every week what we do is we have our marketing meeting and we do one split test just one all right and that's because everyone wants to test 100 things but what it does is it forces us to be very very focused on the one thing that we think is going to drive the highest result for us and the thing is is that when you do this every single week for 52 weeks in a row and you do that for five years your process just gets better and better
(01:23) and better and those increase those increases in conversion compound all right and so when we are running split tests on marketing especially for paid advertising um i'll give you the two biggest things that we look at all right the first thing it sounds obvious and simple but people don't do it is we simply split test the headlines on our landing pages that's it we simply split test the headlines the next thing that we'll split test is going to be the image that is underneath of the headline all right because what we've seen from the vast
(01:56) majority of all of the tests that we've done is that almost all of the juice that's going to come the biggest jumps in conversion rate happen above the fold and so when i say above the fold it means like when you go on your desktop and you go to a landing page everything that you can see before scrolling is above the fold when you go to your your phone um and you blend and you you load a page everything you see that's immediately available on the screen is above the fold and so that is where that is where you're selling them on
(02:24) whether they're going to stay on the page and continue to read more and that's where the biggest returns will come from all right and so we will split test almost every week the the majority of our of our tests will be i would say 90 of our tests are either headline or image tests and that's it that's literally it um sometimes you know we'll actually because if if we're changing a headline then the image doesn't make sense we'll do you know a new headline and image against it against the old headline image and image but that will be the
(02:52) entirety of the test and so if you can implement this one process into your marketing cadence so when you meet with your marketing team or if you're hopefully you know if you're just doing the marketing for yourself if you set this cadence on your own calendar of every monday we meet and we say what was last week's test what was the winner great did we beat the control if we didn't beat the control then we try another test right and the thing is is when you do this on a continuous basis the business will continually improve
(03:18) and so there's a million things you can do but what are the few things that you should do that are going to drive the biggest result because ultimately all of us have the same amount of time every day and so it's the people who make the best decisions who focus on the fewest variables that make the biggest difference right one of the biggest things that drives me nuts is when someone says you know oh i said we should do that ages ago right which is one of the things by the way for my team if anyone's listening please don't do that it drives me nuts
(03:43) there's a million things that we should do right we should probably be better about our follow-up we should probably be doing more email marketing we should probably be making more content well obviously but what of all of the things that we can do given the resources time effort and human capital that we have and money are going to drive the biggest result and so when i think about all the different things that we can improve on our marketing standpoint just doing this one thing will consistently yield better returns in terms of time and
(04:09) effort and and the amount of time it takes to do this and the amount of return we get from it is disproportionate and i see even a lot of experienced you know marketers and business owners uh who don't do this you know what i mean and i'm like that's crazy you know why why would you not do that and so a simple process you can outline focus on everything above the fold usually headline sub-headline image those are the things that are going to be the things that drive the biggest conversion rate optimization and you know use this in the business
(04:35) see the results for yourself and keep being awesome and i'll catch you guys on flip side bye

(00:00) boop one decision five million dollars a year i lost as a result of this i want to tell you about one of the scariest decisions i've ever made my entire life which was when i had my gyms i was selling a boot camp at the time this is before i knew a lot about pricing and i was charging 99 a month and i uh got really fed up at one point and i was like i don't think i'm helping people i want to have semi-private because this is where people are really going to transform their bodies and i want to sell with conviction right so
(00:29) just keynote sidenote pro tip life hack if you can sell something that you truly believe in you'll make a lot more money and so i had gotten to the point where i didn't really believe in boot camp as a vehicle for for personal transformation in terms of body wise and so i was so convicted about our summer private program because clients were getting way better results there that i wanted to switch all my clients over that now i couldn't do that at 99 a month and so i sent a mass letter out to my customers that said we were going to
(00:54) go from 99 a month to 299 per month so i was going to triple my prices add more value but i was going to triple my prices all right and at the end of this video i'll tell you what happened when i sent that email out now what i want to do is tell you a secondary story of a similar situation that happened later on in my business career all right and it was we were we were selling our uh program at 42 000 per year all right um at the time and that was being billed at 800 bucks a week roughly all right and i uh wanted to decrease our churn
(01:30) and so i've been i was trying to figure out a way to decrease our turn so we could extend you know increase our lifetime value per customer and i kept you know all my my team and all that stuff they're like we have to lower our price we have to lower our price and i hate i hate lowering prices i don't like lowering prices it just generally doesn't mean you make more money after a long time i said you know what fine we're going to add more and we're going to go to 600 per week all right that's what we're gonna do all
(01:54) right which if you're doing the math it's like 31k that's what i decided to do let me tell you what happened in each of these scenarios as soon as i made this change right here all right so what i did was i did this big announcement i said we're going to roll out this new additional services program and i did this huge presentation in this huge pitch i stacked it and stacked it and stacked it and i was like and you're going to get all this stuff and you're all going to get a discount and that's what i said and everyone was
(02:21) like yay i actually did have one person complain to me um they said why are you doing this now you should have been discounting us before which just goes to show you that no one will ever be happy with what you're doing i was literally saying that they can pay less and i got somebody upset with me and so anyways i decreased the price and so this is what ended up happening my churn remained completely unchanged and i lost five million dollars per year in profit boop one decision five million dollars a year i lost as a
(02:53) result of this and so i can tell you firsthand most times when you lower your prices you make a lot less money and so what happened to me is that my overhead stayed the same it actually went up a little bit so i added about 100k a month in in overhead to my business so that i could add for this this new service all right and then i decreased my price by 25 so imagine cutting top line by 25 which is literally what i did and by making this little beautiful combination so i increased my cost by 1 million dollars and i decreased my my
(03:24) top line by 400 000 per month at the time for that business it sucked because here's the beautiful thing i thought hey if i decrease this price if i can cut our churn by half right which is what i thought i was going to be able to do if i could cut my churn in half let's say from 10 to 5 i would still 2x ltv so i'd rather decrease by 25 percent but then 2xl tv i'll take that trade every time right aha but that's not what happened turns stayed the same and i just lost 25 of top line which if we were running a 50 margin business
(03:59) right i just lost half my profit which we weren't we were actually running a 70 margin business at the time right and so i actually cut my income by a third which sucked for that business it was not fun i highly recommend not doing it and so that was the first thing that happened so let me tell you the story that i started with this puppy all right where i had my clients and i told them all hey this is what we're gonna do i'm gonna give you two weeks for free so i did have to front this labor two weeks free of this
(04:27) new service it's much better you're gonna get way more personalized attention you're gonna be lifting weights you're gonna learn form all this type of stuff and i said after those two weeks you're gonna automatically all be enrolled at 299 per month let me know if this is going to materially affect your life and you won't be able to buy groceries as a result of this decision so here's what happened one third of my customers left they said alex you suck i can't believe you're raising prices on us blah blah blah two-thirds of them stayed
(04:57) at three times the price what happened i 2xed the revenue of my business and i serviced only two-thirds of my customers which means my cost of fulfillment went down and my revenue went up excellent combination and so by doing that one thing i was able to more than 2x the profit of my business and so i tell both of these cautionary tales as i was petrified to make both of these decisions one of them dramatically increased the profit of my business the other one dramatically decreased the profit of my business in most cases
(05:35) providing more value and charging a higher price in order to provide the higher value will make you more money because you will service fewer people at higher prices the reverse of trying to service more people at lower prices by also providing more things most times will make you less money especially in a service-based business and so i tell this cautionary tale because it makes me sick to think about it but hopefully it uh it makes you sick to think about it and if you're contemplating what should i do with my prices because i
(06:07) would like to increase my ltv the ltv can be increased in six ways all right number one you increase your price number two you decrease your costs and then number three four five six are resales get people to buy more times upsells get them to buy more of the stuff they're currently buying cross sells get them to buy different things down sells get people who are not going to buy to buy something all right so this is you're buying burgers once a week now i want you to buy burgers twice a week this is you go from a small burger to a
(06:44) big burger this is would you like fries with your burger this is would you like a junior burger instead of your current burger so that you buy more or buy something instead of buying nothing so these are the six ways that you increase ltv you'll notice what i was trying to do was get more people to do this and i cut this and i lost and so i tell this story to hopefully get more people to not make the terrible mistake that i did and i have learned that painstakingly and most times i would say 99 times out of 100
(07:22) when you lower the price you make less money sometimes you make more but the vast majority of time you make less so and i'll tell you one final thing to illustrate this concept that i think everyone should understand so let's say you've got a 100 thing here and let's say your profit is 40 bucks if you decrease your price to 80 bucks right on this product you would have to sell two times as many people at this lower price because you have half the profit right say this is cost most times if you make this kind of change you're not going to
(07:55) two extra sales but you will make half the money so make sure that when you're making these changes and here's the flip side if you were to take this and go to 150 right now you're making let's say we're now making ninety dollars so we more than 2x our profit you probably won't sell half as many customers you might just sell three quarters as many customers and make two times the money which means more than what you're making now small tweaks big changes lots of impact think through these decisions my name is alex mozy own acquisition.com we have a
(08:33) portfolio company of 85 million dollars in revenue yearly my goal is that for everybody in this channel there's a lot of people who are broke and i don't want you to be one of them if you enjoyed this you found value in this in your own business hit the subscribe button so we can give you more vids like this and if you did not i love you either way keep being awesome and i'll catch you guys next vid bye

(00:00) what's going on everyone happy whatever day it is that you are watching this um i get messages all the time all the time um and comments about what are your favorite books and maybe in another video or podcast i will do uh do an exploratory you know what i mean of the the books that have been most influential but if i'm being honest uh i didn't really start reading a ton until after i had made a lot a lot of you know a relatively high amount of money right and uh and i started reading when i had more time right so
(00:31) so it would be kind of backwards for me to say hey these are the things that created my success when in reality i feel like i started reading when i had the time and be like ah this is really interesting and so um i think that to to kind of make this story full circle before i even started my first business i was definitely a seeker uh which is like you're just looking for something you're searching for something that's because you just realize that something's wrong with your life right and that's kind of how i felt when i had
(00:57) my my consulting job which is what i took after college and during that time period i read all the time and i remember realizing after six or 12 months of just reading book after book after book of self-help and you know personal development and like all that kind of stuff that my life was literally the same and i remember this was like kind of like a jarring moment for me because i just sat there i finished a book and then i thought to myself and it was like the happiness advantage or some you know whatever right
(01:24) and i was like uh my life is not any different than it was before i started reading these books and so i thought about it for a while and i also realized that half the books contradicted each other and i was like man this is really difficult and so what i ended up my conclusion was i wouldn't read a book unless i executed everything in the book and so what ended up happening next was i became very very selective about what books i would read because i would i wouldn't get another book until i have felt like i had executed that
(01:54) and so the result of that was instead of reading lots of books i started reading a handful of books a lot of times and so that was um really transformational for me i think the first book that i read a lot of times was how to make friends and influence people and i still think to this day if you just did nothing else in business but just practiced what is in that book you would be phenomenally successful like it's you know to me like if you just did the things that are in that book you'd be phenomenally successful
(02:16) um but that's kind of more like personal you know personal traits and character traits and whatnot which i think are very important for you know growing developing but in terms of skills right and i would say the number one you know number one and number two things that i get asked about are like hey how did you develop your skill of marketing and how did you develop your scale of sales and truth be told i never did a single sales training um i never read a single sales book uh before i started selling and so that's i wish i had like a really
(02:43) sexy answer for you but i don't um i just started selling and i didn't even know that what i was doing was selling i was just like how do i get people to sign up for my gym and give me money like i didn't even know that term was sales at the time i was just like i have to get them to give me money and so um i think a lot of people spend way too much time in the like the liberation stage and like they're trying to there you spend all your effort in the i would say like productive procrastination space of just like thinking you're getting
(03:09) better but you would get so much better just doing it right and so only like and people now respect what i have to say about sales because i've sold so much not because of how many books i've read on sales right and so um i think that once i was considered very good at sales i had you know i was managing multiple sales teams and we were doing you know a few hundred thousand dollars a month that is the first time i bought a sales product like think about that and i went through it i was like oh this is good stuff you know like there's
(03:35) there's stuff in here that we can use like neat but like i don't think it fundamentally changed how good i was at selling um and i think that that's because so much of selling is about conviction it's about how much you believe in the product more so than like the the judo chops right it's about how much you care about the prospect and how much you hear about the pro and convince that the product will help them because if you truly talk from a space of genuine care like genuine care about a prospect you won't convince them to do something
(04:00) that they shouldn't do and if you genuinely believe that your product or service is going to help people then making the sales very easy because it's like i really care about you and i really know that this product works and so let me just like help you connect these two dots and so that's like ultimately like that is what selling is and should be the problem is most people don't believe in their product and they don't care about their prospects right and so because of that they come into all this cognitive dissonance
(04:23) meaning like they believe themselves to be good people but at the same time they need to make money and then those two things become at odds and that becomes really difficult to sell because now you're you're faced with a moral obligation um to like your family you know to try and provide and then against yourself to be ethical right and that becomes really hard for people that's why a lot of sales guys get burned out when they find out more about whatever they're selling and so that's why a lot of times sales
(04:45) guys will start start out hot and then crash just because they find out what they were selling with the what they were sold to sell is actually not what it really is cracked up to be and then once they find that out then all of a sudden um that's that's why in my belief there's way more churn in sales people than would otherwise be necessary if they were all selling something they believed in right so back to the main point which is what do i do if i don't like if i have no way of you know practicing well i mean honestly when i when i want to do
(05:13) something what i do is i buy a course about how to do something and then i follow the course and do it so if i wanted to make a webinar then i bought a course on making webinar and then i followed the course to make the webinar and so i learned the skill while i was going through the course i don't think there's a lot of productive time and usage in in learning stuff for the sake of learning like it's like and i don't even i would even make the argument that you don't even truly learn it until you've applied it and so like
(05:41) how do you know if you read six books on sales and they have different strategies which one is is the right one because you've never tested it in the battlefield right it doesn't make any sense and so um like the same thing with marketing i never i never bought a copywriting course i never bought any courses on how to build landing pages i never bought any courses on how to run ads the only thing i did was i spent um i spent money one on one to get someone to train me literally how to click to run ads for my gym
(06:06) but i learned a little bit i learned enough on my own and so that's the thing is like i think there's definitely a space for one-on-one training i think the biggest gains i've made have been from investing in people who are above me to break my beliefs about what was possible because the people were above you most of times are not going to like they're not going to hold your hand and teach you how to write copy this is not going to happen i mean like they might edit you know copy you have if you have like a one-on-one relationship something like
(06:30) that but for the most part like it's going to be up to you to go acquire those skills and most of the time acquiring those skills comes from doing them which means you're going to suck for a while and i think just most people aren't aren't willing to try because they think that if they are perfect they'll somehow not fail the first time which is stupid because even when you're really good you're going to fail so it's just people like procrastinating and reading books about something that they haven't done is a productive way of feeling
(06:53) accomplished without actually doing anything and so um i say all this to say for the many people who who ask me what are my favorite books on sales and marketing my favorite book on sales is to get out there and start selling right because if you start selling and then read a book on sales it will make far more sense to you than trying to read a book on sales before you start selling because you won't even know what they're talking about right same thing with marketing right like if you if you want to go and learn about marketing the best thing to
(07:19) do is start you know learn how to run an ad you run an ad to a landing page and then start getting some people who give you their contact information and then pick up the phone and call them like you know what i mean and the easiest thing to do in my opinion is the advice that i got from ezra firestone years ago which is give yourself a slush fund right give yourself a learning budget which is how much am i willing to quote blow this month on failure so i can learn the skills faster and whatever that percentage is
(07:43) might be ten percent of what you make every month maybe five percent it might be 25 it just depends on who you are and how stable your income is but if you just say i'm willing to give 500 a month to learning the skill then you don't have this like emotional attachment to whether or not you crush it your first time because you're seeing this 500 a month investment is truly that an investment in your education your investment in trial and error rather than uh you know like i bought this question copywriting i'm not a
(08:08) millionaire what's wrong right when in reality you just have to get out there and start doing it so um anywho that's my that is my two cents i i made most of my money before i started reading a lot of books i would say like seriously i read maybe 30 books before we you know were deca millionaires you know what i mean um and so i wish i had something better for you but i i focus most of my time on doing and applying and when i start applying then i will go read for specific solutions to a bottleneck that i have
(08:37) rather than trying to learn an amorphous topic by reading words from multiple books and trying to get perspectives different angles on problems i've never even encountered yet right i think it's much better to encounter the problems than start seeking the solutions than trying to cover every solution to every problem before you've even started the race so anyways hope you found that valuable hope that made sense lots of love keeping awesome and i'll catch you guys soon bye

(00:02) let's give it up for the one the only alex hermosie so i feel like a um stand-up comedian hi could i have you turn around for a second all right the thing you got at the door at the front door now is the time this thing just hang out trust me it won't hurt it'll only hurt for the first five minutes do you get one would you guys not get get these oh [ __ ] never mind i thought every hand over your face everybody never mind sorry we gave everybody one of these well for those of you who did decide to grow a mustache momentarily i do appreciate it um i'll tell you that
(01:06) it looks good i'll tell you that if you want to have lots of negative comments on your paid advertising i highly recommend us a very distinct piece of facial hair that's associated with 70s porn stars and pedophiles i used to get so i still get the notifications on my phone and uh layla like i think only like a few weeks ago she's like you can't keep reading these i was like you know i feel like it's toughening me i feel like it's i'm building character so anyways uh first off i just want to say i'm extremely humbled to be here uh honestly just hearing the few conversations that i was able to have
(01:43) with the people who were here honestly didn't think anyone really knew who we were that's not necessarily a bad thing we keep very much to ourselves i probably don't leave the house for like four or five days at a time so it's a little bit different than i think maybe most people's entrepreneurial journey but nolan am i good to rock can't see him i'm good to rock okay cool so uh kind of what david was saying i like to understand who i'm talking to so i can try and cater this a little bit more to your desires is that cool
(02:12) okay so first thing well without it pretend this is anonymous and no one else knows you're here who here is still working a full-time job can you raise your hand and for like the one moment of the night this i'd ask you to just not do the like hey i'm gonna be too cool to raise my hand because then it like it's to your detriment so the second thing who here is a full-time entrepreneur who's doing a hundred thousand dollars or less per year okay cool who's doing between a hundred and a million a year okay um who's doing a million plus okay cool a nice smathering fantastic
(02:54) all right so um one of the concepts or one of the things that i get asked a lot when i go well on the rare occasions that i go out in public is you know how do i make more money how did you get started what should i be investing in and i think that it's really important to understand that if someone's able to achieve something faster than you they're using the same resources that you have from a time standpoint and so it just means that they're allocating their attention in places that they're getting disproportionate returns on it right and so the objective is how can we find the
(03:29) biggest roi buckets that we put our time into so that we can extract as much value as humanly possible as fast as possible and so my belief in this is that information is the single best investment that you can have because information is the only thing that buys you time does that make sense a lot of people want to go faster but then they don't want to spend money on learning how to go faster and that is the only thing that gets you from point a to point b in a shorter period of time and so where it gets really interesting is how
(04:06) do you acquire those skills and so i'll give you can i give you two like habits that i think have done really well for me in terms of acquiring skills so the first thing is like i was up today at three o'clock in the morning um i'm usually in bed right now so this is my amped voice but i i say that because i also know some i have a few billionaire friends who are who are night owls and so i don't think it's a morning thing specifically i think it's more important that you can always have four to five hours a day of uninterrupted time to yourself
(04:40) the biggest breakthrough that i was able to have in my own life from a business standpoint came when i was able to move the big pieces forward every single day because i started my day that way and for me that's what i'm the most creative is in the morning and so that's where i invest all of my time in getting and acquiring skills just so i have an idea is anyone like an early bird here early birds okay uh what is early before six before five before four okay well um it's really big in our community because like so does anyone know what gym launch does
(05:17) okay a couple people all right can i give you a 60 second pitch on what we do okay so we own a company called jim launch we help small business owners that are specifically gym owners so crossfit's boot camp semi-private facilities uh mma bjj type facilities that are service based facilities um on average increase their top line revenue by 240 000 a year they uh decrease their turn from ten point four percent to six point eight percent month over month which is awesome they triple their profit on average and that's in their first 11 months
(05:46) working with us uh every nine days we create another million dollar facility so we're pretty good at it that has been the focus of pretty much my entire adult life it started when i had my chain of gyms in teller california i was able to open up a new facility every six months as a 23 year old off of cash flow so i pre-sold every facility so that i could open them at full capacity on the first day i thought everyone was doing that i didn't know that that was something that was different and so i had my six i sold them when i was 26
(06:16) and then i started flying out with my lovely wife who is my girlfriend that i met on bumble at the time uh that i got to uh quit her job and join me her parents were very stoked that she left her job for some bumble dude on the internet to go launch gyms and so she uh so we would actually fly out to these gyms and do basically like bar rescue we do gym rescue and uh i did that for six months and then we had an eight-man team and then we did that for another six months so every month we'd go out to eight gyms and launch them and we'd go from zero to
(06:47) full capacity in 21 days and we did that over and over and over and over again that short period of time that i was referencing in the beginning when i was when i had my own six facilities during that period of time i looked back at our crm and i had done over 4 000 101 sales in that three year period and so i had my and that was actually closes because i couldn't count consultations you said no so i did a lot of sales and i'm telling you this because a lot of people ask like how did you get here without knowing how
(07:26) how to replicate what happened and so despite the fact that gym launch in march of 2017 is when we transition to the model that we have now which is an information based model we consult and we help them implement the systems to acquire customers uh send them increase the value of their services and then keep them longer but it's understanding the things that got you there because for us we were able to go from zero to a 50 million dollar a year run rate within 20 months and so a lot of people think that that comes from nothing but a lot of it's the eating [ __ ] period
(08:01) hopefully the profanity is okay and so when i had my conversation with david and some like my sales guys come up to me and they're like dude i got 25 grand you know i'm feeling pretty good so i'm just like curious you know what kind of investments should i be getting into you know like crypto's looking pretty good right now and um and it drives me nuts because i'm pretty sure i didn't have any money in my bank account at any time until i had a million dollars in my bank account within a couple months and the reason for that was because my
(08:36) belief is that you should spend all of the money that you have to acquire skills until you can't spend money on acquiring skills anymore and you can pretty much always spend money on to acquire skills it's you just do it differently and so like the higher up you go now i have to make donations to charities in hundreds and millions of dollars in order to get access to the boards of these charities who are other dudes who can donate hundreds of thousands and millions of dollars to those charities so that i can
(09:01) then see what they know so that i can learn faster and so i'm going to give you an example of what this whole concept of talent stacking is so let's say you're good at math right so that's where you're starting you're like i'm good at math cool that's a skill not very monetizable but it's a skill and then you're like okay well i could kind of do credits and debits keep someone's books great that's a level one skill you've now put two skills together and now you have something that is actually monetizable and then you're like you know what i'm gonna learn accounting all right so i'm gonna get my degree in accounting so i'm gonna become a cpa all
(09:37) right now this is something that is becoming more valuable and then you learn about tax strategies right and then all of a sudden you're able to work with a business and save them hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars a year because of your understanding of the tax code and then you learn how to decrease liability with insurance because you continue down this path of stacking your skills and then if i'm if you're if you're following along and like the next round would be like and then i understood how
(10:05) to talk to bankers and financiers and raise funding and do do exits and equity deals etc same person stacks one talent on top of the other and each talent becomes disproportionately more valuable than the talents all before them does that make sense and so it's it's a it's a it's a hockey stick right and so in the beginning you don't make anything for a very long time and so if you're in the crowd right now and you have not been able to increase your income for an extended period of time which i would define as probably a year
(10:41) if your income has not had a significant increase in that period of time it's because you've chosen to not look or understand what the next skill that you need to stack on top of your prior skill is in the entrepreneur world usually who would consider themselves pretty decent at sales most entrepreneurs right we're more promoter type people and so i hear this stuff all the time there's no good sales people i can't get anyone to sell like i can sell what's the skill that that person lacks they lack the ability to hire
(11:20) find recruit train and manage a salesperson that's lots of skills but that's the essence of what they're missing then they have one or two sales people or three salespeople and they're like man we have good months and then we have bad months and then we have good months i can't keep it solid like why isn't it it's always variable right what's the skill they lack they don't know how to manage a sales team and so the biggest piece of advice that i can say is that it's a frame shift that everything is 100 your fault and at the same time there are self-made
(11:55) millionaires and self-made billionaires but there are also self-made 50 000 a dollar a year ers they just don't claim it because they don't want to be responsible right and so you're 100 responsible for the income level that you have and if you're dissatisfied with it it's because you're just not that valuable and so you have to learn how to become more valuable and the first way to do that is to admit that you have a deficit and so if you have an ego about it you'll be incapable of becoming better than you are does that make sense
(12:23) the people who you see who are really talented and then cap is because they can't admit that they're not good or they could be better i want to give you a different example for the talent stacking because i want to show that like the math one's pretty simple because everyone understands it so let's say jay-z when he started his career he understood he had a rhythm right he was naturally pretty good with beats okay got it then all of a sudden he learned how to perform another skill so he he took his sensitivity to music etc and then he
(12:54) learned how to perform okay great once he learned how to perform then he learned how to sell and market his own materials another big skill then after that he learned how to create a label a more leveraged skill then he learned how to attract and find other skilled performers and bring them into his label and promote them all he did was stack one talent on top of the other and for every additional talent he had he got exponential returns on the stack that was underneath of it does everyone here understand what the next skill that you lack is is there any reason why you're not
(13:31) aggressively pursuing it if you claim to not have what you want if you don't wake up at 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock in the morning and you're dissatisfied i don't get you because for me dissatisfaction is so soul-crushing that like i will do anything to not feel that way and so it might not be in the morning it might be after you put your kids to bed but like there has to be that time where you can invest in learning those skills so that you can stack the next thing so one of the issues with being newer in
(14:04) the entrepreneur space is that you see a course that's marketed you're like copywriting right if i buy this copywriting course it says i'm going to make money right if i buy this traffic course it says that i'm going to make money if i buy this funnel course money sales course money right the reality is that it's all yes's and all knows for me it's just the weekly i choose to dedicate my bank to your first dollar going absolutely wonderful day where you can create all the meaning you want i need to learn how to write copies
(14:48) advertisements on media platforms i need to be able to analyze the data to know how it's actually doing and know how to adjust it based on the performance i need to know how to create landing pages that convert traffic once i have a lead holy [ __ ] i have a lead once i have a lead i have to know how to get that person nurtured in such a way that they will eventually convert and whether that's a phone sale or that's going towards a nurture sequence those are two different paths those are different conversion mechanisms but the points is you see how
(15:18) each of these is a skill that you have to acquire right and so whenever you see these courses don't get butthurt that you didn't make a million dollars after buying one course you're not supposed to and so the goal is to get as many of them as you possibly can the key is having the discernment to know which is the one that you're missing right now right and so like the only thing that i'm not sure how to teach is discernment because it's the only thing that allows you to prioritize and so if you see people who are like i said earlier are moving faster than other people it just means that given
(15:57) the resource that they have that we all have are equal which is time they're able to with discernment allocate that to the highest skill that would be next in this in the stack of skills that they need to learn so my opinion is that if you have twenty five thousand dollars if you have fifty thousand dollars if you have a quarter million dollars if you have five hundred thousand dollars in your bank account i genuinely believe that there is no point to trying to save money if your income is less than two three five hundred thousand dollars a year i don't think there's a point and i mean
(16:30) that genuinely and that's not a diminutive way it's just that saving not going to starbucks to become a millionaire congrats you made 40 years and you enjoyed nothing in life like now you have a million dollars i feel like that's not the i mean is that a life that anyone wanted right [ __ ] that so thank you i'll be here all night um until 9 15.
(16:57) um when i go to bed i'm kidding um sorry entreprened totally where was i yeah yeah so so exactly so my objective for when you should actually consider looking at investments is when you have so much money coming in that even when you're aggressively searching to find a way to allocate the money to acquire the next skill there's still an excess and abundance that is coming on top of it that is the state that you need to get to when in my opinion you have like the alex stamp of approval not that i'm some whatever but i'm just saying like that
(17:36) in my opinion is where it actually starts to make sense the next piece of it is that once you have that abundant flow of money that's coming towards you you also probably have a lot of skills and so then looking at investment vehicles of like bitcoin the stock market real estate you have to also understand because all the things that got you to where you are like i'm petrified of going into real estate because i know that there's guys like me willing to crush me the moment i go in there because they know the game and i don't know the rules yet and so there's a person in every one of
(18:13) your spaces who has a talent stack that far surpasses you and what you need to figure out is deconstruct look at their path so you can figure out what talents they were able to stack together so that they can so they're able to continue to crush you so that eventually you can get strong enough to crush them right and so it takes so long to get good at the game and the amount of effort oh this is really okay i'm trying i wish okay first off i did not know that we could have presentation powerpoints i'm a big visuals person so i apologize but
(18:48) the amount of effort the amount of return that you get from learning a new skill goes down with time right your first 20 hours of reading about sales your first 20 hours of sales in general your first 20 sales consults you will learn more from zero to then than you ever will in the rest of the career of sales but despite the fact that you have marginal returns the absolute incremental return at the end goes up so an example of that would be an olympic runner in the beginning you get much faster much faster right and then as they get better and more advanced and more advanced they're
(19:27) trying to shave off quarter you know quarter seconds from their time and so they put months and years to save a half a second on their 100 meter right right here right at the very end but what's the difference between first and second and third so the absolute return you get on the very small incremental return you get at the very end is where all the juice is when you're just this much better than everyone else at marketing when you're just this much better than everyone else that sales when you're just this much better at messaging and strategy
(20:06) then that's when you go like this and so that's why they have these overnight successes and it's usually because they stacked 20 skills and it was on the 21st skill that the bridge was finally completed and then it popped up has anyone heard the story of the bamboo tree okay one person fantastic so you all be punished for not responding so so i'm i'm pretty sure this is a chinese proverb hopefully i'm not butchering it but essentially a bamboo so if you if you plant a bamboo tree and you keep it underground and you look and you wait a whole season and it doesn't seem like it's growing
(20:44) the stubborn farmer will go and dig it up and try and plant it again be like i must have been a bad seed right and the stubborn farmer goes back a year later ah must have been a bad seed changes the area changes the sunlight changes the watering changes all of these things constantly right but the wise farmer knows that he plants it and it takes five years for the the sapling to break the ground and then within the first three months it's like 60 feet tall because it's spending the whole time digging down rather than digging up so that it can have the root system to support the growth and talent stacking
(21:15) works the exact same way so i want to make sure that i is there a direction that you'd want me to take this at all or is that good or is there a is there like hey i'd like to know more about selling [ __ ] or like hey yes perfect yep love it love it yup i will so he asked an awesome question thank you he said could you give revenue guidelines for what skills you need to acquire at different revenue levels that's a great question i wish i had a graph and i could have pondered it more but if you're under 100 000 a year in your
(22:03) business i'm assuming you're self-employed you probably don't have anyone else who's working for you it's probably just you at that point everything is going to be about promotion right you're going to have to know how to market know how to sell i highly highly highly highly recommend never outsourcing anything for as long as you possibly can so that you can like i still think i'm probably the best marketer in my business even though i have a whole department and i know how to make adjustments on what they're doing and i also know who's trying to [ __ ] me right i know what ad costs
(22:32) are supposed to be and the only way that you know that is having done it the same thing with sales don't try and hire a sales guy because you're like well i'm not good at sales well then that's always going to be a weak link for you and you're never going to have a good sales team because you don't have the the confidence to be able to look back at them in the eye and say like this is wrong you're not doing it right they're going to be like well how do you know and you're not going to be able to have the confidence to look back and have an
(22:54) answer and so in the beginning it's all about okay i'm going to pause that does anyone want to have like the 100 million dollar blueprint okay great so if you want to get to a 100 million dollar valuation type company in my opinion the way that you have to do it is get really [ __ ] good at one thing and this is what david was talking about earlier so i wanted to make sure i brought it up and i mean so good that people start coming to you because of how good you are because how people talk about you if you don't have that happen that is
(23:34) the quota for not being good enough it means you need to keep doing that thing until you have past the incremental return where it starts going like this and in some businesses that means referrals and that's usually what it starts with until you're so good at that thing you do nothing else and it's counter to your entrepreneurial character to stay disciplined enough on this one track because you want to be scatterbrained and chase the next opportunity and dig up your seed and start another one and dig up your seed and start another one i'm going to do fitness for a while actually i want to
(24:04) be a marketing agency actually i want to sell a course actually i want to do a webinar you know affiliate marketing sounds cool sound familiar anyone right if you get so [ __ ] good at any of those things any one of them you can get to 100 million i had a friend who called me and i'm going to complete that i had a friend who called me from high school and he's got a roofing company he was like yeah you know we we buy these homes and then we we we fix them and we flip them and i was like that's awesome man he's like uh we also do windows i was like okay he's like we also do roofs
(24:42) though and that's like really our bread and butter and i was like okay he's like so like you know so this is what i'm thinking we got and i was like great so pick one he's like what do you mean i was like pick one like any one of them can be a 100 million dollar business the biggest fallacy that you have as an entrepreneur is that you need more things to make more money when it's the opposite you need less things to make more money and it's the only way you'll make more money is when you do less so that you can get better and dig deeper
(25:10) because that's how you're going to be better than everyone else because the other guys you're competing against are also scatterbrained as [ __ ] right and so you can out discipline them by knowing that you're going to dig deep and deep and deep and deep i can say with a lot of confidence that there aren't too many people who know how to make a gym as profitable as me it's been really boring for me for a very long time i really understand how to make gyms profitable but we stay here and we still keep innovating and figuring out new things because we try and put blinders on so that i don't look at the other opportunities so that we can keep
(25:42) getting better and better and better once you have your one skill so i'm coming back once you have your one skill you can then monetize teaching that skill now you have a high margin business that has high value because you really are good at that thing now remember it takes years to become good enough that people talk about how good you are before you enter the room and when you leave people like dude that guy's [ __ ] legit that's what you want if you don't have that you're not good enough in my opinion everyone wants to start preemptively but their product isn't
(26:17) strong enough and then they fizzle because they they can't hit the next level because their actual product isn't strong enough so thanks man appreciate it i thought it was the music i was like ah [ __ ] okay um so you have your first skill so you've got your years right we're talking about what revenue levels if you're doing your revenue level it's awesome that you're like that you're making money but you have to just keep doing that thing until you get so good at it that you're stock full like you can't take any more
(26:47) clients and then you raise your prices and then you do it again and then you raise your prices and then you do it again and then you raise your prices then you do it again and you keep doing that and so you're the most sought after at that point you can then sell that skill that you have acquired whether you're a videographer whether you're a graphic designer whether you're a salesperson whether you're a marketer any of those skills are skills that other people value and you can teach people how to do it in a very high margin environment now when you have
(27:15) your high margin environment business it is not a business that has enterprise value because it's you you've just productized your skill does that make sense which means that after you've taken out the profits from that business and that which should 100 percent be your objective in that first phase first is skill acquisition second is monetization of that skill third is reinvesting the profits from that high margin business into a business that does have enterprise value that does not require you so that could be software that could be
(27:47) product that could be anything once you have that you use the talent stack that you've acquired up to this point to grow that business to the point that you can then flip it and sell it does that make sense that's the 100 million plan or billion depends how big you play but that's exactly how you do it if you have no money which is how i did it well hold on not that i did it what i'm saying is like that's who here has funding like from my outside vendor okay three people so for everybody else who's bootstrapping that was for you
(28:22) if you have outside money you can start in different ways and i think that there's some disadvantages to that as well because then there's some talent stacks that you skip over that then you don't know you got this jet pack and then you don't know what the missing link is when you get there so if you hit a plateau who here has been at a plateau for over a year okay awesome great this is for you right now you're not good enough you're not good enough and if you can accept that and internalize it then you can create actions around the thing that you need to do and do over and over and over
(29:00) again the actions that you need to take has to be in terms of number of volume and so what i mean by that is if you're like i'm just not that good at sales cool how many consultations can you get into per day i'm not that good at marketing one of the best things i was ever given was from ezra firestone if you've ever heard of him um he was at a small event a private event with me and some other guys and he said i take a percentage a fixed percentage every month of my marketing spend and i spend it on crazy ideas that i have with
(29:32) zero intention of making an roi and he did that because there was no point in him trying to learn from other marketers at that point because he was above most of the marketers courses that were out there and so the only way that he could learn was by learning in the real world and so each of the skills that you're lacking has a way to do that it can be taking more sales it can be saying i'm going to always create so where's my videographer where's nolan somewhere if i'm nolan i'm going to think every
(30:02) single day i'm going to make two commercials every day i'm going to make two commercials and every day we're gonna run them and i'm gonna see which ones did better and i'm gonna do i'm gonna deconstruct the ones that did well and then i'm gonna try and do more of those until i get so [ __ ] good at it that every single video that i make is a winner and i'm gonna keep doing that and it doesn't take a week or a month it usually takes years right that's how it works i was on a podcast not that long ago and um the host has a slightly younger male
(30:33) audience and he was like you know man i know you always talk about doing the boring work and just like eating [ __ ] and like waking up at you know midnight um he's like and you know you totally suffered and we love that that's great but um so for anybody who like wants that success and wants to just shortcut that like what's your advice to them um and uh i was like you're not going to like you're you're not going to because you're not going to be good enough because the guy who did do that and took 4 000 101 sales is gonna be better
(31:08) and one question that layla and i got at this event a while back was a lady in the audience said how are you guys so certain like when you guys talk about your gyms or when you talk about your business how are you so certain um and i think that level of certainty just comes from being like i did it four thousand [ __ ] times like it's not like it's not like i wake up i say my affirmations like i'm a i'm a gym guru i'm a gym guru i'm amazing i'm an expert you know what i mean i'm an expert like i just it kills me um because
(31:43) it gets to a point where you've done it so many times that it's not amazing it's not fantastic you're just stating observations of history and when you get to that point that's when you've probably acquired the level of mastery that is required to be able to monetize that skill does that make sense okay cool so i think i went probably way over so anyways uh thank you guys i'm very honored to be here i appreciate you thank you [Music] [Applause] [Music]

STEAL Ryan Reynolds' $1.3B Marketing Strategy [NO FAME REQUIRED] - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HwPXctiw_rY

Transcript:
(00:00) Ryan reyolds required over 2 million customers for mmobile with paid ads and I'm going to break down the best paid ads that he's run and how you can model the structure for whatever it is that you sell in your marketing I'm Alex rosi I'm the founder of ais.
(00:16) com we spend millions of dollars every month on ads we make tons of money and no one cares let's start with the first ad at mintmobile we like to do the opposite of what big Wireless does they charge you a lot we charge you a little they put their names on Arenas we put ours on my lower back so naturally when they announced they'd be raising their prices due to inflation we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you and if this were one of their ads they'd end it here with a happy customer so we'll end outs with an angry goat look at the angry goat okay so let's break this down frame by frame now notice though that this is a 30-second ad let's start with the beginning of the
(00:53) ad at M mobile we like to do the opposite of what big Wireless does pause so right here the hook is is basically a contrarian hook so there's a little bit of curiosity here because you're like okay well one you recognize Ryan Reynolds right off the bat and he's got brand placement behind him so he's making the association between him the thing you like and the thing you might not know which is mintmobile and so that's a 101 strategy and there's a reason that I wear this hat and why underneath of my shirt which normally is unbuttoned for those of you who are you wild fellows the reason I I I I rep my
(01:22) brand is to make that same Association if there stuff that you use for my content and it makes you money then hopefully you associate that value with me and acquisition. all right all right so here this is a contrarian hook and uh the curiosity is okay well what's opposite about this thing versus what I my current carrier all right let's hit it they charge you a lot we charge you a little okay pause so this is a clear setup for an Us Versus Them strategy all right and so this strategy is best employed when you are not the market leader all right so obviously mmobile is kind of the underdog they're going the small guy they're trying to face Goliath
(01:55) obviously they're not even close to as big as Verizon and AT&T so uh this strategy makes sense if you're number one you don't want to do US versus them if anything if you want to use an Us Versus Them structure you would use US versus the alternative so rather than another brand or other companies you would be like us versus your couch right if you were like the top fitness brand or something like that they put their names on Arenas we put ours on my lower back so pause so here obviously he's weaving in humor because that's part of his personal brand and so he's basically
(02:25) weaving in kind of like his brand sub bullets as he's going through now every ad has has three parts to it right you're going to have the hook which we covered right at the beginning there's the meat of the ad which is typically going to be the value and then uh at the end of the ad uh there's usually going to be either some sort of call action or a payoff but let's keep going so naturally when they announced they'd be raising their prices due to inflation we decided to deflate our prices due to not hating you all right so here the value
(02:49) is so think about when you're thinking about value Creation in an ad um there's at the most basic level more good stuff less bad stuff all right and so when you're you're writing your ads or you're writing your copy and you're scripting them out I think first from those two buckets and so if we pull out our handy dandy textbook for advertising and you go to 134 so this is the leads book so there's the steps for running paid ads so first uh you have to know where to advertise he's advertising everywhere
(03:17) because everyone already knows who he is and everyone already has a cell phone and so his Market is everyone right now that Parts straightforward the second part is like okay how do I get the right people to see it that's via targeting so I'm sure there's different audiences that look that do better and it might be for Discount providers rather than people who are maybe at premium they might have found for example that uh you know switching someone from Verizon might be more difficult than switching someone from like maybe uh pay on the pay as you go type phone especially
(03:40) given the price points now the third part which is right here step three what should my ad say and so this mirrors that three-step process you got your call out which is the hook you got the value which is the meat and then you got the call to action which is the end besides the kind of General uh uh points that I start that are more common hooks obviously there's not exhaustive you can have unlimited types of hooks that could fit in a book but in terms of uh Concepts he's using contrast here contrast in two ways one is that there's
(04:04) contrast visually like this is a bright color this is something that's going to pop out but then also he's using contrast US versus them that's kind of the theme here all right now from a value perspective we get into the interest step all right and so the interest step is the best ads make benefits look as big as possible and the costs look as small as possible and so from the benefits and cost perspective what we're basically doing is a reverse value equation and so the good stuff is what's the outcome they want which should be phone coverage right you people would want it fast they would
(04:35) want it easy and they would want it to be likely okay now the negative side is going to be what is a nightmare scenario the worst case scenario um slow hard and risky and so as he's describing the benefit here which is less bad stuff the nightmare scenario is that you pay a lot right and you get basically the same thing and if this were one of their ads they'd end it here with a happy customer and pause and so before this he said and we do this due to not hating you right and so again he's he's talking about the knights mercen they charge you more and
(05:07) they don't like you and so he's saying we charge you less and we do like you by implication and then he adds in more humor so let's see it so we'll end our with an angry C look at the angry goat pause so obviously puts a little bit more humor in and to be clear he doesn't actually show an angry customer he shows a sheep right and so it wasn't actually like showing a negative R which other companies like liquid death which is a water company which took the you know took the took the market by storm with cans of water that looked like beer um they actually
(05:38) had ads that were one-star reviews of their product because they kind of went again contrast that contrarian Angle now here we finish with what the CTA right so they make the offer and they tell people mintmobile.com and what do I get unlimited now speed just relative to the cost low done fundamentally sound ad um and obviously brought lots and lots and lots of customers in so if we're thinking about this ad in three slices right we've got our hook we've got our meat or value and we've got our CTA all
(06:08) right and so we covered the hook we covered the CTA let's talk about the meat and so here we've got more good stuff or less bad stuff now on the uh good stuff what we're what we're thinking through here is how can we make it faster so we want describe speed if we can how can we make it easier and how can make it risk-free now if we wanted to improve this offer it would be month-to month not just monthly right now there's some disclosures at the bottom what does it say there limited time only offer Now new activation and upfront payment for three months there we go uh promotion
(06:41) rate for the first three months only again so now we get to understand oh it's only $15 a month for three months and then it will go to who knows maybe it goes to 30 we'll find out taxes and fees are extra so there is more on top of that and what are these fees that they haven't disclosed and unlimited customers using 35 gbt per month will experience lower speeds okay so they do slow you down and video streams at 480p seful terms at mobile.
(07:05) com all right and so that is the fine print on this but big picture though if we wanted to make this more compelling we would actually flip those things we would say okay well your dream outcome is to have unlimited fast right internet and you're not going to worry about getting overcharged or getting your rates turned down in terms of the speed that you're getting downloaded that would make this offer significantly more compelling right now the thing that a lot of people don't do in their advertising is is they don't cover what I call the don't right
(07:31) which is like what's the negative side all right so here less negative um is the uh what are all the things that suck so paying money sucks um which would be and the opposite this is slow uh hard and risky right now in this ad obviously they don't really have that offer uh because a lot of the things they have are they will they will slow you down um they probably made signing up easy they might not make canceling easy um and then the risk is that obviously you don't get what you want now on top of this this is the real
(08:03) don't this is the 2011 version of ads is that we say okay well plus minus so more bad stuff and less good stuff right that happens in your life These are still the same categories but when we when we sell against the don't we say well you could also not do this and instead you say you will have more delays by not buying mintmobile uh it'll be harder for you to use your phone stuff and uh it will be riskier for you to do it that's uh more bad stuff and also you'll experience less good stuff right and so each of these so you can think about these as
(08:38) mirror images of both sides if you do it with us then you're going to have uh less slowness less hardness less risk which means that it's risk-free it's easy and it's fast these just give you different ways of more or less saying the same thing and on the alternative side when we're marketing against someone or some or some idea or some competitor then we're saying basically the converse of that so let's let's break down the next ad Wireless for 20 bucks a month pause so what's interesting about this is they began not really with a hook but they began with
(09:08) the offer and so me right off the bat I'm not like oh now I'm paying attention I would be like all right there's an offer here fine all right continue that's not right pause so the good part that they have here is I do think that they have a reaction which I think is overall like a good thing um I wonder if I were to split test this I would probably Lop off the offer and start at the reaction and then and then flip the order so that then you see the uh the offer just so that there's something interesting there now here they have a
(09:37) mascot which shows up in the next frame I think what the intention here was to take Ryan reynolds's face away from stuff uh and transition it more to a mascot but my guess here is that his Goodwill and his positive brand is probably what drives a great deal of the advertising return above par uh because many people might not know mmobile if it weren't for Ryan Reynolds they might not even know that this is the same company as his all right keep going I choose chunky style milk because it has the wholesome chunks growing kids need pause so right here they're actually doing um
(10:11) is a pretty clever advertising tactic whether or not it was effective is you know predetermined by the fact that they didn't have as many sales as they wanted so I'm giving you a little bit of a foreshadowing here but what they did is they actually just drew an analogy between their service sorry other people's Service uh and chunky milk so this is another contrast style ad they're saying we are a Ferrari they are a clunker right they are a vesa or whatever some small scooter something that's a a huge contrast that basically paints an analogy in someone's head to
(10:40) say we are good they are bad and we keep going the way that branding works is that you don't actually brand in the negative I can't say hey don't think about pink elephants and me well of course you're going to think about pink elephants and now I forever am Associated for those of you who see this with a pink elephant and I will just cry myself to sleep every night because of it but the point here is is that they said we don't want think we want chunky milk and we started the the the video starts with the actual uh brand itself
(11:06) and then subsequently follows with chunky milk and almost the entire ad is talking about chunky milk and that it's disgusting right and so people now just simply associate mmobile disgusting thing all right let's keep going unlike smooth style milk hey guys safe some chunks for me pause so now they complete the loop and say that's not right kind of like your wireless Bell which is a a simile if you want to use kind of like sort of is basically drawing an equivalent between two things which by the way is one of the key ways of educating and
(11:38) advertising with that we still have this character that no one really knows uh which is this random minty Fox uh but he now I think did he have glasses in the begin I don't know anyway let's keep going oh that's not right all right stop so they hit the three here right it's easy it's online which to me would be it's fast like it's not something that you have to talk to anybody so that's taking away some of the the pain associated now they don't really hit risk-free but I guess they kind of lower the risk again with the small price here um and you have clear call to action which is the end of the ad let's hit it right now buy one month and get two
(12:10) months free at mintmobile.com right and so they have their offer and then obviously the call to action is just simply go to the website all right so I think the the mistakes in the ad are that they B they that branding Works whether you like it or not associations occur and so they branded themselves with chunky milk and they took out their biggest uh star which was Ryan Reynolds and so unsurprisingly uh the ad didn't perform as well all right let's go to a good one hey it's Ryan Reynolds owner of mint mobile pause all right so what we're what he's doing here is he's because
(12:41) what we have to think about when you're advertising here because I don't actually think this is an effective Hook from a hook perspective but because this is fundamentally not going to strangers this is going to people who already know who Ryan Reynolds is and so the equivalent to that would be if I'm in a local area and I run an ad and I say hey Talon locals which is a sub you know sub suburb in in Baltimore which is where I'm from then people are going to be like oh this is for me I recognize something one of the four elements of of getting influence with someone is likeness or relatability you're like oh I I know this guy all right so let's do
(13:15) the next one it's the holidays and the big wireless companies are busy spending billions on Advertising all right pause so yet again he continues to hit on this US versus them uh concept and obviously it's working so when you do have something that works keep keep doing it um and so he's drawing this parallel between us and them yet again all right keep going at mint we're not into wasting money so we bought this spiffy stock footage for $500 all right pause so he he delivers One Core brand message here which is that we're not into wasting money now they're a budget
(13:47) option and so it makes sense for this that this ad did significantly better one they have their their main person two he's the focal point three the scripting itself it's like oh you know who I am and I'm not like these guys my value is cheapness and so we made this ad cheaply because we value money that's kind of like I would say the implication of the ad all right let's keep going our footage also came with another hand so we can let you know so he obviously weeps in humor to then transition to the offer and so these ads are super short ads but when you have an ad that's this
(14:17) short and it's going to audiences who know who you are you pretty much just make an offer and so from an advertising perspective Eugene Schwarz has something called the levels of awareness and so the levels of awareness kind of are like this reverse pyramid all right and so you have unaware at the top and this is about the problem so unaware you have a problem aware so they know that they have the a problem you have solution aware you have product aware and then you have most aware when you make your hooks for ads you actually
(14:56) make your hooks depending on what part of this funnel you're actually finding people and so the colder the traffic the the the more different the ad will be now when you have it unaware ad if you've ever seen something that's like Texas homeowners are getting uh reimbursement checks for up to X XYZ in this area or something that's going to drive curiosity and so curiosity is usually the very top of funnel for people who have no idea what this thing could be about and so it has nothing to do with what the with the solution if you've seen like five weird foods that
(15:27) that help you lose stomach fat it doesn't say whether they're going to sell you a detox tea they're going to sell you a zic they're going to sell you a gym membership it starts all the way at the top with curiosity now here's the massive advantage that branded ads people who are already recognized this is what the rock this is what Ryan Reynolds has Etc now every business can do this every influencer business you see who has 50,000 followers and then begins to run ads for example you still use the same exact strategy that Ryan
(15:53) Reynolds is doing the thing is is just that his warm audience is like everyone whereas your warm audience might be like a milon people and so what he's running actually is an ad that's targeted at most aware and so when you're targeting most aware consumers you actually just make an offer that's it and so that's fundamentally what this ad does he just draws a contrast and says by the way we're cheap and you can buy 3 months free and get 3 months free that's it that's the whole ad so in my next book that is coming out I talk about this particular offer structure which is a
(16:24) buy X get y right and so he's got a a parallel structure buy three get three um I would say that I found that buy one get two or buy three get six if you can contrast that you get more free than you pay for it will typically convert better than a mirror structure so I would test buy one get two versus three and three because you would probably uh end up getting you would save money as a business and you might end up still converting more because the discrepancy between what people pay and what they get is higher if you switch to Mint you'll get 3 months free on all of our
(16:56) plans even unlimited feels like that deserves an exclam Point whoa easy easy so he's just explaining the offer here and I I mean if I wrote this ad I'd probably have the CTA um this is yet another joke that he weaves in you could say that this is on brand for him so what's one of the nice things I think Ryan Reynolds does for his own personal brand is that he does weave in direct response advertising which is what this is with what some people might consider branding and so he does very much kind of brand himself in these ads because
(17:26) the ads are funny and he kind of like if you literally look at this ad it pretty much alternates humor moves the ad forward humor moves the ad forward humor moves the ad forward and it's a pretty simple structure in terms of how he's making this and so what we're doing here as we're looking through this in terms of tools is that one obviously he's a he's a celebrity so we just looked at his YouTube video and and ranked the the the videos that have the highest views but I can guarantee you virtually that the ads that are are doing the best are
(17:50) the ones that are being pushed out every single day on meta on YouTube Etc from ads not organic like sure he might get some signups from the 6 and half million views but believe it or not 6 half million views for an ad not that much right now we're pulling up the Facebook ads campaign so if you don't know how to do this by the way you just go faceb just Google Facebook ads library and then you sort and then you type in the the account that you're looking at and it's because Facebook is trying to be transparent they show you every ad that is running for an account and sometimes
(18:15) also ads that are running in the past now the rule of thumb here in terms of looking for ads because you're like well how do I know which one's working well the easy way to do it is just say which one of these ads has been running for a long time and so the longer the ad's been running the more likely that that ad has worked well and so let's say you put out 100 pieces of creative anything that's new will always do better than something that's old but if something is old for a while then it means even though it's old it's still performing really really well so here are some of the oldest ads that they're running so
(18:41) let's let's pull it up wow this is boring okay um despite the fact that uh I think this ad fundamentally from a creative perspective kind of sucks uh it's been running for 5 years or six years so it's probably doing okay now I will bet that this is a retargeting campaign and so this is probably converting very well for people who have already seen some of the top of funnel ads and so um basically if you think about this levels of awareness that I was just talking about retargeting ads are always going to be targeting people who are bottom of the funnel here which is why it makes sense to retarget Simply
(19:25) with the offer uh so it's like hey you saw one or two ads or three ads because we don't know what the audience selection for this ad is but I would make a guess that retargeting ads because um the audience that enters into the retargeting bucket basically the new people that see the new ads uh and watch past a certain point or click to the site are a much smaller subset and change frequently you actually keep the creative the same because the bucket of eyeballs changes whereas when you're hitting a mass Market on a regular basis everyone's seeing the ad so you actually have to have far more creative top of
(19:56) funnel than you do bottom of funnel so if we just look at this this is an offer recap essentially so it starts with the price tells you what the what the dream outcome is if we're looking at our original framework we're reversing risk right so we're just hitting through these through the buckets of value uh it's cheap it's fast and it's guaranteed and this is a humor thing at the end there um and then again they'll restate the price all right so let's look uh further up the funnel because I think that'll be more fun and so it seems like they have two very uh different
(20:27) categories of ads which I think every business should do and if you're not doing this right now like do it I don't know I'd like do it but look at look at look at how Native these ads are right these are clearly iPhone these are clearly user generated content so ugc um and they're just displaying them as is so they they opted for a more basic look and so some big Brands would be like I don't want to show this type of content cuz it Doesn't reflect on my brand well um obviously they're going for the scrappy Underdog looking feel and the fact that they're a budget provider kind of makes sense that
(21:01) that they would use this Me by and large I tend to lean towards using ugc because it's like unlimited creative and you can just test it really easily and I've talked about how creating ugc Loops uh with an abysses can just give you endless ad creative but let's actually watch this ad from beginning to end here's my honest review of M Mobile's and limited all right stop so honest reviews if you look at search volume for any business reviews is almost always the second or third thing that comes up and so this is obviously something that people are going to want to know and so it makes a really strong hook and then the believability Factor here is I don't
(21:33) see any disclaimers on this ad uh and so it appears that this is not a paid actor this is actually just somebody who's a user who's giving a review and I'm going to bet it's a good one let's go and first off I don't have time to get my main for my book all right so I mean he's already framing whatever he's about to say as he's actually edifying himself believe it or not as you should trust my opinion uh for what I'm about to tell you because I am the type of person who likes cheap stuff all right they call to the boogo king second we're offering $15
(22:02) a month for the first three months for the new C pause so they don't have disclaimers around uh who he is but they do have disclaimers around the offer itself which you can see at the bottom there so it's $45 up front all right so he said $15 a month but when you actually uh go to go to buy it it will probably be more which you can see there all right I paid $5 on I have't looked that there we go so he did say he does include the upfront fee okay that feels good I had to pay my phone three months it's been well so from an offer structure here he
(22:31) begins with 15 and then he says he paid $45 because he bought three months so they so from from a from an advertising perspective what they're doing is pulling cash flow forward so they can afford to acquire the customer and so if you pull the three months forward then they're going to give six months because it's a buy free buy three get free he said he's the BOGO King buy one get one right so they buy three so 15 time three that's 45 and then there's another three months afterwards so likely he's not going to get build for 6 months after
(22:57) paying $45 which is fairly comp offer all right the service the service hand be great it's wonderful call me be me if you want to reach me word again possible so what is the biggest concern someone has so there are these two pricing scientists called van West or it's one guy I think his last name is Van West anyways and so there are uh kind of four uh questions that you can ask when you're trying to figure out what to price something so the four questions are number one what is a price that's so high that you wouldn't even consider buying it the second question is the Other Extreme which is what is a price that's so cheap you wouldn't believe
(23:29) that it would work that it wouldn't actually function and then the two questions in between are what price is just high enough that you'd consider doing it you'd ultimately buy it but it would it would hurt or it would sting or it would be uh something you have to think about before making the purchase and then on the kind of like the from the upside is like at what price do you think this would just be a great deal all right and so what they're hitting on here is when the big fears that that a budget consumer is going to have which
(23:51) is okay it's $15 a month but am I going to get service is anyone even going to hear me like is am I always going to have one bar at all times like that would suck right and so he's hitting on the biggest fear that a customer is going to have so if you think about the value part of the ad he's saying less negative and more positive so you might be wondering less negative no more positive and so it's a very simple structure and you can also stack multiple of these in a row if you have a longer ad that you're trying to run all right let's hit the rest can made the
(24:19) source of mobile save some money and reinvest and so he actually makes the CTA at the end which is brilliant I mean that I mean it's very kind of him maybe they ran an ad contest uh for people to you know submit their ads maybe they didn't and this guy just liked making fun videos who knows maybe he's a great Creator we have no idea um but by and large though uh it's a fundamentally sound ad this guy gave a good hook he edified himself he said uh what he loved about it he gave the price uh and then he said what's your biggest fear it's less bad stuff more good stuff great
(24:50) benefits to you save some money invest call to action straightforward ad all right so now let's go back to Ryan R so you'll notice though they have far more ugc ads that are that are running and that's because ugc you just get so much more creative because it's it's it's leveraged right you can use the entire Community people all of your customers which I think a meta concept here that any business owner can take I I mean I am a massive advocate of this is try and build the advertising machine within the
(25:14) business itself that way you don't always have to generate 100% of your ads you only have to generate 20% or 10% of your ads on a regular basis and you let your community of customers generate the other 90 all right let's hit the next Ryan Reynolds hey it's Ryan Reynolds and this year our holiday commercial is just S 5 pick up for $5 for a yard sale oh good we're still doing this doing what well the holiday offer all the wir company stop doing errs in January so I want to make sure that we don't stop
(25:39) loving our customers just because December's over is future me micromanaging and am me just just got to be offer it's zero commercial now I am sufferable this is how you're using time travel you irresponsible son of a [ __ ] so let's break this down uh frame by frame in terms of the ads so we go to the beginning boom he introduces himself hey it's and so I will bet that they have found that when he introduces himself uh that hook tends to work because everybody kind of knows who he is and so in some ways it's like it's it's not a true direct response cold uh
(26:18) Market open because no one who's really watching this and buying is cold traffic everyone kind of recognizes who Ryan Reynolds is and so they just reinforce that with all the brand trust that he brings to it which is fundamentally why he did the deal to do this to to to invest in this business and help grow it all right let's do it this year our holiday commercialist just St I picked up for $5 from a yard sale oh good you're still doing this pause so the $5 from the yard sale he doesn't even show any of it and it's just kind of this like random add in um and so this ad is primarily humor driven the Clone version
(26:50) is something that many many companies have used this angle and this is more of a behavior science thing but seeing two people who are ident pacle draws a lot of attention like think about twins of any kind I'm not going to get into anything else there we'll just leave it at that all right twins are inherently more interesting like you look back and forth you look back and forth and it's attention grabbing any people now if they wanted to make this even crazier this is the the the behavior side um if
(27:15) they actually had them acting in sync uh it would draw even more attention just from a from an advertising perspective but obviously there's a little bit of banter here all right let's do it what well the holiday offer all be called we stop doing errs in January so I wanted to make sure that we don't stop loving our customers so yet again they have their winning theme which is US versus them and they hate their customers and we love our customers and so they are continuing to run the ad also as a total side note um if the ad converted which I'm assuming it did uh they actually got
(27:45) a lot more runtime on it because of the excuse they're using for why they're going to continue to run this promotional offer now they've been more or less running the same offer this whole time and so inside of my offers book I talk about this so the last chapter in $100 million offers is the magic headline formula and so once you figure out what your offer is going to be you then basically bundle it over and over and over again and so same bundle different rapper and so during the Super Bowl I'm sure they'll call this their Super Bowl promotion during the holidays
(28:15) they'll call it the holiday promotion during the Spring they'll call it their Springtime promotion during the summer they'll call it their sumtime summertime and when it's fall they'll call it the back to school promotion and so you don't actually have to change the offer once the offer is winning you just change the wrapper around the offer to make the offer feel new and different when in reality it's still the highest converting offer you've got and uh I I talk about this a little bit more length uh in this chapter but I like to think
(28:37) about it as being like a fraternity party planner so back in my fraternity days uh you didn't really need to have a reason to have a party because you're in college and parties are what you do but you would invent a reason why so it's like John got his wisdom teeth pulled ker right and so you would just think about anything any reason why you can imagine and at the end of the day customers don't care what the reason is they about the offer but the reason itself creates novelty and I think if you are a small business I think this is one of the most underutilized advertising angles is think about
(29:06) ridiculous thing it's my dog's birthday and because of that I giving two months free to anybody who joins my gym whatever right it like I turned 37 7 weeks ago and as a result I'm running a sweek promotion like it doesn't matter but the ma the thing that does matter is the offer and they already tested that so once you nail the offer you just go endless variations and wrapping paper on it so now let's look into this and there's an interesting little tidbit here that I think anyone can take so they have a lot of ads from this
(29:34) particular Creator so this may be an influencer this may be somebody that they paid we'll see if they disclose that regardless you can see that there's a lot of ads from this Creator so I'm guessing that they did pretty well or that they paid her a decent amount of money to make a lot of ads now what I'm curious about is whether they kept the meat of the ad the same and just alternated the hooks or if they actually made entirely new ads so let's let's let's check it out he say if your grown up sign your own phone we your man
(30:00) is lesson two of these opies per montho all hands are $50 month three new so Haron advantage and all right so this is actually pretty good advertising um and I I'm going to I'm going to break down why so the Ryan Reynolds ads don't follow traditional direct response because they start with him just saying who he is because it's not really direct respon well it is direct response but it's going to the most aware audience but for many of us business owners people don't know who we are and so we have to start with something uh a little
(30:33) bit different so people might not know who she is and so we start with the call out right which is people noticing your ad is the most important part of the ad by a lot if we're thinking about this we need them to think oh this is for me that is the thought that you want someone to think or feel the moment they begin the ad because then that means that you have paid you've gotten them to pay attention all right so if I am a parent I might pay attention because I'd be thinking about my kids and if I'm a kid I might think about now if I'm sing person I might just ignore this that all together all right and
(31:02) we're is two ofice per month so this is why I said I think this is good advertising so if you're going to mass Market again this is a this is drawing an analogy or metaphor right and what's really clever about this is that they're just translating $15 into what the real cost is for somebody on an everyday um expense that most people just don't really consider a real price or real actual cost and so you'll see this in a lot of different companies and I do think it's really clever advertising um because I think it makes the price real
(31:38) for people and if you've noticed uh like sometimes insurance plans would be like for less than a dollar a day you can insure your loved one and so you can say it as the price so be like for her it's 15 so $15 a month they could say for less than 50 cents a day um obviously she just say two coffees a month but I would imagine like you could probably say for less than a pack of gum a week right you could you could do a different like that would be a hook that I would think would probably work just as well
(32:02) as the coffee I think coffee's been a little bit overdone because a lot of people do things in terms of coffee at the same time maybe people do that because it works so um I would probably alternate if this is me being the creative director I would alternate different props here um that would resonate potentially with different audiences there now if we're going for kids how many of them are buying expensive coffee I don't know what things are they buying that are in that price range I would probably look at
(32:25) that as some of the substitutes i' look at for the analogies or metaphors that I draw in uh to compare the price of My Thing versus The Thing and here's the key part that they're already spending money on all pans are $50 B for the first remas adue customers so St taking advantage of your par andage off so all we're doing all all they're doing here is just restating the offer so this is pretty straightforward and then they put a little joke at the end fine and so actually the last few words it ends soon is drawing upon urgency and so uh what's what's
(32:57) interesting about this is from a compliance perspective for advertising um the promotion could end soon I'm not sure how uh compant it is to have a promotion end soon and then the same offer Begin Again the next month for a different reason so I don't know if your holiday promo ends on the first and then on the second your spring promo starts but it's the same offer uh that seems great to me I personally don't care I think it's fine but in terms of uh legal people uh you can take it up with them um but the
(33:27) the the part that's key here is that if you can uh pull urgency which is one of the elements of an amazing offer right here page 112 um you want to say urgency is by X date or X time and so now they're saying and soon okay that's how they do it so soon is subjective and so soon soon could be for me 10 years from now that is how they uh they were able to have some little urgency around their CTA and probably have a compliant I'm glad we got through that together let's look at the next ad here uh and the key
(33:57) part that I want to look at is this is the same Creator so I want to see if they're doing similar hooks or they're just doing entirely different ads all together let's do it welcome to a conversation between me and a big Wireless sales you like to save money on your phone bill in the New Year I'm taking advantage of n Mobile's new customer offer right now for their unlimited plan you can 100% guarantee that if you go with us you'll save huge compar to your current plan how much you hang right now with mobile oh $15 a month they the largest IB Network in the
(34:22) nation and I offer you a similar plan at a much higher price just watching the last ad and this one what is now clear to me is that they're running viral organic formats and so the first one started with a PSA PSA grown to your own fan all right and so psa's I'm guessing um that format probably was a viral organic format and if this is a Creator which I'm assuming she is um I don't know her name is but I'm assuming she's a Creator I'm sure you guys can let me know in the comments um she now has another format that is a is a fairly
(34:55) common uh viral organic format uh somebody who's done a really good job of this is Erica Colberg she does like Financial stuff and she does a lot of conversations or pseudo conversations that happen between Representatives company and her she does legal stuff but like fundamentally exact same format and so that's the format but if we're looking at the theme guess what theme it is yet again US versus them right and so they have just found that from the Underdog perspective that theme works well why didn't no one tell me about mmob yal I'm honestly shocked that this
(35:25) isn't blowing up my be right now you can get mmob United pay for $15 a month three mon when as a new hust and I love about it is it's reliable affordable it's a news deal so it ends soon you want to pay less three your phone plan in 2025 don't wait in the mobile rather deal while you still hand I'll right here for you we basically just have a hook and then a ton of urgency all right now the thing is is that yet again she says it ends soon now reason why it was new year so that makes it a little bit more believable or compelling but at the end of the day they could run this New Year's plan for like six months who knows all right now the hook here is a
(36:00) pretty common hook for like reviews and things like that that happens in organic um I will say that for those of you who do consume organic shorts like this on a regular basis you probably have seen these and it almost this is me personally just saying this this is a pretty common structure for people who get paid to do an endorsement and they're like why has no one told me about so and so's protein powder it tastes so amazing I thought it was going to be right and then they go into it right um all right let's just go to the next one because you'll notice there actually let's let's just hit the number of times she hits UR in this cuz I think
(36:28) that's actually kind of interesting I'm honestly shocked that this isn't R right now you can get P for $15 a month for the first three months when you sign up as a new customer but I love about it is it's reliable affordable hereo it's a news deal so two also it ends want to pay less for your phone plan in 2025 don't wait mobile rather steal so she makes five urgency ctas in in basically last 15 seconds of the ad all right so um obviously this is direct response being the goal to get someone to respond immediately for the ad he is agan not M the sale put the date in your phone February that is when mob offer
(37:11) for $15 a month for the first three months of new customer in yes you could go the rest of the winter only paying $45 for a Pham pan without compromising on quality the savings here are insane commu to wireless so make sure you so let's let's I think this one's worth breaking down PSA do not miss the so that's the hook right so again she does the PSA thing and so the PSA is yet again a viral format something to consider if you are running ads is look at what organic formats are trending uh for creators and there are formats believe me there are formats and
(37:47) try and see if you can get your ads to mimic that format because then it will look more native uh and when you have like fundamentally the best advertisements are things that don't look like advertisements and like if if you this were think like this if this were just a Creator who were making this recommendation you'd be like wow it' be incredibly compelling and so the more it can look not like an ad uh then the better in general it'll convert all right so let's do the next thing I'll put up this date in your phone February
(38:12) is pause so they do actually have an end to this promotion and so now this is again a hard push on urgency but we've looked at a bunch of ads all of them have at the same price which is $15 um and so that obviously is the price point that they have seem convert and having the three Monon offer is what's working and an's offer of unlimited data for $50 a month for the first three months of new customer in pause so same restatement of offer she's just explaining what it is and if you are making an offer you just want to do it as as clearly as possible and you can see the disclaimer in the middle of the screen if you do have terms around
(38:45) payments like for them obviously it's they're paying it all upfront then that comes and there's obviously rate limiters in terms of how fast it is um but she tries to attenuate that big concern which obviously I'll bet you if they are uh good advertis ERS which they are they probably read the comments and the number one concern by the way big Pro tip here if you want to know the things that you need to include in your ads in terms of what concerns prospects have not customers but prospects have is actually just read the comments because people will tell you their objections for why they didn't sign up or why they what they don't like about your thing
(39:18) and then in your next batch of ads you can include those key points and overcome them all right you could go the rest of the winter only pain G pan without compromising on quality pause so two things here one is she just restates the offer in a different way so instead of $15 per month for three months she then just translates it again saying that means $45 until the end of the winter all right so it's just a different way of restating it which I think is worth doing because sometimes it just hits different for different audiences and
(39:46) sometimes it's like oh that actually I mean sometimes $15 a month for three months for some audiences will convert and for other audiences $15 or $45 until the end of the winter might be even more compelling I would say for me personally I think that is actually more compelling all right now the last part that you said is without compromising on quality now I think that in other ads they hit harder on the fact that the quality isn't compromised she just puts a little oneliner in there because it's the biggest concern anyone would have with a budget provider the here are
(40:16) insane big picture here um they're running a pretty clear direct response strategy um they're leveraging ugc uh which every business can should have if you have a brand spokesman then introducing them obviously in this Ryden Reynold scenario he continues to do it so I'm guessing that it works um I would be curious to test I haven't seen it I'd be curious to test what a cold or harder hook uh would do with Ryan Reynolds as the person in the ad like that would probably be one of the first things I would test if I were testing offers I would look at by one get two or by two get four um and see
(40:54) how that converted uh alternatively by three and three is fine nothing wrong with it but I would those are things that I would test the hell out of um I'm I'm assuming that sometimes you can break it back from what number converts so $45 may be the number and then it's just like how many ways can we mix and match uh $45 right what's that you guys want to see where all of this traffic is pushing fine we'll also look at the landing page let's do it okay so this is mobile.
(41:22) com which is their CTA uh in every ad all right and I do think big picture um if you have all your traffic pushing to one page um then you want to make sure that it's all congruent and actually it's a huge mistake I think a lot of marketers make is that you have all these different creative Hooks and stuff but then like you don't actually go for congruence and one of the easiest ways to drop conversion is have someone click somewhere and then not get what they think they're getting and so a lot of the elements here are look okay let's
(41:46) just look at this page here all right so right on the top time is literally ticking so they're showing true urgency um right at the top big banner um saying like you need to act now now on top of that they have a banner across the top that is probably also something that moves forward in the funnel and uh if you look at acquisition.
(42:05) comom for example we have a banner across the top because it's actually one of the most clicked buttons and so you can have the same CTA with multiple buttons on the page and in general rule of thumb not forever but if you only have one CTA on a site if you add another you will increase conversions if you add a third you'll also probably increase conversions at a certain point you have too many referees on the field and no no one can see the actual offer but in the beginning two three sometimes ctas in terms of button for someone to take action will usually increase the conversion of the page all right now we're hitting they're
(42:35) basically just slamming you over the head with urgency now they don't have scarcity because it's unlimited customers so that's not where they're hitting they're just going on time here so big picture for those you don't know scarcity is uh uh limiting quantity urgency is limiting time and so people talk about scarcity and urgency interchangeably and that's not how it actually works all right there separate things that can be combined but they exist separately all right now they do have a caveat it's new customers all right so it's not all customers but new
(42:59) customers get 3 months of unlimited premium Wireless for $15 a month all right so let's I mean it's pretty clear what they want us to do here let's scroll down let's go all the way down is there anything else there okay so two plant for the price of one so if you switch from one of their primary competitors uh they have a separate offer for you there all right now let's look at the secret sauce I'll bet you this is optimized for mobile too all right so 5G for free we're online flexible payment plans okay
(43:30) uh bring your own everything fine so what's really interesting about that b bye um another budget provider which you may have heard of which is Spirit Airlines uh has the same thing they call it your ass and gas so they say like we give you nothing and they kind of lean into how cheap they are and they are the cheapest provider but they do nickel and dime people so let's scroll back up and let's actually let's go like we're going to convert so why would they have so because this is this is this is actually like Dev work that they'd have to put in
(43:54) so there's probably a reason they added this bar in I would imagine the number one concern which they also talk about in their ads is what's the service quality right and so someone's like I'll switch to it if there's really good coverage in my area and so they're probably resolving one of the biggest concerns so let's just do acquisition.
(44:11) comom zip so yep there we go all right so there we go so they tell us that our device is compatible and they have excellent coverage now I'm going to be real with you um my question would be is like what's excellent now they do have a map so they can visualize it okay so they've got some towers that looks like it's right there at the corner but all right if I'm trying to make a decision I might say well they said it's excellent so I guess I'm going to consider so now we go view plans so let's do that okay so this was actually leads us to the same place as the original button so if someone takes a detour and then goes there pretty it
(44:42) basically you handle the objection and then they go back to the sale all right so choose your plan all right so let's see what we got here we got 3 months 6 months 12 months they obviously want um you know they're drawing attention to the 3-month offer and so what's interesting is that they have the same starting fee but just different ongoing fees after the fact to me the six-month offer is a dummy offer and I'll bet you they have their their split between the three and the 12 and so like look at look at why they
(45:12) would do this so it's like okay well I can only commit to three months and then it's $30 a month or I can pay $35 a month uh with 210 up front I'm like I don't know like for me if I look at this I'm either 3 or 12 and so when you have three tiers by the way you almost never want the three tiers to be evenly split so we're going a little bit into pricing but YOLO we can do what we want it's our video so so where you move the middle on a three tier offer determines where you want to nudge the customer okay so if I
(45:46) want more people to take my uh 12mth offer I will make my six-month offer really close to the 12-month offer and so I'm like oh well well shoot this is so close I'll just I'll just do that one right so this is the typical small medium large soda play that movie theaters has done for ages right so let's say that you've got equal ounce differences between uh between sodas okay so let's say that this is 10 ounces this is 15 oz and this is 20 ounces okay so that's what that's what these sodas are obviously at a movie theater it' be like a gazillion ounces and they just give you a gallon of whatever soda you want all right here here you're asking
(46:28) someone to make a logical decision and it's proportional to how much they buy and they're not really saving anything by buying more so functionally this would incentivize people to go here because there's no savings for buying more and if you wanted to just get some more later you take on less Risk by buying a smaller purchase and you could always just double up again later if you so desired now what does this next pricing tier tell you so let's say we keep our $5 and then we have $6 here and then we've got $10 here what does this tell you that tells you here that this
(46:59) is the best value option the first is here now let's look at a different pricing scheme so if we have $5 uh on the low option but let's say that now we've got $9 on this option and $10 what is the pricing CH that we're pushing towards we're like well dude for an extra dollar I'm getting another 5 ounces this is not a bad gig now because of this uh basically dichotomy between the 10 and the 20 um we would probably realistically what this would probably be priced at like if we were in the movie theaters this would probably be eight bucks this would probably be seven and so this would then push more people
(47:36) to hear right and so how you pric your three options you can tell what offer A smart business owner is trying to incentivize you to take so it depends so we're getting into a little bit of advanced pricing but you're an advanced person so let's talk about it all right so if I have this $6 option what does it really communicate well you think like for a dollar more I'm going to get 50% more soda that's a pretty good deal for here for a dollar more I get another 5 ounces of soda and so these prices are always taken in in aggregate right now
(48:09) if I have a lot of people coming in the door and everyone's buying Smalls and I want them to upgrade then I'm going to put my price here if everyone's cominging in and they're getting mediums and I want to push them the larges then I'm going to move my price of mediums up to make the large more appealing so what you're ultimately trying to do is maximize Revenue per soda buyer right and so it'll depend where your average customer is actually entering the business to determine which of these you would actually push uh so this is a sales page all right and so sales pages are different than landing pages so the
(48:41) first page was relatively short just wanted to get people to take the next step and they have probably tested pushing people straight to the sales page and it probably doesn't convert as high so they have that intermediary step to get more qualified uh people to the page why does that work no idea I can just tell you that often does work when you have too much traffic going and not enough conversion you add a step you add friction and then it sorts the right traffic all right so let's look at the actual page structure here so let's go
(49:05) to the top so boom big thing we have our urgency yet again and then we have our offer right there in bold so that everyone doesn't miss the thing last chance yet again 50% off cool okay they're restating the offer multiple times and then they restate the benefits underneath highp speed so if you're looking at this you've got headline subhead and then three bullets which is a really common structure that I talk about um and it's interesting because above the fold which is when someone loads on their phone you'll see a very common uh
(49:35) structure in the paid ad section 147 I talk about three different landing page structures that work really well and so what they have here is they're using layout three above the top all right so they've got headline subhead right so unlimited premium is headline subhead is last chance and then the three bullets right here now they have I have mine below below the button they have theirs above minor difference but fundamentally they're using this structure now notice I have attention Avatar at the top what do you think that is that's time is literally ticking and it says new
(50:03) customer offer so Avatar is right there attention new customers all right like these are Timeless advertising principles because they work this is how this is how you convert traffic all right so we've got the button I one tiny tweak I would consider on this page is I think the button is not visible enough and so I would consider making that more uh I would make it jump out more uh because I think you could easily miss that all right so let's scroll down it says choose your PL now it's telling you what to do okay great so now um this is just all plans include this are you new
(50:33) great and then just restates the offer yet again all right um and then we see our our three six and 12 month plan now they made it uh userfriendly for mobile so that you can you know toggle between them uh which I think really interestingly so imagine the user experience here so if I'm looking at this I'm going see $15 a month and I go to six six months up it goes up and then I go to 12 months $15 a month huh what is that telling me to do well I came for the three but man this one for 12 isn't bad and so what's interesting about this
(51:03) is that the intro offer is is 15 a month and then it bumps up right but the 12-month offer is 15 a month and then it stays 15 a month and so if someone has a sensitivity to that price point then they basically make it available to them it's like hey if you want to stay at 15 a month you can you just got to make the commitment right all right so let's let's scroll down a little more all right did you know once three months are up your new customer offer you can renew yeah so they're saying hey if you can't so this is a if you can't decide right now don't worry you can change it later which is a great re risk reversal all
(51:33) right so facts so now they're getting into features here and they're probably going to show speed because what's the biggest concern everyone has coverage and speed all right so they're going through these things and for us we already checked our ZIP code beforehand which they helped observe now I don't think anyone's going to know anything about this like like I honestly and maybe this is a compliance thing that they have to show which is very possible um so that one I don't know it might be a legal thing all right let's scroll down cuz obviously this is not going to convert anyone okay bring your family so this is an upsell potential so it's like
(52:02) okay not while I've got you cuz what's another concern someone has well I don't want to switch on my own I want to bring my whole family over because I don't want to be a separate plan than them cool so they gave a family plan all right now yet again we scroll down to the bottom and if you missed it because let's say you think about click Journey right so someone clicks over and they didn't they just went straight to the offer now that they're actually in consideration so they're thinking am I going to am I going to take this offer
(52:26) am I going to take my credit card out they might now this the coverage device Checker is what I consider a buying question and so sometimes on a sales call this is obviously doing this in in a virtual setting but there are questions that are like there are questions that are kind of more open-ended like Discovery questions that a that a customer would ask and if someone says like talk to me about payment plans right that's a buying question they're strongly in consideration and so this is something
(52:50) to help overcome any obstacles around purchasing so they were like okay the price makes sense if you have it in my area um I I'll attend your your gym how far away are you from me right that's going to be a real consider like and if you're close enough they have some line in their mind that if it's over it it's acceptable and they'll make the they'll make the purchase all right so scroll down and this last section is super common um on a sales page which is FAQs all right so almost always having an FAQ on a sales page will increase conversion
(53:21) because just think about every one of these questions as a couple percentage points of customers that haven't gotten all their questions resolved yet and either want a deeper explanation for some of the sentences or headlines from above or they have some unresolved concerns that didn't really make sense to weave into the page because it would overall lose some people and so you basically stack those at the bottom and you've probably seen this on a lot of pages even if you look at like an Amazon uh purchase page they're going to have their FAQs at the bottom where the the seller will answer some of the questions that people are asking all right and so
(53:50) if you by the way if you want a really great way to study like how to make sales Pages study Amazon think about about how they structure their pages and how many elements of persuasion are woven in that are real and actual now they obviously you know they're a trillion dollar company and so they have a lot of resources at their disposal but you can still use the elements of persuasion that they have right and fundamentally that's what they're harnessing here and at the very bottom I see this as a um if you haven't decided
(54:17) to buy yet why don't you enter our long-term nurture sequence where we'll send you emails to hopefully get you to buy later right and so that's basically what we're doing here so so so what's that you you want to see the emails that they send to convert more customers fine we'll look into them okay so uh Big Picture This is their actual email sequence so we looked it up you'll notice that these are very visual so these are very um picture driven so I want to make a clear Point here it's I would say it's very split in
(54:48) the types of products that are being sold what types of emails convert and so I've seen this is just me Alex's point of view um pictures do really well with physical products and low ticket items uh so people just like click and buy right if you sell services or complex services or complex products or high ticket products often times basically almost the exact opposite uh perspective this which is lots of text um that's plain text maybe one hyperlink that's all not formatted to basically make it look like a real email that someone might send to you that tends to be the best deliverability
(55:26) which will ultimately convert more people for those more complex things so if you sell services that are complex I would lean towards that here if you're e-commerce which fundamentally this is e-commerce it's just a phone service that you're getting um it makes sense now one last Point here is that notice that they don't offer phones remember the booe so they're able to sell at a much lower price point because most of the other carriers include the phone in some sort of payment plan with your service and so a big portion of what you're paying for is the th000 smartphone that you're you know sub that
(55:56) they're subsid ing for you over X period of months with a decent uh markup all right so let's look at the offers they have so email one is they just say they just restate the offer cool let's go to the next one all right uh now they say it's easy so let's think about the elements of value here right so first they restate the offer then they say by the way it's easy now the makings of mitt mobile so now they're saying okay someone didn't take the first two so now let's just give them a little bit more information right let's talk more about
(56:25) the value that they're getting that's the next email yeah and so here they're also telling a little bit of the of the of the story of the founder or or at least the spokesperson and so this would be more common if someone hasn't made the purchase for you uh purchase with you yet you're explaining more about yourself basically trying to build some trust build rapport with Prospect all right let's go to the next one all right so now they're hitting the family people and they're like maybe you didn't buy because of this reason you might have missed it on the site and so
(56:49) what they're really doing is they're chunking down a lot and just focusing on one obstacle at a time which is what I would encourage you to do in email followup is there's going to be let's say 13 reasons people aren't going to buy and instead of saying here's 13 Reasons let's handle them all you just hit one email at a time that hits each reason in order of prevalence meaning the more common the concern is the earlier on in the email sequence it should be all right now uh here's the 411 on Sim so this is like this is going to be a concerned question this is a detailed
(57:21) question where someone's like we do what about uh SIM cards what what about my use case I'm a special snowflake so they're covering the special snowflake scenarios um in this and I would imagine they continue down this process now if I had to rate this email followup um I would probably rate it like I'm being real probably a five out of 10 um main reason here is uh you know they're just hitting basic they're just restating the offer and over and over again um I think that what could make this better is if they made it feel a little bit more tailored right and so if they could
(57:54) expand in personalization now I don't know what segmentation they have in the background but personalization their marketing and um thinking about onboarding a customer before they're a customer um is a great way to take people get get people to do those first steps like that coverage question that they have it's like can I get someone to take a micr step towards me right and so I'd be thinking what other things are kind of micr steps that get someone who who Who's going to get further along the the road of consideration before they make a purchase another one would be like okay can we give can we deliver
(58:23) them some sort of lead magnet so once we have their zip it's it's like here's other people in your area who have said that this is really good that would probably be really compelling another type of testimony I might might read um someone who's like you another one might be someone who considered buying at the same time as you and is now already enjoying the benefits right and so people thinking cohorts so it's like if I considered buying this last week and it shows someone else who did buy last week and is enjoying the benefits it becomes more compelling because you you
(58:51) double down on likeness that person's just like me all right um uh additionally you can reference my my Rihanna video on some of the things they did for their offer but in this offer having birthday and anniversary offers is just it's wonderful reason why to extend personalized offers to people that will increase their specific urgency but the thing is is that you know that every month you've got one 12th of people who returning a certain age and so you've got basically one sixth because you've hit anniversaries and birthdays every single month that are getting a special offer and so if
(59:21) you do that on a regular basis it's like every month you get this kind of lift to one sixth of your audience that's getting a special offer specific to them all right and so um here are a couple actionable takeaways that I think you can take away from their site to convert more out traffic so number one is website optimization so if you haven't tested your page load speed um just do it and then most tools will tell you some of the things that images that need to be compressed um so that you can decrease file size and ultimately load faster now this may not sound interesting but for every 1 second saved
(59:51) you get I think I think Neil Patel had this uh he he's already studied this one but I think it's something in the neighborhood of like a 2 and a half or something like that perc increase in conversion per second and so sometimes I've seen some of your pages you have 9 seconds 13 seconds of load time it's like if you can get that down to like 3 seconds You've Got 2 plus per time 10 uh in terms of improvement on uh conversion right if you click and it's like changing a channel on a television you're going to convert more people now um the next one is using side by-side comparisons I'm surprised that they
(1:00:24) aren't really hitting on this heavily so they talk about it really heavily in their advertising but they're not showing um what other people are doing comparatively and so this is one where like Progressive kind of pioneered this in the insurance industry where they were showing what other uh plans cover and prices Associated and I think if you are the underdog then it's okay to do that if you're the top dog you don't show anybody else's but if you're M if you're if you're making a budget as your primary sales point then using side by
(1:00:57) side makes sense because they can see the Delta one of the other things here that I think is probably worth mentioning is hidden fees one of the one of the big concerns with budget providers like budget Airlines is that they will charge you for each piece of luggage they'll charge you for drinks they'll charge you for everything it's like are they going to charge me for anything else and I think being explicit about that somewhere would probably increase conversion so if I'm them I would be looking at the same plus good stuff away from bad stuff and if you you
(1:01:26) don't work with us so selling the don't you're going to keep having bad stuff and keep not having good stuff and that's where having the justos of the other providers could prove for very good fodder for ongoing emails and so like one email would just be more good stuff next email would be less bad stuff next email would be uh if you don't do this you'll keep having bad stuff if you don't do this you'll keep not having good stuff and then each of the good stuff and bad stuff you have three vectors that you can look at across all four of those which is risk speed and
(1:01:55) ease and so showing the visual of the step-by-step process of what it takes to sign up that could de it could drisk someone's concern about how easy it is from a speed perspective I would probably hit on more points of like well how quickly can I get act activated right like could I be using my phone within a few minutes if I could I would want to know that so I would talk about speed um from a risk perspective they do they are um they do have commitments Associated and so I'd want to know what are my cancellation policies and what
(1:02:23) does cancelling look like so believe it or not if you actually just show someone how to cancel before they buy sometimes they're just more likely to buy because they're like oh I understand how I can get out of this it reverses the risk of the purchase now the big obvious one is that price is another thing that they do but I wouldn't say that's an area of opportunity I think they already hit their price pretty hard if you like these types of real business breakdowns I had a small business owner who is a stylist who flew out to Vegas to have her business broken down and improved
(1:02:46) it's the video of the year that I got the highest amount of Praise from business owners 4 who said this was the best video they had had and so I want everyone to watch it because it's really good so go check it out

Netflix's Recurring Revenue Tactics Can Scale Any Business - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video what i want to talk to you about is how we two and a half x the lifetime value of our physical products business by adding in recurring revenue for most businesses small or large adding in recurring revenue is going to be the single greatest way to increase your enterprise value and so i've been doing a really deep dive on this uh just thinking through it because i'm trying to create a checklist for my own portfolio companies um and so i just figured i would share it with you and so going through this deep dive the first
(00:27) thing i want to do is kind of challenge one of the original thoughts that i think comes up all the time is i don't have recurring revenue i'm not a recurring revenue business etc and i think that that is binary thinking which is either our recurring revenue business or you are not a recurring revenue business when in reality is to what extent are you recurring in business how recurring is your business is a better question and so what um after after thinking about it for almost a few hours this morning i was writing down in my lovely
(00:51) ipad here my ideas around recurring revenue and uh there are eight c's because i'm trying to make this you know memorable for myself too that you can implement to make your recurring revenue more sticky and so just as a quick side note or tangent on this before we dive in it doesn't matter what type of business you're in you're there's always a an extent to which you can become a more recurring revenue business so a typical example that i'll get in this instance is someone's like well i'm in real estate you know there's nothing
(01:19) recurring about my business which is so silly it just means that you have a very limited time horizon right and the question is uh one if you're a realtor you absolutely have recurring revenue business because you want to have the lifetime value of the customer and every single house they buy and sell right right even if you were selling houses for example who else is serving for recurring revenue it's not the house the bank is consistently giving you loan after loan after loan what you're really buying is a mortgage right not the house
(01:43) it's secured by the house you're getting a loan for money which is secured against the house it's not actually the house itself so to the bank and the real estate agent and the escrow company those are the companies that are generating recurring revenue from this quote single transaction right but they're hoping that you would continue to visit them over and over and over again i just wanted to make that shift for anyone if you're in the car repair business right like and you have an auto shop of course you want to have
(02:03) recurring revenue every business owner long enough time horizon is recurring if done properly right and you can either choose to make it more recurring or less recurring and so the purpose of this video is to show you how to increase the stickiness increase the recurring nature of the services and products and or access that you sell within your company all right and i'm doing this within again my own portfolio companies and so i'm doing this because i want to share these frameworks with you so the first of these and this may be you know maybe
(02:30) the most obvious is consumption right the goal uh to increase the stickiness of recurring revenue is to increase the consumption and you can think about this from a physical standpoint which you can see physical here i'll see if i have a little error i know it's a little small that's what she said deal with it but uh consumption right the goal is like if we can get someone to eat the food that we're making every single month they're going to want to buy more of it if it is good to the same degree netflix has a
(02:52) recurring revenue business and it's not like they have contracts or anything like that but it is purely based on consumption you want to continue to consume the things that they put out and so you continue to pay right and so spotify again you want to continue to consume the music and so you pay right now the cool thing is is that if we're still thinking along this binary versus continuum thinking process it is not uh you know do i get my people to consume the product but it is how well do i get people to consume the
(03:20) product right and so for each of these eight cs that i'm about to go through don't think is it a check box of yes or no but instead to what extent do i do this and the idea is not that you want to have all eight i mean it would be magical if you had all eight but if you can easily think through each of these uh c's um as ways that you can bolster or make your business more recurring uh than it was before and each of these individuals you can do better or worse so you have you have continuums within continuums and that sounds complex and
(03:49) that's why we like to use the psychological binary or shorthand of yes or no but reality is not nearly as simple all right so the first of these is how can we get someone to increase the consumption of our product and services and so that creates that means going through you know creating better onboarding experiences improving the actual value of the product itself making it more addictive in nature etc right so somebody wants to continue to consume it the second of these is collateral so is there um is there any way that we can secure our
(04:18) uh recurring revenue against something else all right so i'll give you two examples in the physical world if you go to storage they have your physical goods they have your stuff right and so you must continue to pay because they have your stuff right it's a secured uh continuity stream a different way in the digital world dropbox is storage they just have your files and they have your stuff google drive is storage right and there's different types of collateral so the idea for us as entrepreneurs is how else can we create collateral either
(04:47) physical or digital um that that makes that we can secure against this continuity so people want to continue to stay and pay a different version of this would be like a crm right crm has all of your contacts and all of those uh you know all the contacts all their information etc that they are now holding and they're holding i don't want to say hostage but they are relatively holding hostage from you so that you continue to stay right so that is a second way that we can increase the stickiness of the continuity that we are
(05:13) making the next is cost of switching all right and so this is a lot this has somewhat to do with psychology which you have the time cost sorry the time uh cost of switching which is like it might be very arduous or lots of effort uh to switch over providers of x y and z right um and or uh it might cost you a lot of money to do that and you can even further increase this psychological bias in your favor by increasing the sunk cost fallacy on your prospect so a way of doing this for example would be if i were selling a hundred dollar a month
(05:44) continuity if i told someone that they had to spend five thousand dollars one time to begin working with me and then it was 100 a month the likely that they would cancel would be significantly lower i talked about this briefly inside the 100 million offers book which is the bigger the head the longer the tail if you have a really big upfront it makes it much easier to drive the recurring on the back end and so the stickier it will be and so you can make that in terms of fees you can make that in terms of time
(06:06) money investment basically the harder is to get into something the the psychological bias against the harder it will be to get out and so the cost of switching will increase the stickiness of the recurring revenue that you have for physical products or services the next is choice all right so the idea here is the lack of choices so if i had uh if i were the only only you know xyz service provider on an island i may have a lot of stickiness to my business because there are no competitors now that may be short-lived if someone else
(06:32) sees what i am doing and then sees the opportunity right um but the idea you know patents are a way to decrease the choice that uh consumers have for alternatives right if you're the only one who owes this patent for this medical drug then they have to continue to buy from you over and over again you can argue the ethics around it but that's not the point of this channel the point of this channel is simply just showing the economics behind the business model so if there are ways that we can decrease the alternatives that someone
(06:59) can have because we have a unique competitive process or a trade secret that we have that allows us to do something differently or better than everyone else and fundamentally this is the point of differentiation in and of itself is to decrease the alternative to decrease the choices someone has if you were the absolute best at xyz there will no there might not be a choice of anyone else who can do what you can do this is also the reason that niching down is so valuable for many businesses especially if they're starting out because there
(07:23) might not be anyone else who will have their unique combination of skills resources etc to provide the value in the way that they do right and so our idea to create a stickier business to have more recurring customers to have more recurring revenue is to decrease the other alternatives right either through directly with patents uh you know indirectly by having no one else on the island or by having some sort of competitive advantage that we have that no one else has right trade secrets of some kind the fourth is control of the
(07:48) money flow this was one that i added near the end because i was thinking through it i was like what else is really sticky what else makes recurring revenue sticky and one of the ways is candidly a lack of transparency and what i mean by that is you know uh uber you know for example they're gonna take their fee before they pay you know the government takes their fee which is your taxes if you're an employee before you pay which is why most employees don't have nearly the same gripe with taxes as most business owners because the business
(08:14) owners see the checks that are coming out every month whereas many of the employees do not they just see the end result of the money i'm not saying that no employees don't have issues with taxes that's not my point here i'm just saying that if we're talking about to what extent or a degree on a continuum the more overt the charges are rather than covert uh or before someone can see it or without them seeing it then the the stickier it is because they are less noticing of the fee or charge right and again my argument here is not the ethics
(08:40) behind this it's simply that this is something that the more a business or recurring revenue stream has this nature embedded within it then the stickier it will be in general all right because again all of these are continuums within the larger continuum of how sticky or how recurring is your business not whether your business is recurring or not and so we want to take more and more steps along each of these continuum to overall bolster bolster the recurring revenue nature of our business all right the next one uh is cause all right and
(09:10) what i mean by that is are people aligned with the cause uh that we are that we are we are we are standing for so churches have recurring revenue people pay 10 they tithe towards the church right and so if people are aligned with the cause then they will continue to pay because they're getting value because they associate their identity with that cause all right uh this is why building movements within businesses are so valuable because then we can we can act and function far more like a church can in in the fact that
(09:38) people will associate their identities with the cause and continue to pay because of who they are and because of what they believe that the cause represents charity there are some people who continue to give over and over again even though the benefit that they're getting right because there is still a product of charity the product is the feeling that people get when they when they pay because they feel good about themselves and so if we have this nature within if we can embed this nature within our recurring revenue
(10:03) stream then we will make it stickier right people donate to political parties every single year that is a recurring uh commitment that many people do people continue to frequent the same brands because they believe the brand stands for something that they too believe in right and so this is kind of the more amorphous or vague part of it but still very very real in terms of how you can create stickier recurring revenue all right the next one is community all right and this one i was really really hesitant because i almost i almost put
(10:29) it in with cause but it felt different enough that i felt like i should pull it out but people continue to pay for things if they feel like they're they're becoming a part of a community and they would have to sacrifice their identity so you'll notice between cause and community um they're both related to uh the identity that someone has which is they're gonna be it's commitment and consistency they're going to they're going to continue to be consistent with what they believe to be their identity because people don't like
(10:53) to be inconsistent with who they are and so if they believe they identify as being a part of a community then they will continue to want to pay uh for that community the next one is contracts that are enforceable so by and large i'm not the biggest fan of contracts i mean obviously we lawyer up and we have all of our our legal resources and that's a necessary you know part of doing business um but uh having contracts in and of themselves can increase the stickiness i'll give you a simple example so if i said i have
(11:20) a 2 000 a month continuity whatever right and you can just pay as you go right that will probably net me if i were to have two things that were equal in value that i'm providing right two thousand dollars a month someone sign up let's say for a six month contract at two thousand dollars a month or what i would say a twelve thousand dollar program that has six payments of two thousand dollars now if i know that my recurring revenue stream as a month-to-month version uh only has let's say four months of stick if i can sell
(11:48) this as a twelve thousand dollar package the likely that i get that extra one or two months is high and so i'm saying just if two products and services are identical but we package them differently the one that is sold with a contract against a against a total value will likely be stickier because people are committing to a certain period of time and so if we have contracts that are enforced that is just one way of making a contract enforceable another way of making contract enforceable and this is somewhat a degree of collateral
(12:11) which is someone has a their credit worthy right they can ding their credit if uh if they if they breach their contract right so you do have some sort of collateral which is kind of the nature of making contract sticky is that you want to have some collateral but i felt that this was different enough especially with the example of you know charging twelve thousand dollars for uh for for six times two versus a month a month of two thousand dollars a month you may end up getting more people to pay and stay longer simply by
(12:35) positioning it as a six month agreement that then goes month to month after the six months right and so just by making that tiny change in terms of how we're positioning we might be able to increase our ltv or probably lifetime gross profit by two or three x simply by making that one change all right which is a massive improvement for a business and so just another way that you can think of how can i make my recurring revenue stickier how can i make my business more recurring i'll do a quick recap for you the eight c's of recurring
(13:00) revenue and our goal here is to think of this as a as a continuum checklist which is if i'm looking at my service how can i make it how can i how can i get people to consume more of it right how can i make it more valuable how can i make it easier to use how can i make it so people want to use this over and over and over again number one number two how can i increase the collateral that they have when they do business with me so that so that they they can't leave because i have something that is secured against it right secured against their
(13:25) recurring fee that's coming over and over again how can i increase the cost of switching so how difficult in time money or sunk cost or perceived time or perceived money can i make it so people do not want to switch next how can i enter a marketplace where there's fewer choices or how can i increase my competitive advantage by making uh trademarks i p trade secrets or continuing to assemble products so that no one else can deliver what i can deliver this is kind of the competitive mode that warren buffett talks about the
(13:50) controlling of the money flow is there a way that we can figure out how to get paid first or get paid off the top or somehow tie it so that our fees are less overt again i'm not talking about the ethics behind it i'm simply talking about the efficaciousness right the efficacy of this uh way of doing and increasing the stickiness of it next how can we create a cause that we are aligned with so people can identify with what we are which is they buy shoes from us not just for the shoes but for the cause that they identify with in addition to right
(14:20) the the classic um tom shoes example how can we increase the community not like yes i have a community check we've already got that taken care of but how many more ways can we strengthen and tie the community together so that people feel like they're leaving a community not a business which is much harder and then in so doing make our revenue stickier and then finally how can we make contracts that are enforceable part of that is going to be selling to better or higher quality prospects but also again um having something
(14:46) that that we can collateralize the contract against and even simply uh making people agree to a certain amount people are going to in general be more consistent with the commitment that they make if they say that they're going to stay for for six months you will have more people stay for six months if they at least say they're going to stay for six months even if not all of them do you'll still have more people stay than would otherwise do that now that may be harder on the sale and this is part of businesses balancing those things i hope
(15:12) this made sense for you in terms of how i think through recurring revenue in the business how we can increase the recurring nature of our business because again this is not the binary of i ever recurring versus a non-recurring business it is to what extent is my business recurring and to what extent am i checking off each of these boxes that we just went over so those are the eight c's of recurring nature uh recurring revenue as i know them put any other ones that you can think of if you think that there's something totally different
(15:34) or if you think there's examples that that that tie into any of these c's throw them in there i think it'll be a good lively discussion um if you found this valuable my name is alex from rosie i own acquisition.com we have a portfolio of companies that's 85 million a year so if you like this hit the subscribe button and i'll see you guys in the next video bye

Breaking down Rihanna’s Company (Real Tactics You Can Use) - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) Rihanna is worth $1.7 billion but the majority of that money is not from music it's from this and it's because of her companies and so today I'm going to analyze Rihanna's flre company Savage xvy and my name is Alex rosi I invest in companies I own acquisition.
(00:18) comom which is a portfolio that makes unreasonable amounts of money so be very very impressed and at the very end I'm going to be wearing all of this and so there's five things that her companies specifically Savage xvy does different that I think any business owner can model independent of whether or not you're celebrity and if you watch nothing else about this video make sure to stay for the breakdown of her actual membership offer she has like nine different bonuses that she figured out how to combine to make what would otherwise not be a recurring product into a reoccurring purchase that I thought was really clever that I think
(00:47) every business owner who sells stuff even on any kind of subscription can use so helping me out today will be my lovely assistant Savage and Fenty and let's pull up Rihanna's website okay so here we are so Rihanna looks great this is awesome and she's obviously selling tons of product through the site but the real question is how could she go from zero to global distribution overnight when she has no experience in manufacturing no experience in brick and mortar distribution and arguably probably not that much experience even in online shopping and so she did five
(01:19) things that I want to dial in on so the first thing she did was she partnered for her deficiencies right and so she has three cord deficiencies around this business so the first one is going to be distribution but I mean physical distribution she already has the media distribution she already has the brand so she has the eyeballs but how does she get the stuff how does she get the stuff into people's hands right the second is how do we create the stuff how do we actually do the manufacturing and then thirdly the internet sales side is also a completely
(01:48) different game from making music or you know social media or even to a degree design cuz I would argue that she probably has a much stronger hand in the design of the products which we'll get to in a minute the first is that she partnered with someone with an existing distribution base lvmh and so if you don't know what lvmh is lvmh uh is the holding company of Bernard Arno who's one of the top whatever 15 wealthiest people in the world he's a centa billionaire so if you haven't heard of lvmh you've certainly heard of their companies like Christian Dior Louis vuon
(02:17) javoni Hennessy and Tiffany and Co and they and they own a ton more beyond that so the first thing she did was she partnered for her deficiency now what does lvmh bring to the table that she could not otherwise have done on her own now to be clear I'm not saying that Rihanna doesn't have the ability to do this it's just that she'd have to learn a ton of skills that's probably not quarter what she's really good at right and so what things did lvmh bring to the table so first and foremost they have distribution so as much as she has the
(02:48) media distribution that's a u there you go maybe I can spell uh she has the media distribution she can get the eyeball she can get the attention she has the brand Association which we will talk about but if people want to buy from her the vast majority of people still buy lingerie in person and so even though she has an online store where she can drive people too they have physical retail experience finding locations building them out and basically helping people build a retail model when she has no retail experience the second thing that they could help her on is manufacturing right it's one thing to uh
(03:25) you know make a a product to do some Drop Shipping you know connect with some little manufacturer the thing that happens is the bigger you get the more difficult supply chain becomes and the more you need to have Partners who can handle that kind of scale and volume and here's the hard part day one right like it's more common for you to sometimes you partner with someone and they kind of grow with you with their business as your business grows but she's a super mega A-list celebrity day one and so she has access to almost like a global audience day one and so she needs
(03:59) someone with global fracturing and global distribution day one and so just put some numbers on this they have 118 factories globally and over 6,000 retail stores so they have the experience so zooming back out if you're a business owner you're like okay what I mean that's great for Rihanna what can I do with this well number one is distribution is one of those key things that you can make Partnerships for that Mak sense right like for example when I uh invested in school I brought media distribution right I had a lot of people who wanted to to start businesses or had
(04:31) businesses and wanted to build communities online and so that was something that I brought to the table and so building distribution either retail physical stores that is something that that that's an asset it makes something very valuable that you can bring to a partnership for example again when we had uh gym launch which was the company that I started and sold we had a distribution base of brick andmar gyms and so when I started Prestige Labs which was our supplement company I could sell through that BR brick-and mortar
(04:55) distribution base day one which is why that company within the first month that it's $1.7 million in sales in the first month of really being in business and so I I I bring that up to say that like there are few things more valuable than building distribution and so the third one to tie this off is that they had retail and online sales experience right so they they know how to build out the online presence for all all the brands they have under lvmh and they are probably have teams upon teams of Specialists who
(05:28) know how to run direct response ads who know run branding campaigns that have PR Specialists that can go and get her in the right places at the right times all of that stuff and so the big takeaway for me and potentially you and this is something that took me too long to learn is that I think in the earlier part of my career I wanted to learn everything and I think that's very valuable but at some point I believe that businesses are limited by the collective brain power so these are my little brains there we go that are inside of an organization and so if you're the only brain in the
(05:58) organization because you have taught everything you know to every other person then it means that a business is limited on one person's Lifetime and I don't care how smart you are I mean if you're Elon then you you know congratulations you're an alien and and have have beat everyone but for us mere mortals we usually need to get other people in their lifetime of learning and put it all together so that overall we can create a bigger Enterprise and the best people in the world don't do it for free and to give you some scale here her laundry brand
(06:29) alone did over $100 million in sales now it's like how do we know what numbers they're not super public about the numbers and so but I think big picture we can just say they make lots of money what can we learn so number two is she picked a good market now if you've read the book $100 million offers I talk about this before I even get into the offer because your Market is more important than anything else to give you an extreme example if you were selling toilet paper during covid you didn't need to have an amazing offer if you just had toilet paper you had what a
(07:00) starving crowd right on the flip side if you were trying to sell marketing services and you're the best marketing services in the world you're trying to sell it to newspapers that are paper newspapers those things are going down no matter what right and so the first thing that's going to be the biggest lever on the success of the business is who you actually serve to now the vast majority of markets are neither of those extremes they're not dying every day 25% compounded inally in the wrong direction
(07:23) or absolute Supply demand uh discrepancy between the entire world trying to buy toilet paper right most markets I would just consider our normal markets now what she did that was unique and so I'll put it in here I'll pull this up from the book is that there are four components to a market that I like is are they in pain do they have the purchasing power are they easy to Target and are they growing and so let's run through the market that Rihanna selected for her Avatar through this framework so first and foremost were they in pain the
(07:56) answer is yes and she actually followed a rule that I really love when it comes to product is that you want to have lived with the pain of what you're solving typically for a long period of time now Rihanna is a uh uh she comes from mixed ethnicity she has mixed parents she has a very diverse background and I think as a result of that she also has a very diverse audience and so one of the issues that she found is that lingerie and undergarments uh the nude colors were not actually matching the vast majority of skin tones so they had a hand they had one nude but it didn't match
(08:26) basically anyone and so she had a novel idea which is number one is that she offered 40 different shades of nude underwear and so to quote her she said there needs to be something for a dark skinned girl there needs to be something for a really pale girl and there needs to be something in between right and so that became the foundation of Savage X fenty's entire business model and so this then laded up to their overall brand approach which is aligned with Rihanna which was about inclusivity and body positivity now part of that is because this was a unique carve out from
(08:56) the traditional uh industry standards not to say that those are right wrong it's just they were different right and the other piece of this is that her personally we've seen her kind of weight Journey over time and so there's been like thicker Rihanna and then there's been thinner Rihanna and so in either of some situations and obviously there's people who are you know like I like like Rihanna I like the skinny Rihanna whatever the point is is that she has gone through this experience she resonates with the pain and her audience knows that it's authentic when she tries to solve that problem and so the second
(09:24) thing that you want is purchasing power now she had a very difficult decision to make here right lvmh is a luxury brand so this is a this is a company that's known for selling bags for 5,000$ 10,000 $50,000 and sometimes they don't even put the price on their sites because it's so expensive and they ship out one or two products two physical locations which just to keep the scarcity so high now meanwhile let's pull up our site let's see if we can make sure that we don't get banned from YouTube for uh for softcore um look at the prices on these
(09:54) These are super reasonable prices $5 for g strings uh I mean actually I'm not really a purchaser of G-strings but I imagine that's not super expensive $25 12 for 2 for30 you know uh $5 accessories $10 bras $15 Sports Styles $20 Lounge Styles $3 underwear right so there's there's a lot of very affordable stuff on her site and so for that what she saw for the purchasing power for very large audience was she just made it affordable right and I think that was a good brand move for her given her uh upringing where she came from and kind of like I think it was on brand it was
(10:29) was the right move for her so first off did she have pain yes and she lived with that pain and she knew her audience did too so she made the 40 colors next is did she make it price so that the vast majority of audience could buy it yes her audience was everyone so she had to make it affordable for everyone now the next thing is was it easy to find now this is one of the big things that she brought to the table with her distribution she was able to overnight have the world find out about this brand which is an advantage that most people don't have and so she just she just did a casual overnight 20year career to
(10:59) build her brand so yeah it was overnight naturally but she was able to easily find the audience because she already had them within her community and then finally is this a growing market right and so this is a company that is serving an audience of people that's very diverse they have posit body positivity at least in the US people are getting more of a weight every year and so there's lots of people who feel disenfranchised with the beauty industry now there's a little bit of pendum swing back there fine but buy and L L I think that uh we can just look at the
(11:32) projected value of her Market segment and it's growing at a 5% kager right which is basically compounded annual growth rate and so not like she has a lot of Market to go after and the market itself is growing because she's a smart businesswoman lingerie is maybe an80 billion market right at least in 2025 or projected to be but active wear is just under 600 billion all right and that has a 23% annual ized growth rate compounded all right so like this thing so at 23.
(12:04) 5% just to give you context that's doubling every 4ish years all right like very fast so like that means that if you stayed in the same exact percentage of the market that you have that means that your company would double automatically in that same period of time and so this shows the advantage of having a Tailwind versus a headwind like just keeping up with the growth of the marketplace your business doubles not a bad gig and so for her boom she checks off the having a growing market and so when we're picking what industries we're going to go in
(12:32) what adars we're going to serve it's like cool let's make sure that we're going after a clear pain Point that's not being served do they have the ability to pay for what we have can we find them easily and are they likely to continue to get bigger or smaller over time when you ever have a kind of a significant Innovation then you're going to have people who follow right and I'll give you a completely different example uh Sarah Blakeley recently just launched sneaks which is basically like high heels that are sneakers and so her whole thing has been how do I exploit
(13:01) industries that have not made Comfort a standard but are still in Beauty there's going to be a large increase in these high heel sneakers because women want to be comfortable but also want the inches and right now it's underserved and so finding that pain and this is also again like Sarah like just like Rihanna a pain that she had lived with for years so the third big thing that she did exceptionally well was her brand now you're like okay well what is what does that mean with regards to this well she is a mom she's had the change in weight
(13:35) she has different body types and different skin color kind of like herself she's kind of mixed and so because of that it made sense for her to kind of do this brand now big picture what I want to highlight here is why would someone care about buying her stuff versus what they already are currently purchasing so she has this massive audience of people that have positive Affinity towards her positive sentiment they like her songs they like her lifestyle they identify with her she's aspirational so if you've got two bras that you're looking at right two products and one of them is just from a
(14:07) brand that you have no real Affinity towards and the other is one where you have this you're a fan of the person and their and their price the same and the quality is the same which one you going to go with you're going to switch from the one that you have no real Affinity towards to the one that you do and so she capitalized on that and so one what's happening in a lot of a lot of markets is that there are a lot of old corporate brands that don't have personel or have lacked personality lacked Champions and so they've made room for people to come in with a large
(14:36) audience and who have stronger Affinity to then create their own brands with equivalent products uh in terms of quality and design and upset the market really quickly like you're seeing this with Mr Beast and his chocolate bars versus Hershey and I'll say let me give you an example of a brand that's doing this really well in my opinion Nike has been able to stay iconic because they actually leverage personal Brands better than almost anyone else else and so it's like well who's like if LeBron wanted to
(15:02) start his own you know line it's like he could but he just went straight to Nike because if you want to compete with Nike you're not just competing with Nike you're competing with LeBron you're competing with tiger for the the the peak of his career you're competing with you know huge teams I should probably name more people that are associated with Nike but all the greats many of them have signed with Nike so it's like you're not just competing with Nike you're competing with all of their legacies so Rihanna came up with this
(15:27) this this bra that because she is a mother and she wanted to make it easier for nursing she wanted to have a bra that helped her do that and so she made a bra that did that and that bra she made cheaper with a membership which I'll talk about in a second but I think the the underlying thought process here is what can I do to make my product faster for people easier for people or more risk-free right and so these are the the vectors of value creation right and I talk about this in the offers book at length it's probably one of the Core Concepts within the book which I refer
(15:58) to as the value equation which is the dream outcome for them is that they want to look sexy they want to feel confident and maybe even relate maybe just a fraction of how Rihanna feels they're like she's cool she's amazing she's Savage she's ferocious right I want to feel like a baddie like her right and then perceive likelihood of achievement well you know what this actually fits me it's actually my skin color this decreases the risk around feeling dumb feeling stupid when you put something on and it's way too small or whatever right and then time delay and effort and
(16:28) sacrifice these are the things like how do we make it easier so she made the clasp easier and then uh she made them more comfortable and then time delay that's going to be more on the logistics of shipping for this type of product compared to maybe a service or something like that and I'm going to talk about how she hammered the value equation in her membership model which she did a number of unique things that I think a lot of people could copy uh who are watching this right now badir Riri uh made her launch campaign and she followed the clear textbook whisper tease shout method and so she did a
(16:57) whisper Campaign which was where she had this kind of mysterious post right where she had Savage xvy which was at that time a mysterious account that she followed it was the only thing she followed and then overnight it got all of this press because it was the only thing she followed and it got all of these followers virtually overnight like 177,000 followers in 24 hours with zero content on the page think about what what the whisper phase is right so it call outs it's like an ad the co the key phase here is curiosity right and so this is keep the product itself mysterious and hint at how big of a deal
(17:27) it is but keep wiers short and bonus points if you can show behind the scenes now this then transitions into where she's going for tease right so this is where she then teases the upcoming launch and she starts to fuel excitement so people are starting to guess what is this about now I think people had a decent idea of what this what this launch was going to be when she made the te's right and so now people like the anticipation begins to build and then finally she transitions to the shout phase which is basically giving people
(17:56) the call to action yes it's live go buy it now Savage X venty and she made it available to her you know hundreds of millions of of followers across all platforms and I want to I want to talk about something else that she did really really well that I think a lot of us business owners can model so one of the things that Rihanna does exceptionally well is she makes organic content right and one of the key Parts is that she makes her organic content contextual to the platform so if you look here one of the steps in making content that I have inside of the book 100 million doll leads right is that like this is you
(18:25) know the the Old Linkedin Facebook Instagram Tinder meme is that you can't walk into a party I think Gary has a great analogy you can't walk into a party uh dressed in a tuxedo when you're going to a club like it looks weird it's out of place even though that tux there's nothing wrong you look like James Bond you look great it might be out of place there now nowadays maybe you'd be you know people would think it looks really cool because I think it would look kind of cool but you get the idea right now she has uh a huge
(18:50) following on Instagram huge following on Tik Tok huge following on YouTube and she makes the the content uh platform specific and so there's very little crossover between her Instagram content her Tik Tok content her YouTube content and her Tik Tok content YouTube and Instagram and so she makes it platform specific so she's very clever marketer uh because she understands how the platforms work and makes platform native content and so here's more or less how she breaks down on Instagram she does a lot more high-fi stuff it's a lot more aesthetic and so she'll do more image-based stuff uh and she'll share
(19:21) photos and you know models kind of showcasing the lingerie now the only behind the scenes material is probably going to just be her stories all right now Tik Tok is short short form videos right and so there she's showcasing products a little bit more um and she has kind of hops on more trending sounds and challenges uh and she's a lot more collaborations with other creators and because of Tik Tok shop it's easier for her to have direct purchases right on platform and then finally with YouTube she's using more long form strategy she
(19:46) so more try on hauls reviews promotes her VIP membership which I'll talk about in a second which I think is one of the more clever things that she's done here that I think a lot of businesses will copy that you can too and so if your cous all of this is branding all right so with the exception of her making you know direct ass letting people know about the products that they can buy if you just demonstrate the use of the product if you demonstrate expertise if you're in in a in a B2B or Services business demonstration in a lot of ways makes the association between you and uh
(20:17) the positive sentiment that you want and if you do that over and over again that is what can take a high information buyer somebody who needs a lot of information before making decision which is the vast majority of the marketplace and then convert them into a customer now number four the next thing she did is she doubled down on Affiliates really hard and I'm a huge fan of Affiliates uh Allen my software company was built uh entirely off of Affiliates Prestige Labs was built off of a distribution base of
(20:41) Affiliates of gym owners and so I'm a huge advocate for Affiliates school is 65% uh affiliate traffic in terms of the the percentage of the people who are on school it's people from school who refer other people to school right and so I'm a huge huge advocate of this because fundamentally Affiliates compound right and they become these permanent nodes of distribution for for you and so obviously there's basically two levels of Leverage that she was able to achieve with this business first she was able to leverage lvmh's retail distribution base
(21:07) so that's the physical presence and then layered on top of that she was able to Leverage The aggregated Following of many mega stars and what I think is really unique about her affiliate strategy is that you'll notice the different look and feel of the Affiliates I'll name them in a second but like they represent different Beauty ideals and so I think they were very deliberate about who they chose so they have people like the hadit sister gigg and Bella Hadid they had Emily radch Kowski I don't know how to say her name but like very pretty lady but different
(21:35) look they had Norman right again different look lizo different body type right Vanessa hudgin Cindy Crawford Demi Moore and so lots of different looking feels uh to attract a wider audience and I think the common theme between all of those is that they're considered beautiful this is something that's actually taking me a long time to learn is that the Affiliates that you choose have a huge influence and the reason and I wrote this on the same page is a huge influence on your brand it's a bir directional relationship your brand influences who's attracted to the brand
(22:07) who wants to affiliate it and then those Affiliates then reinforce the brand itself of what are we about right what are the associations people make with our products and services and the things they no like can trust all right she followed the affiliate Playbook says chapter inside of $100 million leads uh to a so she found her ideal Affiliates we just covered that now she made them an offer now some of them is sponsor ship some of them they get a SP sponsorship and a percentage of Revenue I would imagine that for the vast majority of these types of deals they're probably almost all just cash
(22:36) sponsorships that they they make a certain amount of post every year where they're repping it and they're wearing it and I think at this level I would hope the vast majority of them it was on brand for them as personal influencers to make the association with Rihanna and lvmh because lvmh has an amazing brand too right um now obviously the qualification they were already Superstars uh we already covered how to pay them get them to advertise that what posting Cadence what things we want them to wear right and so we have to think about the value equation also for Affiliates and I think this is one of
(23:06) the most misunderstood part people think they like oh I'm going to have an affiliate program people just automatically promote my stuff that just basically never happens Affiliates basically become another tier of customer for you and you have to make an offer so good they feel stupid saying no just like you would for a customer and so it's like how do I make it easier for them so she sent them banners links uh promotional materials so that it kind of made it turn key for them so they didn't have to you know take a lot of time to
(23:29) to think about how they're going to promote it and she could actually make sure that their promotions were still on brand and so to reinforce her Affiliates positions as Premiere right in terms of aspirational uh Savage xvent has a fashion show that actually won an Emmy that was on Amazon Prime and she invited some of those Mega influencers to come and join her to kind of rep it and so this is brand a creative it's brand it's brand additive to them so this is like the perfect brand deal is one where both
(23:58) part parties benefit from one another and both Brands go stronger and have more positive sentiment across a wider distribution base than they did prior to the deal because then there's zero cost to the deal there's added Financial value but there's also increased Goodwill and distribution right like that's those are the good types of deals and fundamentally I think that's what she was able to achieve so I'm going to flash up some stats so Instagram actually did a breakdown of this campaign of how they were advertising across uh social media and rather than
(24:29) read you all these stats I'm going to give you the the bottom line which is that most direct response marketers it takes everybody a different amount of time to figure this out but let's say this is the world of potential buyers that you have well about this many of them are ready to buy today so this is the classic if you've never heard this sta before it's 97% of people are not ready to buy today and 3% are right and so most direct response marketers are all fighting making better and better offers to this tiny little dot but the clever
(25:02) marketers who understand the longer game is that this 97% you move along the Continuum to hear through brand awareness through brand education and positive associations and so there's no mistake that they did a lot of topop funnel awareness a lot of associations a lot of narrative a lot of aesthetic storytelling pairing associations that they deemed quality to their demographic graphic so that when they did make an offer to them they had moved them along this Continuum into their now much larger bucket that everyone else has a 3% bucket they're competing for and
(25:38) maybe they're at a 15% bucket that's five times big that looks like a three there you that's a five um and so fundamentally this is how Brands always beat businesses that are purely direct response you look at the biggest companies in the world they're not like they're not they're not Arbitrage businesses they're not like I can buy a click for a penny and I can and I can sell it for two the thing is is that brand advertising outperforms direct response advertising every time as long as you know what you're doing caveat on a long enough time rizon and so in a in
(26:10) in 30 days direct response will probably be branding but on a year branding will smash it and that's where you get those 20x 50x sometimes 100x Returns on advertising dollars it happens when you when you grow the pie and then no one else can compete against you because all of this extra that we grew with the brand awareness is only extra for you and everyone else is still competing for this little Dot and you don't even need to advertise that little dot because you've got this massive pie right here that you grew organically with Goodwill
(26:39) with positive sentiment by the way the reason I make these videos this is all branding the whole point here is that hopefully you can learn some nugget that you can apply to your business and then as a result make more money and Associate that making more money with me and she did this this growing of the pie overnight over 20 years right of having more like Platinum hits than almost any any musician today um and maintaining a very kind of cool badir uh brand I ranked these in order of what I would deem important St you're like how could distribution from lvmh for partnership be more important well if she didn't have them she wouldn't
(27:15) have a business right she wouldn't be able to manufacture products she wouldn't be able to keep up with the demand she wouldn't have the brick-and mortar distribution that she has she wouldn't even have the necessarily the brand Association of of Premium luxury goods all of those things were massively beneficial right the second thing is that she picked the right Market if she had picked the wrong Market to begin with for example I think if she had gone luxury I think that would have been really bad I think people would have been like she's being ridiculous she's so greedy she's which which is hilarious
(27:40) uh that she's so greedy really she just made more money doing it this way just because she was being smart it would have just been a bad move given her brand now for example like we do huge you know very big deals in terms of what we do so it makes sense for anything that I would eventually sell to be expensive right it makes sense so second like I said if you don't have a good Market that you're going after it's going to fall in flat ears if she had done a big luxury move and gone like $5,000 $10,000 St I think it would have
(28:06) been a disaster right so she picked the right market and she was clever about the fact that not only did she go after Ling Ray she also went into into Athletics stuff right well this is loungewear but the idea is that those are growing at disproportionate faster than population growth and GDP growth she's going into growing markets she's going into drinking she wouldn't have sold anything to begin with third then when you have the growing Market you have the distribution brand allows you to capitalize on it that allows you to get people to switch from what they're currently buying to your thing because
(28:33) they have brand Affinity because of the 20 years of Goodwill that she's built up from the music that people associate with going out from having fun from just relaxing from in their drives all of that positive sentiment built up over years then gets monetized flipped when she starts presenting real products now when she has that then it's like how do I get leverage on that because if she had just done that she would have made plenty of money but how do I get more leverage fourth she brings in the Affiliates now she gets even more
(28:58) leverage on the distribution in terms of media by also getting more inclusion because of different skin types color types Beauty Aesthetics Beauty ideals so she can capture a wider percentage of the marketplace and then finally number five now we talk about the offer all right and so this is in order of importance all right so she had what I would consider a grand slam membership offer because she could have had just a generic offer and I think it probably would have done fine but she did a couple unique things that I think are really worth uh dialing in on now there
(29:28) were some technical components that required her to do this and um she did get a little bit of dings from uh from Regulators but I will I will talk about that briefly so let's look at the core components of her membership and so there's kind of Three core components here one is so remember the grand slim offer right so you have you want something that's going to be uh easy you want it to be be fast you want it to be low risk all right and then you want it to have the dream outcome all right and so each of these elements of value are actually woven into this membership so it's not just a normal membership where
(29:58) you just uh you know like a like a a box subscription right you you pay 50 bucks a month and you get a box of stuff every month that I think would have not done very well and probably would have had a tremendous amount of churn now the amount of members they have on this the sources are kind of varied my guess is she's probably got over a million people on this thing making it easy easy and fast to join so they do it right at checkout that's not necessarily unique but what I think they did make that
(30:23) unique is that anybody who buys basically buys into not only a discount Club so you save money immediately by joining the club so thing one so let's just let's outline these things so she gives a discount for being the membership is this unique not really there's plenty of discount memberships that exist now number two getting a little bit more unique she also includes VIP benefits that are media related okay so she provides behind the scenes fashion shows access exclusive content that she has inside of an app her VIP extra app
(31:01) um where she shows this stuff so people feel more connected to the movement that she's trying to build with Savage X fenny really clever so this is a a brilliant kind of combination of the physical products world and the digital Community World which is something that I'm I'm all in on when it comes to like school right school one of the big reasons I made the investment is because there's so many businesses that benefit from it right like if you're an e-commerce business you should have a community for all of your customers to
(31:24) be in cuz guess what happens there they buy more often they refer more friends they give you feedback back on the products so that you have more insight and Intel so that you know what your next product should be or how to make 2.
(31:36) 0 versions of it to make them even better all of that stuff and the nice thing is you can offer it for free right and the crazy thing is is you'd pay for the Intel that you get from a community but here you actually you're you're going to just convert more people into it so it's awesome all right now here's one of the most clever things she did um I I I I think I think it was I think this is the the best part of of this membership is it's skippable all right so what does that mean so remember I said you have to have easy fast low risk now the low risk has multiple components to this so one risk is that I don't get something that I want right that's a big
(32:08) risk um and that has two components one is paying for something that I don't want or that there's just nothing available that I don't want uh she handles the first one with having the different colors the different designs and so that one's kind of handled but in terms of okay what's in my box that I get every month well what they do is they actually personalize the recommendations per person person monthly all right so these are all personalized based on your shopping Behavior so once you make your first purchase and you join the the community
(32:35) you join the membership they then tailor the recommendations for the box for you every month based on those past purchases all right so this makes it more likely lower risk that you're going to get what you actually want but let's say that you see this box of stuff and you're like well I don't want any of this stuff well she made it skippable and so think about it like this for the first four days of every month they say hey here's the stuff that you can buy here's the stuff that's that's catered to you and you can say you know what I don't want it this month and it just skips the billing and so you actually
(33:05) just get basically the opportunity to get stuff at a cheaper price and you don't have to even pay to do it you just stay in it and so it's almost like being locked into a free in someways dis membership and then when you choose to buy something and if you assume you would be buying stuff anyways which is what this kind of capitalizes on then the months that you want to buy something you can and with the credit and so this is here's e it's based on a credit system so when you actually buy the subscription doesn't necessarily send you something
(33:34) in the Box they give you a credit that you can then redeem and pick and choose the pieces that you want which also means that let's say you uh get a $60 credit which is the price point that she has if you want to buy a $75 thing you just pay 15 bucks a checkout and worst case scenario let's say that uh you don't want to buy anything that month well next month you're going to have 60 plus 60 so you have $120 that you can spend and so in some ways it almost acts as lay way for some people to almost be like a savings program where they can
(34:01) save up for a special occasion and then Splurge with the discount that's already locked in and so I think this combination of skippable and personalized plus the credit I think this is a really really compelling combination that has led to the success of the membership offer these are the big ones but let's talk about other risk things well one they have a 90day fit uh guarantee so that gives so again risk it decreases risk even further right so you're like okay well I want to pay less and have more time to return stuff that
(34:31) makes sense they also get Early Access all right so that's closer to the approximated dream outcome right if we're talking about the four values right so like okay now I get to see this stuff earlier you also get a free annual gift so that's more bonuses right during your birthday month right when people are at the height of their emotional peak of like wanting to feel special they make them feel special and they associate that feeling with the brand brilliant move all right on top of that they have free shipping on all $59 Plus
(34:58) ERS meaning anybody who redeems their credit gets free shipping on whatever they buy right so this encourages more people to of course use the membership and they get up to 25% off so it's pretty significant discounts and that's year round right and they get 15% discounts on skin which is a different company overall that's when you start being able to cross pollinate by different different companies which is just a brilliant move on her part so look at all these benefits this is what you might consider a bonus stack if you will um just done in a physical product space and on top of that if if you but
(35:26) wait there's more right she also has a free underwear pick or bra after every fifth billing now why do you think they did it after every fifth billing because they probably know where their average turn is and so they probably have delayed a bonus past the average Turn Point to give someone immediate reward for staying longer and so then they summarize this on one place which makes it a super Grand Slam offer which is why I wanted to make this video because the the amount of people are like man I I read the offers book and I just don't know how I can apply to an e-commerce
(35:57) business this is how you apply to an e-commerce business right and of course they make cancelling easy uh so you can go there you can call them um and uh you can cancel obviously online and so the core membership offer she presents is $59.95 a month and it's credit-based and so now let's lock into what are the specific extra bonuses that she does to make this a grand slam offer not just a traditional membership so if you're wondering okay well beyond the first purchase how is she getting these personalizations a brilliant lead magnet so if you don't know what a lead magnet is I covered in
(36:31) the book $100 million leads and so if you want to get more traffic to convert give them something very valuable for free now the point here is that let's say that you just said hey go buy My Thing versus hey try a free thing and then once they get value from the free thing then asking the people got the value to then buy the thing you will get way more people to ultimately buy and so this is kind of a little visual that I have to explain the difference like you might have a 100 people that you talk to you get one sale versus low trust
(36:59) turning them into a high trust audience and then getting three times the sales right which is super common all right and so there's different types of lead magnets now for hers she's using type number one which is revealing a problem and so when you reveal a problem it's doing it through personalization so you can watch as we walk through this and so she's able to personalize recommendations not only based on what they buy but she can also change the shopping experience based on what people already say they want or likee and so at the end of this personalization obviously they have to to tie it to a
(37:28) contact so after you go through this so you have sunk cost bias right you have consistency and commitment bias so you've already gone through this and you're like oh shoot I might as well make an account and she still gives you a cookie for doing it which is that she gives you a discount code as soon as you sign up for it and so you can do this in any business so for example for acquisition.
(37:45) for business owners uh we have a scaling road map so it it gives you a personalized road map of whatever stage of scaling you're at between 0 and 500 employees and we broke it into 10 stages across eight functions so it's like what do you need to do for sales when you're going from 50 to 99 employees what do you need to do for marketing what do you need to do for customer success what do you need to do for product what do you need do for it what do you need for recruiting what do you need to finance what do you need for HR right for each of these functions what's the problem and what's the
(38:08) solution at each stage right and it's very different going from five to nine employees uh versus going from you know 50 to 100 right so you want to be as personalized in your deliveries as possible and so if you want to check our version out you can go to acis.com roadmap that being said the point of this type of lead magn which I'm obviously a fan of is revealing the problem then you then have your delivery mechanism for what that lead magic is going to be now for her she uses information as the thing that she's
(38:38) basically doing so the for her the lead magnet then turns into physical basically informs uh the physical products that she's going to offer right that's fundamentally the issue now I guess you could have a discount I don't normally consider uh discounts as a lead magnet I kind of see that as a component of an offer um but yeah fundamentally that's how it works and guys don't be afraid of asking for more look at this this this is Step eight of eight right like if you need more information to make something more valuable for someone ask for it right like a lot of people have this fear of like oh my conversion
(39:07) rate is going to go down it's like yeah but conversion rate of whom right like of people who really want to buy the thing like they probably will finish it now to be clear there's good friction and bad friction like you don't want to make the the user experience clunky but if fundamentally you need the information so that you can give them more value then ask for it like we ask for more information about the business so that we can make a personalized road map for you which we have some automation cool stuff in the background that delivers the stuff that you need at your particular stage in business and so
(39:31) there's more than like hey just your name and phone number right it's personalized so one of the really clever things that credit-based memberships have is that they basically function like gift cards and I'm a huge fan of gift cards for a variety of reasons the biggest one being it's basically getting a interest free loan from your customers all right and so whenever someone you know signs up for a gift card they basically front you money and you haven't done anything yet right so from a cash flow cycle it's a it's the most
(39:56) accelerated cash flow possible they pay you and you don't have to do anything right and so the idea is one you have faster cash flow which is good second some percentage of people are not going to necessarily redeem it and so that becomes pure profit right because the way that hers is written it's not redeemable for cash in any way all right now I think one of the the the unique components of her membership offer really smart because lingerie in of itself right not as recurring of a purchase like if you were if I were to
(40:28) say hey name me a membership type you probably the first thing that came to mind probably wasn't going to be lingre it pro if anything that just when I think lre I think special occasion right which by its very nature is going to be intermittent not recurring on a regular basis right otherwise it wouldn't be a special occasion just be an everyday occasion right and so it's like how do you get people to consistently buy from you well the discount is a huge part because they figured that over the year they're going to buy number one number two they can choose to not purchase
(40:54) anything the whole year and so they can just choose to execute their credit only on the months they do have special occasions but at least it keeps it top of mind and I would imagine that many women her target audience um like shopping and it's almost like window shopping done digitally where they say hey here's a bunch of stuff that we think you might like and some people just enjoy window shopping I mean it's a it's a it's a it's something that women do on a regular basis or people do on a regular basis in real life and they do the same thing online people browse and they don't buy anything because they still get some DOP mean or whatever it
(41:27) is that re forces them from looking next thing that she's really gone all in on with this membership is that it's she she almost makes it hard to not buy the membership um and so you can look here at her purchase page so first off the button says member add to bag it doesn't say buy it doesn't say guest check out it says member add to bag and you can see the the breakdown too where she has kind of like a a double price drop right so you've got guest purchase which is almost gray out right you can even see
(41:52) they they they changed the pixel so it's a little bit um it's like good better best right and so the worst here is you know guest is $12.95 right then member is $9.95 but for you because you're brand new and we're I'm I'm obviously not a a g string uh painting collector um maybe I am who never know my my other my other life um but it's uh it's $518 so you see this tremendous price drop so 60% off and if someone's like well shoot I'd rather do that and then when you find out oh you can just apply that today and never have to pay again because you skip
(42:28) functionally every other purchase that becomes a very attractive offer but you have to cancel in a month right well you could cancel whenever you want but you probably only be reminded to cancel in a month but at that point they'll present you new stuff and so if you have a membership offer I think making that your primary offer and then basically downselling the premium is one way of doing it that obviously has worked very well for her and I will mention this just because I think it's an obvious one
(42:50) having thirdparty financing is is is very uh you'll just make more money so if you don't have that integrated to your site especially if you're doing physical products uh you're typically losing somewhere in the neighborhood of 30% of your sales and so to summarize my rating and critique for this business I rate this a baddy business out of 10 and if you want me to break down or critique another business and run through the models that we teach acquisition.
(43:16) put it below and I'll put it in one in my in my lineup for next businesses

The 4 RAREST skills on earth that make BILLIONAIRES... - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video i'm going to walk you through the four scarcest highest value skills that exist on earth it is the cornerstone upon which every single top 100 or even top 50 billionaire has built their wealth before i dive in just as heads up if you're new to the channel my name is alex shimozzi i own acquisition.
(00:19) com it's a portfolio of companies that has about 85 million dollars a year all right the reason i make this channel so a lot of people are broke and i don't want to be one of them let's dive in before we get into each of the four skills all right an important distinction i need to make here is that when i'm saying these are the scarcest skills it is because of two major things one is that the assumption is that we are doing these skills at maximal scale all right number one and number two is that these are not binary
(00:43) skills it's not i have it or i don't have it but it's to what extent do i have it or to what degree do i have it how masterful am i in this skill and so these are the four skills that exist and you will see a clear corollary between the four ways to create leverage so the first and easiest one for everyone to understand and that's why i'm going to start with it is the ability to raise and multiply money which means you have the skill of getting money from other people and you can allocate that money in a way that it multiplies at a higher
(01:16) rate than anything else right if you have that skill you can create endless unlimited fortunes and again at scale which means you can get lots of money and you have and you can handle mass massive sums of money and you can multiply it because of how good you are at the skill so that is scarcest high value skill number one these are not in order these are just the top four any of these four if you have them can build you to a billion dollars plus number two is the ability to capture and multiply attention all right and so
(01:53) think about a joe rogan for example right he's able to build this this empire that he has because he's able to capture attention and multiply attention which is a function of media mark zuckerberg he was able to capture attention get people to look at his app and then tell their friends multiply attention and so the ability to capture and multiply attention is the second scarce and high value skill that exists so right now if you're not making the money that you want to make or you were poor it's because you're usually not
(02:23) allocating your time to the highest value scarcest skills that exist and oftentimes these skills are not skills that can be taught but there are skills that can be learned which is a quote that i got from the vol ravicon which i like a lot and oftentimes you'll note that it's not just one component of this it's not just being able to raise money it's being able to also allocate it and multiply it it's not being able to just capture attention you have to be able to use that attention to then multiply the attention on its own organically at no
(02:50) incremental cost that's the key point is that you have to be able to multiply it at no incremental cost to you that's how you get unlimited leverage number three and this is one that a lot of people are gonna trip up so i'm gonna probably say this a couple different ways the ability to return time to other people at no incremental cost to yourself at scale so for example if i can save everyone on planet earth 10 minutes every day i will be a billionaire think about that and so the way to deconstruct that is to think what is
(03:21) something that lots of people spend time on is there a way that i can automate this and again zero incremental cost which means this is often going to be some sort of technology or software solution no incremental cost to me which means that if i build this thing one time i can save everyone time forever that is a way to build a fortune that is a way to build billions and billions of dollars of wealth that is scarce high value skill number three so you can return time to other people you can decrease the effort and sacrifice that they
(03:57) experience in their lives that they do not want to experience and because it's at no incremental cost you can sell that thing to everyone because everyone will pay something for their time now the amount may be made you know widely varied but if it costs you almost nothing you can capture an entire marketplace by giving them time back what did google do gave everyone time back now they obviously multipl they they monetize through advertising but everyone was looking for something normally it would take longer to look for something and
(04:28) then they consolidated in one place they saved everyone time the fourth high value scarcest skill on planet earth is to be able to influence the behavior of others at mass scale at no incremental cost to you so you look at someone like jesus or any prophet i'm not saying he's a prophet that's not my point here my point is if you look at the mass leaders probably shouldn't even brought it up otherwise people get triggered point is is that there are people who have walked this earth thomas jefferson you know what i mean
(05:02) people who have had massive influence over other people and and their subsequent behaviors they take as a result and so this is the ability to change people's minds if you can help people change their beliefs and change their thoughts you will change the way they behave which is why when people come to a new faith all of a sudden you see this massive change in behavior it's because the operating system and the lenses through which they see the world the perspectives that they weigh their judgments using have shifted and so if you change the
(05:37) decision making calculus you change all of the downstream behaviors that happen as a result and if you can do this in concert at scale you can a change the world but b you can also make a ton of money if you look at the the best persuaders of our era they're ones who for them i would argue aggregated power because some people at a certain point you run out of needs for money you start looking for power and so if you have the ability to massively influence other people at scale at no incremental cost to you you have
(06:11) the fourth scarce high value roi skill that exists so right now bossy nation what it do if you're looking for ways to increase your wealth you can see that all four of these things are are corollary to the four types of leverage that exist these are how fortunes are created leverage number one is on labor and actions on on on behalf of other people towards your goals so other people do stuff for you that was the fourth one the one i just mentioned all right that's around labor work and basically actions other people
(06:48) take when i talked about money multiplying right that is leverage using capital so the ability to maximally raise and multiply capital at scale is a high value skill the third is being able to give people their time back what we're talking about this is a good friend of mine who's a technologist he says all technology automates luxury and luxury is typically a function of convenience effort and sacrifice and so we look at the places where people spend time and spend effort and sacrifice and we return it back to them at no criminal
(07:23) cost that is how you create scale using technology right and the key resource we're giving people back is time and then the fourth and final one is media all right and so using media and being able to multiply uh media via the capturing and multiplication of attention because ultimately media is just the substrate through which impressions are conveyed to other people signals that they are interpreting through their senses the idea is how can we capture as many senses as we can and then get those senses to get other
(07:57) people plugged into our thing and then in so doing it will compound and so one of the key notes to note about each of these four things that i just mentioned is that each of these skills compound they are not multiplicative they are not additive they are not incremental they are compounding which means they are exponential in nature a lot of people say it's an exponential growth they don't even know what exponential means but it means that it multiplies unto itself and then each time it multiplies itself bigger upon itself not just like
(08:27) we we 2x every year but it would have to be when we incrementally go 10 10 10 growth that is where is compounding and each of these in the form of labor people are influenced people tell other people people tell other people they do the thing for you and it compounds with capital the money that you multiply gets you more money which you then multiply it compounds the time you save people more time which then gets you more people to save time for and it compounds with attention you capture the attention you multiply the attempt because those
(09:00) people tell other people and then the intention comes back and so each of these are quadratic in nature in terms of the skills and those my friends are where you focus your time if you want to create a fortune and so you can look at your skill set right now and say which of these skills do i lack or which of these four buckets do am i currently at least working somewhat directly towards and then we can again think this is not a binary checklist if i have the skill or i do not have the skill but to what degree to what extent am i a master of
(09:28) this thing and so lots of love mosey nation keep being awesome i make this channel because a lot of people broke and i don't want you to be one of them i think i said this earlier but my name is alex ramose i own acquisition.com you know all the dollars things like that and i'll see you guys next video bye

Transcript:
(00:00) the single most important decision that you have in increasing your net worth do you guys know what it is it is not the business that you start it is not uh the industry even that you are in that's important it is not the market you serve it is not your pricing it is not your legion strategy it is one thing it is who you marry the reason that i think this is one of the most important decisions you make in your life is because that person will either be constantly grating at you or that person will be supporting you and i think the vast
(00:32) majority of marriages either fall in the grading category or the neutral category the number one question that i get related to this is how do i get my wife and this is more for the fellas but for ladies just reverse the genders how do i get my wife to be like layla how do i get her to like business and the simple answer is you don't because you don't change who you marry right you're not they're not going to change right and so what i wanted to do is kind of explain to you how this came to be for us and i think that we have a
(01:01) lot of counter-intuitive or contrarian views on marriage and love and i think that we have a very very good marriage and it has worked really well and so i'll share some of the things that have been different for us than most people so when i met layla we actually went on a date and it was a 15 minute day because i tried to get her to do uh froyo because i said it was low commitment and if either of us was weird we could dip out really quickly and so she agreed and so we went to froyo and uh and you know within a little bit we we hit it off but
(01:30) not in the way that you would normally expect like there was not any there was really no romantic anything there was no chemistry i wasn't like man i think this girl is amazing i was just like very interested in her um and i thought she was smart and i thought she liked the same stuff as me so i was like this is cool like she's interesting we ended up walking and talking for like four hours but we didn't have any like romantic chemistry at all and even like on our second or third date layla was like i don't really get
(02:00) any vibes from you like romantically at all i was like okay cool but over time obviously uh we worked on that but in that first couple dates uh she was in fitness and she was like one of the top salesmen at 24 hour fitness at the time and i had a and i and i was in fitness too and i had you know a few gyms at the time and so i said gosh you got to stop working for them you should work for me because i knew if someone could sell i knew we could make a lot of money together and so i pitched her on the idea of quitting
(02:29) her job and coming to work for me which of course she said no because she just met me from the internet but anyways i i did end up saying hey i'm gonna do this thing called gym launch and she was like okay i don't care i just met you and i was like it's gonna be it's gonna be something and so i went and um i flew and did the first three gym launches this is when we used to fly out and i did like gym turnarounds and we did i did three of those and i came back she picked from the airport we talked on the phone every night and i had not
(02:53) taken her on a date up to this point so now it's been like two or three months at this point that we'd been quote dating i had actually taken her out anywhere it was always like hey if you just wanna like hang out with me i'm gonna be working all day and it was that was kind of like we spent every day together but it was just like i just enjoyed being around each other and so we did this right uh we i came back she picked me at the airport and she was like you better take me on a date i was like okay okay one thing first right uh you gotta help
(03:16) me process these contracts and she was like ah fine we went i poured us both a drink and i taught her how to process the contracts and then within an hour we'd process a hundred thousand dollars in sales and she looked at me she was like what do you do again and i was like ah now you're interested and she was like is it legal i was like yeah it's legal and she was like okay i'm in at that point she actually left her her roster of personal training clients and joined me in launching the gyms and so we very much started our relationship in
(03:47) business together and then learned the love and romance side i think the business side i think she said this too it became natural to both of us we we naturally worked well together and i think there's no coincidence that my business has exploded once i met layla because she really was the yin to my yang when it came to everything that we had to do and this is important for anybody who has a partner in business the the thing that got us from four or five hundred thousand dollars a month to making millions a month was
(04:18) understanding the division of roles and so i you know she was really naturally good at sales uh and so was i and so we were both kind of like just you know tag teaming and that was cool in the beginning because everyone was kind of doing everything but at some point we needed to divide up responsibilities and so we went to a mentor we drew everything on the board of what we needed to do and there's this huge thing of just tasks and activities that we're doing every single day every single week and so he took this big marker and he drew a
(04:44) lot you know big circle around like 80 percent of it and he was like all right all this goes to layla and the stuff that was just marketing sales and product he was like this is alex's and i was like oh this is a great deal right and the thing is is that layla being as growth-oriented as she is basically i remember because she kept telling herself she was like i'm not going to be the reason this business fails and so she just learned all of this stuff i mean i think that's one of the big reasons that that we were able to
(05:07) massively explode after that because we had an amazing operator who could basically fulfill on the promises and and handle the the flow that i could generate and so we started working together and then it became kind of weird because you know the business was growing really quickly and some of the employees were like so you guys are just like dating we're like yeah and they're like they start to get worried because like what if you guys break up you know and we were like oh we broke up we'd still do the business together but it got to a
(05:32) point where i was like you know this is this is getting to we need to make a decision about this relationship and so i actually came to layla and i had a true proposition all right like a proposal in the in the truest sense of the word and so i said what do you what would you say um if we got married i was like i think it makes a lot of sense and she was like i mean i i would say yes and i was like all right i was like well here's my reasoning and so i broke down the reason i was like we're both young i was like we both have persian
(06:06) backgrounds we're both so we have the same cultural things like we get that that side of ourselves we both like fitness you like business we work together all right i was like i feel like this could this makes sense like we should do this and so she agreed and so we went we got in the car and we went and uh i was like i guess we gotta get you a ring and so he got in the car got her a ring came back 45 minutes later he was like well shoot i guess we gotta get a church thing organized and so we called up a pastor and i was like you
(06:34) free wednesday night and he was like yeah i think it was like a sunday um and he was like are you sure like this is fast and we're like yeah we're sure so we went to the back to church and got married uh that wednesday night so we were engaged for like less than a week and um that was it we actually told our parents after uh we got married so no one knew uh we just we got married and then told everyone afterwards it was pretty cool and it's been interesting though because our the business always came easy and the
(07:00) romance and the relationship was the part that we had to work at um the love side of the relationship because we just we mesh so naturally on the business side and so i say this to say for everyone who continues to ask the question how do i make my wife like layla i think that you're not going to do that i think laila is layla right and i think that your wife is your wife or your partner is your partner right and so you have to figure out what that yin and yang relationship is going to be and if that person is not in the business
(07:28) it is leilani is both of our beliefs that there are really only two roles that that person can play in your life they can either be and i got this from garyvee but i 100 agree with it um you they can either be a cheerleader or they can be a fullback all right so the cheerleader is the person who's on the sideline who's cheering you on to win the game right because at the end of the day the cheerleader who actually wants the team to win would never ask the quarterback to come out of the game when the game is on the
(07:53) line all right and you know the difference because if when the game is on the line that cheerleader is asking you to throw in the towel asking you to to hang your locker you know put stuff up in the locker room and leave the game with that per with them then that's not a cheerleader that's neither right and that's my point is that if they're not doing one of these two things they are detracting from what you ultimately want to do and there's nothing wrong with a spouse who's not in the business that's totally fine and it's a decision and
(08:16) that's okay right but you still need to be supportive all right so the question are you going to be supportive in that you are covering the other aspects of your life together and the role that that cheerleader plays is that when you are not at work it helps you detach from works you gain distance gain perspective you can realize that there are other things that are important in life which ultimately will actually make you a better business person because if business is the only thing you have right then all of your chips are always
(08:39) on it which makes you more emotional and erratic and makes you make worse decisions so if you realize it gives you context and perspective which is why whenever you have a death of someone who's close to you the gift of that death is the perspective that it gives us right and so that is the role that that cheerleader has is they give you perspective and context to the importance or relative importance of business in your life right but they are supportive because they understand that it is for the team right the other role is the role is the
(09:05) dynamic that layla and i have which is the full back uh roll which is that one person is block blocking while the other person carries the ball down the down the field and we're rotating right one person blocks the other person carries one person blocks one person carries and that has been the role um that we have had is that we're both on the field together and so um each of those has different pros and cons right uh and we we were big believers are big followers of esther perel who's a relationship expert and i think this was such a i'm
(09:33) going to share this with you because i think it's so valuable as americans or many of us in the western world we want to solve problems when in reality many times there are dichotomies that must be managed but cannot be solved i'll give you a business example how do you solve micromanaging versus uh you know abdication or delegation right how do you how do you solve that you don't solve it it is a dichotomy that must be managed and relationships as we see them have the same dichotomy between closeness and familiarity and distance
(10:03) and intrigue all right and so what happens is in the beginning of most relationships because you are so distant and you have some similarities if you take some steps towards closeness the relationship improves right you get to know the person better you start to trust them more and you're like this is awesome but what happens is that if you continue down that path you become brother and sister and you just become roommates because you live together you're so familiar there's no variety and there's no mystery there's no
(10:27) intrigue right and believe me as layla and i we work together we live together we're in the same house we work out at the same jet like we spend all of our time so what we have to do is we actively create space and so i think what's important is to figure out where you are on this dichotomy and figure out what action or where you need to lean towards in your tendencies in the relationship to find the middle ground and obviously it's going to sway it's like a pendulum but you try and keep it in the middle and so for us like i said because we're
(10:55) in business together we actually have to actively create space so we have different offices they're on opposite sides of the house we try not to be on the same meetings and things like that because at the end of the day if i want to say hey would you do today actually don't answer i was on every meeting with you there's no space everything is familiar and familiarity though comforting is not attractive right and so which is why you know like it's like joke the joke is like it's like a brother or sister right like you live
(11:22) together but like it's like right because you're so familiar right you know everything about that person now the flip side is a complete stranger there's all the mystery but there's no trust right and so to have the long-term relationship it is our belief that you have to manage both of those things and so the flip side is a lot of people get married right and one person works and one person doesn't work and that's okay but what happens is they start to grow apart and because they're not sharing the same reality they go further further apart
(11:52) until the person feels like a stranger to them right and you've probably heard that from people right and so if you're in one of those relationships then the goal should always be how can we share our experience how can we create a shared reality how can we grow together and make sure we are growing in the same direction because the entrepreneurial stimulus that you're going to get from business is going to change you it is going to force you to adapt and by extension grow and the stimulus that your partner is going through is going
(12:16) to force them to adapt and grow and the goal is how can we align that growth so it's in the same direction so that we look at each other 15 years from now we don't think who did i marry right and the person you might have changed and so might have they but i think that in order to maintain the relationship it's maintaining the the middle ground of that dichotomy and so for us our process around this is uh is we always create space to be missed um and i think that some of you who have maybe had a spouse or somebody who you
(12:43) spent a lot of time with if you actually go travel somewhere and then come back it's almost like your relation in my opinion i feel like my experience has been it's been better and so it's like you're like miss the person and i think that we need to create more space to be missed especially if you work with your spouse and so for us the relationship has been very much a love logically format we both share the belief that you can create love through actions and so we did not have the romantic love we learned it we
(13:07) actually i you know i i would not say that i was in love with layla when we got married real talk i was not in love with layla when we got married i loved her as a person um and i thought that the decision made sense but we were not in love and it took us i would say it took us until i'd say it took us until 2020 uh december of 2019 we kind of came to a head and we both said that we didn't want to keep living our lives this way so we had you know we were just making i mean a lot of money and we still do but like
(13:38) our lives are very different now right and it was all because the the money that we made for both of us was out of scarcity and lack right we were so fear driven that we were going to lose the thing that we made and so just so you know as you're as you're building your business in the beginning you fear being poor as you kind of transition in the middle you fear losing the status that the the money has gotten you right and so the fears change over time but anyways we've gotten to this point and i think we had
(14:04) made 30 million dollars in profit in the last 24 months um and we both were like i don't want to keep living this way and so that was when we decided going into 2020 that we were going to like prioritize our marriage and so what's interesting is that in 2020 despite the fact that our businesses got hit because of covert and went on we have a lot of brick and mortar uh based businesses uh our marriage probably like tripled that year in terms of how much better it is now et cetera and it was because we actively spent a lot of time um
(14:36) making sure that there was no space between us from uh from uh not in the way that i met earlier but that there were not things between us i think she uses the the catchment for that like whatever sits between you on the couch that you gotta make sure there's nothing there and so i think that there were some things that i you know i had held on to that i had resented and i think there were some things that she had done too or whatever i mean minor stuff but stuff that grows and i think even the fact that we were
(15:00) unhappy in working and making as much money as we were was growing was grading at both of us because we we both saw each other working so hard we were like well i don't want to be the one who's not working hard and so we both felt like we'd be letting the other person down and so i think we're even saying hey i'm not really happy with how life is going for us was actually really valuable because then it was like oh you feel that way too i feel that way and then all of a sudden it was like this whole thing diffused and it was
(15:23) this big fear that we had that if we voiced that we weren't happy with how something was going the other person would be like well i am happy right that wasn't the case at all and so by even just admitting that we had a shared reality it allowed us uh to move forward with a with a a perspective of like truth and integrity first and so not integrity in terms of line but truth and radical candor about about where we're at emotionally in the moment we've we really tried to keep that and it's been it's served us very well
(15:50) and so if you have a spouse who's in your business i think figuring out whether the person is a cheerleader or a full-back is an important step right and then adjusting whether you're trying to get closer or trying to get farther away from that person and create space if you need it or create closeness if you need it to manage that dichotomy uh is important and then finally uh understanding that at least for us love was something that we were able to create rather than something that we got had to marry for and so we married for logic we married
(16:22) for business reasons and i honestly it was one of the best decisions if not the best decision business-wise that i have ever made in my entire life and so um if you are in that situation then those are just a handful of perspectives i'll share more um as more come to me but i thought that it would be valuable since a lot of people continue to ask me about what is the working dynamic like between layla and i um and hopefully this video does a little bit uh to put some context to it so mozy nation i love you as always uh

(07:53) line all right and you know the difference because if when the game is on the line that cheerleader is asking you to throw in the towel asking you to to hang your locker you know put stuff up in the locker room and leave the game with that per with them then that's not a cheerleader that's neither right and that's my point is that if they're not doing one of these two things they are detracting from what you ultimately want to do and there's nothing wrong with a spouse who's not in the business that's totally fine and it's a decision and
(08:16) that's okay right but you still need to be supportive all right so the question are you going to be supportive in that you are covering the other aspects of your life together and the role that that cheerleader plays is that when you are not at work it helps you detach from works you gain distance gain perspective you can realize that there are other things that are important in life which ultimately will actually make you a better business person because if business is the only thing you have right then all of your chips are always
(08:39) on it which makes you more emotional and erratic and makes you make worse decisions so if you realize it gives you context and perspective which is why whenever you have a death of someone who's close to you the gift of that death is the perspective that it gives us right and so that is the role that that cheerleader has is they give you perspective and context to the importance or relative importance of business in your life right but they are supportive because they understand that it is for the team right the other role is the role is the
(09:05) dynamic that layla and i have which is the full back uh roll which is that one person is block blocking while the other person carries the ball down the down the field and we're rotating right one person blocks the other person carries one person blocks one person carries and that has been the role um that we have had is that we're both on the field together and so um each of those has different pros and cons right uh and we we were big believers are big followers of esther perel who's a relationship expert and i think this was such a i'm
(09:33) going to share this with you because i think it's so valuable as americans or many of us in the western world we want to solve problems when in reality many times there are dichotomies that must be managed but cannot be solved i'll give you a business example how do you solve micromanaging versus uh you know abdication or delegation right how do you how do you solve that you don't solve it it is a dichotomy that must be managed and relationships as we see them have the same dichotomy between closeness and familiarity and distance
(10:03) and intrigue all right and so what happens is in the beginning of most relationships because you are so distant and you have some similarities if you take some steps towards closeness the relationship improves right you get to know the person better you start to trust them more and you're like this is awesome but what happens is that if you continue down that path you become brother and sister and you just become roommates because you live together you're so familiar there's no variety and there's no mystery there's no
(10:27) intrigue right and believe me as layla and i we work together we live together we're in the same house we work out at the same jet like we spend all of our time so what we have to do is we actively create space and so i think what's important is to figure out where you are on this dichotomy and figure out what action or where you need to lean towards in your tendencies in the relationship to find the middle ground and obviously it's going to sway it's like a pendulum but you try and keep it in the middle and so for us like i said because we're
(10:55) in business together we actually have to actively create space so we have different offices they're on opposite sides of the house we try not to be on the same meetings and things like that because at the end of the day if i want to say hey would you do today actually don't answer i was on every meeting with you there's no space everything is familiar and familiarity though comforting is not attractive right and so which is why you know like it's like joke the joke is like it's like a brother or sister right like you live
(11:22) together but like it's like right because you're so familiar right you know everything about that person now the flip side is a complete stranger there's all the mystery but there's no trust right and so to have the long-term relationship it is our belief that you have to manage both of those things and so the flip side is a lot of people get married right and one person works and one person doesn't work and that's okay but what happens is they start to grow apart and because they're not sharing the same reality they go further further apart
(11:52) until the person feels like a stranger to them right and you've probably heard that from people right and so if you're in one of those relationships then the goal should always be how can we share our experience how can we create a shared reality how can we grow together and make sure we are growing in the same direction because the entrepreneurial stimulus that you're going to get from business is going to change you it is going to force you to adapt and by extension grow and the stimulus that your partner is going through is going
(12:16) to force them to adapt and grow and the goal is how can we align that growth so it's in the same direction so that we look at each other 15 years from now we don't think who did i marry right and the person you might have changed and so might have they but i think that in order to maintain the relationship it's maintaining the the middle ground of that dichotomy and so for us our process around this is uh is we always create space to be missed um and i think that some of you who have maybe had a spouse or somebody who you
(12:43) spent a lot of time with if you actually go travel somewhere and then come back it's almost like your relation in my opinion i feel like my experience has been it's been better and so it's like you're like miss the person and i think that we need to create more space to be missed especially if you work with your spouse and so for us the relationship has been very much a love logically format we both share the belief that you can create love through actions and so we did not have the romantic love we learned it we
(13:07) actually i you know i i would not say that i was in love with layla when we got married real talk i was not in love with layla when we got married i loved her as a person um and i thought that the decision made sense but we were not in love and it took us i would say it took us until i'd say it took us until 2020 uh december of 2019 we kind of came to a head and we both said that we didn't want to keep living our lives this way so we had you know we were just making i mean a lot of money and we still do but like
(13:38) our lives are very different now right and it was all because the the money that we made for both of us was out of scarcity and lack right we were so fear driven that we were going to lose the thing that we made and so just so you know as you're as you're building your business in the beginning you fear being poor as you kind of transition in the middle you fear losing the status that the the money has gotten you right and so the fears change over time but anyways we've gotten to this point and i think we had
(14:04) made 30 million dollars in profit in the last 24 months um and we both were like i don't want to keep living this way and so that was when we decided going into 2020 that we were going to like prioritize our marriage and so what's interesting is that in 2020 despite the fact that our businesses got hit because of covert and went on we have a lot of brick and mortar uh based businesses uh our marriage probably like tripled that year in terms of how much better it is now et cetera and it was because we actively spent a lot of time um
(14:36) making sure that there was no space between us from uh from uh not in the way that i met earlier but that there were not things between us i think she uses the the catchment for that like whatever sits between you on the couch that you gotta make sure there's nothing there and so i think that there were some things that i you know i had held on to that i had resented and i think there were some things that she had done too or whatever i mean minor stuff but stuff that grows and i think even the fact that we were
(15:00) unhappy in working and making as much money as we were was growing was grading at both of us because we we both saw each other working so hard we were like well i don't want to be the one who's not working hard and so we both felt like we'd be letting the other person down and so i think we're even saying hey i'm not really happy with how life is going for us was actually really valuable because then it was like oh you feel that way too i feel that way and then all of a sudden it was like this whole thing diffused and it was
(15:23) this big fear that we had that if we voiced that we weren't happy with how something was going the other person would be like well i am happy right that wasn't the case at all and so by even just admitting that we had a shared reality it allowed us uh to move forward with a with a a perspective of like truth and integrity first and so not integrity in terms of line but truth and radical candor about about where we're at emotionally in the moment we've we really tried to keep that and it's been it's served us very well
(15:50) and so if you have a spouse who's in your business i think figuring out whether the person is a cheerleader or a full-back is an important step right and then adjusting whether you're trying to get closer or trying to get farther away from that person and create space if you need it or create closeness if you need it to manage that dichotomy uh is important and then finally uh understanding that at least for us love was something that we were able to create rather than something that we got had to marry for and so we married for logic we married
(16:22) for business reasons and i honestly it was one of the best decisions if not the best decision business-wise that i have ever made in my entire life and so um if you are in that situation then those are just a handful of perspectives i'll share more um as more come to me but i thought that it would be valuable since a lot of people continue to ask me about what is the working dynamic like between layla and i um and hopefully this video does a little bit uh to put some context to it so mozy nation i love you as always uh

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video i'm going to break down how i learned how to consistently generate leads independent of platforms and the key piece that i was missing in multiple different platforms i'm going to tell you five key stories throughout my life that massively impacted how effective my marketing was as a result of the exchange and if you don't know who i am my name's alex mozy i'm a business investor and i own acquisition.
(00:19) com it's a portfolio of companies that's about 85 million a year i make these videos have to document the lessons that i've had and hopefully make sure that the pain that i suffered on the way here was not in vain so if you're new to mozi nation welcome and enjoy the video in this video i'm going to walk you through why you are probably not getting the results that you wish you were from what you are doing one of the most misunderstood concepts that create success in some people and failure without understanding why in most others all right and it really all
(00:45) underpins volume so let's dive in so a few high level observations before i dive into this the first thing is uh there's a setting in our community called do the boring work and a lot of times we don't confront the work that we that must be done because it's not exciting or sexy and it feels somehow like it's beneath us you know prospecting and doing 100 a day can feel tedious you know posting and repurposing the same content across lots of different media sources can feel tedious you know reaching out to people you know
(01:10) and asking them if they know someone who might be interested in your products or services might feel tedious or creating you know 100 different ad variations with different hooks and headlines can seem tedious it's very easy to understand very hard to do mostly because people don't have the discipline and the work ethic to go through the boring work which kind of leads to the second one here which is that uh there's a saying between my my closest friend and i dr catchy uh violence is the answer uh sometimes when you have this
(01:35) outcome that you must achieve in your life because of the goals and insecurities that we have set upon ourselves uh that just being violent with the level of activity that we are doing ultimately get us much closer than uh you know the nuances and the skill that sometimes we like to project and pretend matter more than just physically doing a sheer higher volume of work number three is that if you do more than you are doing right now you will get more than you currently have and that is a promise and you can take that to the
(02:00) bank and number four is do what matters most first so right now you probably have lots of things that you know fill up your day in the morning all that kind of stuff but the things there are only four activities that will actually generate more business for you period that is new all right number one is reaching out to people you know number two is posting to an audience that you know number three is reaching out to people who don't know one-on-one and number four is is advertising right those are the four only four ways you
(02:24) can get new clients and so if you're not doing one of those four things and you're struggling to get customers you're not doing lots of those four things as your primary activities then that is probably one of the reasons that you don't have the amount of customers that you wish you had all right and so what i want to do is take this quick moment to introduce an equation that i've thought a lot about but it's v times s times d so volume time scale times time and this is a kind of a flywheel that feeds itself and which and
(02:48) i'll get to the actual like wording behind this but essentially the more volume to do the better you are at it the longer you do it the more throughput you will ultimately have the more outcome the more clients the more sales the more leads you will ultimately have from doing it all right so let's dive into this in a little bit more so in other words and this is based on just like pure foundational principles of logic right the more we do the better we get the better we get the more we do because we like it because we're better
(03:13) at it right and the longer we do something the better we get the better we get the longer we do it right and i'll show you a couple examples in some of the stories and examples i have today that will show you how compounding massively affected my life and so in this way each of these three variables volume skill and time feed each other but it all starts with doing and so these are the three we're going to focus just on volume today because i want to be mindful of your time and so i'll tell you a quick example of this so
(03:41) i um when i this is probably a decade ago i was starting my gym which is the first business i own a real business that i own someone's like oh you should run flyers and i was like okay cool so i went out i did you know a bunch of flyers it you know it didn't really work for me and so you know a few months later i was talking to a friend of mine who had you know multiple successful locations he was doing well and i was like hey uh you know i did he's like you should do flyers so i was like nah i did that it didn't work for me he's like
(04:06) well you know what what was your what was your test size and i was like test size what do you mean he was like well how many did you test before you you know scaled it up and i was like well i mean i put 300 out and he was like 300 like total and i was like well yeah he's like i don't he's like i don't even test for less than 5 000 flyers and all of a sudden i was like whoa he's like yeah he's like i'll put out a hundred thousand flyers a month he's like and i'll get a half a percent or a percent back he's like who walked through the
(04:33) door he's like yeah but hundred thousand flyers a percent back i get 30 people a day walking in my store and i was like holy cow my understanding of the sheer volume for the activity that i thought wasn't working was just dramatically under what it really was supposed to be and in that moment i had a belief broken about what volume really means this happens all the time and i'll tell you a couple other examples in a second but like this happens all the time even like fitness stuff people are like man why can't i get jacked and i'm like uh you
(05:00) know uh why can't i grow my arms it's like all right well how many sets of arms are you doing every week and they're like well i train arms twice a week i'm like what are you doing they're like well you know like three sets of ten and i'm like that's it like per week like so six total sets they're like yeah i'm like well try 12 sets six days a week and i guarantee your arms will grow they're like seriously i'm like yeah imagine that the more you do the more you look like you can do so i'll give you a different one that i had this
(05:25) isn't a in a paid ads example which is similar to flyers just a different platform i had a an agency owner who was walking who was talking to us in within our software company and he was like hey you know my lead flow's stalling out i can't seem to scale above a certain amount you know it's like okay well you know how many pieces of creative are you putting out you know uh per week and he was like he he confidently answered right so he was like he's like oh he's like that we have one point he's like we're putting out like five to ten
(05:49) pieces of content a week and i was like per week he was like yeah and i was like dude and i scrolled over i shared my screen of my creative department and i was like we're testing 30 pieces every three days he was like what i was like yeah it's level of output quantity of output the level like most people dramatically underestimate how much work it takes to make money right the thing is is once you understand and for most people and this is the point that i'm hoping somebody who's like hasn't gotten their first
(06:17) customer or wants to start on a new channel if you already have one working is you usually need to do a lot more because your s in that equation your skill level is low and you have no time that has compounded for you so you must compensate with extraordinary volume so that you can learn the skill and then begin the compounding process that will give you the throughput or outcome that you desire and so a lot of times you got to do a lot more in the beginning to get the ball rolling all right and when i was talking to grant about his uh his
(06:46) overarching content strategy i was like hey man you know how many pieces what's the framework that you use and he was like bro and this is actually this was in a different call i had with him that's not not on the channel he's like bro if someone's trying to sell you a framework he's like they're just trying to sell you something he's like it's about 10x and he said that it and he wasn't saying it in a in a pejorative way he meant it genuinely he's like dude he's like we just take massive action he's like we just try and be i'm the
(07:10) president he's like look at your instagram look at my scripts we pulled both of them up and he's like i'm posting six times a day he's like i'm posting 15 times a day on twitter and she's like you just pulled up every one of them compared them to mine he's like he's like i'm just doing way more than you and i was like man and he's been doing it for 10 years longer right and so that was a huge epiphany for me and then for me i i switch from one time a week to one times a day and here's what's crazy my growth organically 40xed
(07:38) from a 7x increase in effort so there is a multiplicative effect here because sure we did more but we got better at the doing and then the more we did the more each of those other pieces fed one another right and so again all of this starts with the doing and taking a lot more than most people anticipate to get the result and get going and so this is a different nuance on volume this is more level of effort but i think it it bears mentioning because for this concept to kind of sink in i want to hit it from a couple different angles so
(08:08) this is the number one video or at this time is one of the number one videos on the channel and i made this like a month ago and i i realized that quality most times trumps quantity right and the thing is is but quality and quantity trumps just quantity right or just quality and so this particular piece of content took me 20 hours to actually put the slide deck together and then two days of travel to go film and then go lo and behold it ends up being you know the number one thing on there and to me i was like well that's not really
(08:36) surprising i spent a ton of time on this and so it was just and like i'm just saying i get reminded of this at all levels of the game you know what i mean and so i'm making these videos because like as i'm learning it i'm sharing it um so that hopefully it provides some value to you like it just takes a lot more work than most people think like layla this is four or five years ago when we were re-filming an entire content portal so she had probably recorded god i don't know 70 or so videos with you know trainings and
(09:03) everything and she got done and she was like i don't think these are that good and she was i was like it's like she's like i just i don't know i don't know if they're like hitting the way i want them to be they're like just not as crisp and we sat there and and i was like i'll do them again she looked at me and she was like yeah you're right because the thing is is like and i've said this before and i'll keep saying it like your work works on you more than you work on it the thing we are developing is our character because that's the ultimate
(09:28) prize that we get at the end of the race right we can't keep the stuff that we have with us and so we're doing this work to become better people right and so if you do it again it's no it's nothing bad about it you're just like cool i get more practice at doing the thing and my s is going to get better in the throughput equation so even if you did the same in terms of volume of output the skill on the equation the s is going to be higher so you're still going to actually still get more throughput even if you do the same
(09:53) effort again right and so that's why the level of effort in in giving a for lack of a return and really working like violence is the answer doing the boring work and putting the the time under the bar in to use a fitness analogy um is is what is required and most people dramatically underestimate the volume all right and so i'm going to tell you this last one to wrap this wrap this little uh piece up which is i wrote this book right it took me basically like a year to write it it took me two weeks to write it took me a
(10:22) year to edit it and right now i get dms every day like when is the second book coming out and so right now i'm on the fifth version of book two end to end i had to completely copy copy write edited from a professional editor and that was version one and i've since made four more versions since then but the thing is is the difference between that level of effort is why many times i think things don't work out is that most people put like a 7 out of 10 effort or an 8 out of 10 effort and then look at somebody who put a 10 out
(10:50) of 10 effort in and think well i didn't put that much less effort in but you don't realize the difference between 8 and 10 might be 5 times the work but also the difference between an 8 and a 10 might be a hundred times the outcome and so the actual net outcome on the incremental increase in work is still worth it that's what's crazy is that if it takes five times the effort to go from an eight to a ten you might get a hundred times even though you only did five times more work and so this is one of these beliefs that i i've ingrained
(11:18) in myself within how we do business but i'm sharing it with you because most things that most people make suck most products suck most marketing sucks most businesses suck and most people suck at the things that they think they're good at right and it's because they don't even know how to work they don't even know how to do it and i'll tell you this final story to wrap this up when i was a legal intern in a past lifetime at a chemical company called arkema in france believe it or not i worked there in the legal department and this older more
(11:45) experienced you know senior lawyer at the firm in the department kind of like tap i was like oh i'm going to go back to work and she like tapped my shoulder and she was like you don't even know how to work and i was like what do you mean and she was like you're so young she's like you don't even know what work really is and it and it just hit me and it struck me like to my core because i was like how can she tell me that i don't know how to work but here i am 10 years 15 years later and i think to myself like man i had no idea what
(12:10) work even looked like because i don't even know how to focus the way i do now i didn't know how to eliminate distractions i didn't know what it looked like to just put rep after rep after rep after rep in to just get that thing just right the beautiful thing especially when it comes to marketing stuff is that when you make those each of those posts each of those outreaches each of those calls each of those ads that you run make you better they increase the s and so in that way the v the s and the t the volume the skill and
(12:36) the time work on each other and then yield you a higher throughput because they are multiplicative not additive and that's like the one thing that if i can drive this home is that most people just do so much less volume than they think because and then they look at the the vehicle that they're using and think why is this not working when the reality was that you were not working because you did not know how much work really was required to get to where you wanted to go and so um with that in other words most times you just need to do more than
(13:03) what you're currently doing and a lot more of it okay so if you don't uh know me like i said my name is austral mosey i own acquisition.com we're business investors our portfolio does about 85 million dollars a year if you enjoyed this video watch another one and lots of love either way mostly nation keep rocking

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on everyone in this short video i want to tell you a story about how you can position your marketing in a way that gets a lot more people to respond to it independent of whether you may like it or not and so when i was starting out right i struggled to get people to buy what i knew would help them right so when i started in fitness i wanted to say hey there's a sustainable way uh to look the way you want to look you just need to learn how to count your macros and and and and do resistance training and if
(00:30) you do that you look the way you want to look but for whatever reason my marketing that talked about that because i knew it was true didn't get people to respond right and i didn't get any new customers even though i knew i was saying the truth right and later on in my career uh before i learned this lesson i was doing marketing for a dentist uh and i was and i was running ads and and we had landing pages that we had built and it was working and he called me up furious and he was like this looks horrible this is terrible for my brand i would
(01:00) never sign up for something like this and i was like well it's a good thing that you're not your customers you already have nice teeth right and so the story that that rant that drove this home for me was a story that's become famous in our community called the ham and the garlic and so the way the story goes is there's a little kid and he was incredibly uh excited to please his dad right and his dad one day decides to give him a dog and says listen son you got to take good care of this dog and if you don't take care of
(01:32) the dog then it means you're not responsible all right so you got to take good care of it if you're if we're going to buy it he says okay so he gives him the dog and so one day the dad goes to work you know a couple weeks later and the kid sees the dog he's playing with him and you notice he's got ticks all over him and he's like oh my god he's super distraught he's like what am i going to do what am i going to do and so he runs over uh into the other room whose grandmother who's looking after him while his dad's at work and he says
(01:54) grandma like what what do i do the dog's got ticks all over him and the grandma says ah mijo you just have to give the dog some garlic all right so go feed him some garlic and then the ticks uh you know will go away so the kid goes and he tries to feed the dog garlic and the you know the dogs move in his head because he because it smells like garlic it doesn't eat it right and so uh he goes back to the grandmother and says grandma i i try the garlic it didn't work what do i do and she says meow did you just try and give
(02:23) him the garlic straight up and he's like yeah he says ah you know you have to wrap it in ham wrap it in ham first then feed it to the dog and so he's like okay so he wraps it in half and goes to the dog the dog eats it and then a couple you know an hour later the ticks start crawling up the wall uh because it's the dog starts you know sweating alcoholic whatever right and the kid feels saved because the dog is taken care of and the dad still is proud of him etc but the moral of the story is that you have to give people
(02:53) what they want in order to give them what they need and so many times people are not at the perspective from which to they don't have their perspective they don't have the context to understand what you're saying because you already in the know and so you have to go back in time to before you knew what you knew what you know now and meet people where they're at and then walk them across the bridge to where you need them to go and so when we started marketing fitness we would market you know short short duration challenges detoxes things like
(03:20) that because we knew that people who were in that state of mind what they want is a quick fix right and so what we would have to do is we'd bring people in we'd give them what they want to get them to respond and then once we earn their trust we said hey i know you had a little you know we had some success in this first you know a few weeks but you're not here just for a few weeks because you don't want to gain it back right of course not right you really want this to be a long-term thing because if you lose it and gain it back
(03:45) what's the point they're like yeah it's like and at this point we said this is the garlic which you need to do is you need to learn how to count your calories you got to learn how to eat macros you gotta learn how to train for real all right and so when we had that we now had the context to have the truthful conversation with them and deliver the garlic right but it took the ham to get them in the door and so right now you may have something that you're trying to market in your business you're trying to get your customers in the door and
(04:10) you're marketing from a position of already knowing the answer and that's the issue and you may shake your fist at these other these other marketers your competitors they're like you're like man they're they're marketing short duration things that they're marketing these whatevers right but they're probably marketing it because it's working for them and so i'd encourage you to shift your perspective from saying this is the truth to this is their truth right now and i need to meet them where they're i have to go back across the bridge to
(04:36) where i used to be talk to them in that language relate to them understand their problems and their fears and then with my once i've convinced them to trust me enough then deliver the the garlic to them so you have to give them what they want in order to give them what they need and this is in essence what a lot of great marketing is especially if you have any type of business that has any sort of transformation that you're delivering anything that the other person has to take some steps towards you in order to
(05:04) be successful and so that stories always stuck with me because it applies to any type of coaching or mentor mentee relationship or really anything that you're you're marketing to the public where you need them to break a belief in order to consume your service or or get the result that you need them to have right or that they really need for themselves and so many times you can't begin with the end you can begin with the end in mind you do not begin with the end you have to start where they're at and then tape them along the journey the same one
(05:31) you did so that they can get to where they want to go which is where you know is going to be the best place for them so anyways i hope this was valuable for you um if you like that i'm sure there's buttons and things that you can click and learn more and all that stuff but anyways keep being amazing have an awesome day and i'll catch you soon [Music] [Music] [Applause] you

Transcript:
(00:00) everybody messes up it's part of business your employees are going to mess up you're going to mess up as a boss your customers are going to think you messed up even when you didn't mess up messing up happens and so if you act every time like you have never had a mess up before then you are going to mess up even worse and so I'm going to talk you about three different stories about big mess ups that I have done and been an experiencer of and some tactical things that you can do that have made our businesses so much better and turned
(00:27) onear reviews into five star reviews and the step-by process thinking through that what do you do when you mess up right cuz you're going to you're going to mess up in business you're going to mess up with a customer you're going to you're going to BU build someone the wrong amount you're going to give someone the wrong date you're going to forget to onboard someone you're going to have a package that doesn't get delivered it gets delivered to the wrong address you're going to you're going to onboard someone put the wrong company's
(00:50) logo on it um and every one of those examples that I just said is something that we have done at some point in my career and so I want to tell you two stories um and then I to drive home a couple of principles that have served us well um use them if you want but they have worked pretty well for us and so I'll tell you two kind of polar extremes so I I uh I buy a lot of gym equipment um even though I'm not even in the gym industry technically anymore um I have a massive gym that is in our headquarters that's really sweet I'll just put it
(01:20) that way we've got like 85 unique pieces in the gym and it's just just for me and the team um and so I uh all the pieces are bought from Individual people I kind of put the pieces together that I like and so it's not just one distributor and so I had a piece of equipment that that I bought and I was really excited about it cuz I was like oh man I love this piece it's going to be awesome and when it showed up it was bent like the frame was bent um and the and the weight stack was kind of off and so one of the main
(01:47) polls was bent so then it was like this whole ordeal and when we called the company up he was like well uh I mean you you accepted the shipment and I was like yeah cuz the truck guy was like what do you want me to do this I was like all right we'll drop it off he's like well as soon as you accept the shipment it's your liability and I don't know if it like it happened before after that and I was like well I'm telling you it happened before and I just wanted to help the guy out who was the truck driver like complete his complete the
(02:12) runs that you had for the day and he was like sorry dude um and I was all right well I mean can we can we get like the pieces or something like a new frame that you can ship out just that piece and he's like well that's going to be extra and I'm like dude I bought this thing it arrived not the way that I bought it and now I'm incurring additional costs in terms of financial cost but I also have the additional cost of now I'm talking to you when I'd rather be using the piece of equipment and so the tldr of that is I basically just threw the
(02:42) piece out and I hate the person who I did business with and I will tell anybody who ever considers buying from them that they suck now let's take the alternative example so um last year I went to uh Orlando for jimc con and we stayed at uh the rits and when I went to the rits we had our team with us and so we went out they have a a Michelin star restaurant there which by the way I found out was actually named after Michelin tires totally random I saw like the Michelin tirean at the front of the restaurant I was like this feels weird
(03:16) but it's actually what it is anyways and so we go in there and it's this this really nice restaurant or whatever but it took three and a half hours to eat our entire meal we didn't get drinks for like 45 minutes we didn't get the appetizers until minute 990 and I was like dude this is ABS I was like I honestly just want to go get Chick-fil-A like I don't even care right and so anyways we finished the whole dining experience if you want to call it that and um the manager of the hotel you know our team was like hey just letting you
(03:46) know like this was pretty pretty tough and as soon as the manager found out about that he was so upset he was like oh my God I can't believe this happened we had just switched staff over we're training some team up and I think we were under you know short you know store sa that day whatever and he said but that's 100% our fault he said please let me make it up to you and so for the remainder of the trip like one he comped the dinner that we had there which was expensive uh then we got upgraded uh I think rooms for the rest of our stay
(04:17) they he said please like they delivered like fruit baskets and drinks and other stuff to our room throughout the day and my teams room so it's not just me like we had eight people with us staying in four or five rooms um and so so all of everybody got taken care of he made us reservations at two different restaurants the next basically every other night for us to choose from and then he met us at the restaurant to seat us at the table he got us the appetizers and drinks at the restaurants that he met us at to make sure that we were okay
(04:46) now I'll tell you this since then if I go to Orlando I stay at the rits and I talk and I talk to Javier because Javier is my dude and Javier goes above and beyond and the other guy at the other company I don't say anything about now I don't even want to say the name of the company because I don't want to give them air time all right and so I think there's some really interesting principles about this um that we've taken from uh for our business so Disney says that there's 37 magic moments that it takes to make up for one tragic
(05:16) moment and I think there's two kind of levels to thinking about this so the magic moments it means that it takes so many good things to make up for one bad thing so by all for all intents and purposes avoid the tragic moment because it's going to take you so many to make up for it but if you do have that tragic moment then you have to do a ton and I see that on kind of bir directionally now one of the things that um I like to think about a lot is like I never want to become someone's project and what I mean by that is like if if you piss
(05:46) someone off or you do something wrong and you know you did something wrong you don't you don't want that person to Stew and just think like how am I going to destroy this person like you don't want to become someone's project and so I've talked about the angry boat and I'm going to get to that in a second but I actually want to hit on this point because I think it's really important which is that a refund to a customer is an apology but you have to do better than that if you hit your wife and then you apologize it's not just like oh
(06:15) we're neutral it's just as if I hadn't hit her it's like and I'm doing this as a natural extremity hyperbolic but like you wronging someone and saying I'm sorry is not enough and so let me let me prove the point if you accidentally kill someone in manslaughter Society deems you saying sorry family isn't enough so what do what does the government do they sentence you and they put you in prison so they say you have to say sorry and you have to pay 10 years because of involuntary manslaughter they say sorry isn't enough and so refunding someone
(06:48) isn't enough if if Javier at the Ritz had just refunded me the meal I wouldn't be like stoked I would have been like well you wasted 3 and 1 half hours of my night and it's and like the food was cult like all these other things like I'm not like I'm not back to neutral right like one tragic moment he gave me a magic moment okay give me a refund and so one of the things that you have to wrap your head around and this took me some time is like you actually are going to go negative on refunds meaning like you're going to lose money you're not
(07:14) just going to be like oh well you paid me 100 bucks I'm going to pay you $100 back now we're even it's no because there's additional cost that they incur and so like they got dressed up like or like if we got dressed up to go out this nice restaurant we have expectations of the evening that are going to be really good and so not only did we pay money but we paid time and every person you know the the the gals of my team got all dled up and all that stuff and all of this is for it goes completely into the tragic perspective and so as a customer
(07:41) or one of your customers has one of these experiences it's like dude refunding is them is not enough hey real quick guys if you guys are enjoying this don't be a square share I I'm going to come up keep doing rhymes for this but um if you can screenshot this right now wherever you're listening and post it and tag me I'm going to share as many of these as I can on soci media and I will certainly make more of them if you tell me that you like them and so screenshot share tag and I will see you in five seconds and so we have to do have to go
(08:12) above and beyond and so one of the issues that happens though is that when when it happens and this is this is now me talking to the teammates so people who work in businesses like what you can't do and I'm just I'm just please I'm begging you what you can't do is try and minimize it to the customer right like Javier could have been like oh I mean like basically by saying you're being ridiculous don't be a victim like that's what the like that's whatever you say when the person's like hey the food was late the what all
(08:39) you're doing is trying to invalidate them you're basically saying you're lying or you're not telling the truth or I mean pick pick your poison and you're basically saying that you don't matter that's what you're saying and so what happens is is that people then escalate to be like yes I do matter and you don't understand and not only that but I'm gonna punish you and so what do you think onear reviews are think about it for a second a one-star review is a customer's way of being the judicial system and saying okay this person
(09:12) refunded me but they needed to do more and so I'm still going to jam them I'm still going to put them in prison even though they apologize for killing my husband in manslaughter right even though they apologize that wasn't enough so I'm going to punish them with a review because that's all I can do those are the things that they have control over and so we have to go above and beyond and so I'll give you an example recently and so we had a we had a scheduling mishap um and we had seven people who were going to fly out to our
(09:41) headquarters and basically they came here and there was nothing happening that day because the sales team messed up times and so it's like and and five of these are international think about this you you travel across the country across the world to you get your expectations up some people have to apply for visas like big big big like expectations big work big money all of these things like beforehand right and they show up and like nothing's happening there was a scheduling mishap right and so what do you do right like
(10:12) that's a big big mess up that's a big mess up it's absolutely unacceptable so here's what you don't do you don't say hey you should have checked the email or hey we sent some other correspondents that that might have you know conf conflicted like you don't go into any of that because it doesn't matter they don't care what matters is that it's always immediately your fault and you have to be angrier about it than they are and this is the angry boat the thing is is that even though I preach this it's still hard to
(10:42) do when you're in the moment because no one wants to accept fault because fault is associated with all these negative things in our past because in the schooling system if you say your fault you go to detention like you get punished by saying it's your fault so you always want to blame hey Timmy is the one who who turned the music up not me so Timmy gets punished but the reality is that in business you always always want it to be your fault because if it's your fault it's under your control which means you you have the
(11:03) power to fix it that's what's key and so as soon as you have that instance you jump in the angry boat as fast as you can you want to be quicker to the draw at getting angry than the other person and a lot of times customers will have one of these experiences and they'll shoot out the situation to wait to see how you respond because they want to they want you to be upset about this because they are already angry and they're trying to contain themselves trying to contain their emotions and what you need need to do is be the one
(11:30) who gets emotional for them that is the ultimate validation is that something bad happens and you say that's ridiculous that's unacceptable oh of course we're going to give you your money back of course I'm going to refund all of your travel expenses which by the way is what we did we give them their money back give the travel expenses but that's still not enough it's not enough because if you traveled across the world you're like okay well great my flights but like I just lost 4 days of travel and I had these expectations that
(11:58) weren't met and so so we're taking the whole the you know the seven people out for 3 hours we're going to go to dinner we'll I'll probably I'll probably end up doing three hours of personalized Consulting for each of these businesses which is not something that I would normally do um in an effort to go above and beyond to make up for something that that otherwise shouldn't have happened and the reality is is this like let's be let's put our let's put our hats on for a second is this my fault Alex's fault was I the one who took the call was I
(12:29) the one who messed up the scheduling no but guess whose fault it is it's mine right I pay the people I'm the the buck stocks with me and so the idea that sometimes I see business owners saying things like well that you know my team messed dude you [ __ ] messed up like that's the thing about the entrepreneurship game is like you get you get the upside but you get the downside you get it both and you've got to be able to be comfortable with that and the thing is is like you have to accept and I want like this is the thing
(12:58) as soon as I go in my mind is like I flip this switch or it becomes a game of how can I blow these people away all right that as soon as I have like a clear and obvious Rong and it happens we mess things up we're human and humans work for us and humans make mistakes and so when as soon as as soon as that happens it becomes this game of oh Ro Y is out the window I'm already going to lose money on this duh right like you're going to give the money back plus extra cost that they incurred plus now you're still going to incur the cost that you
(13:26) would have normally done to to do deliver whatever it is that you do right but the thing is is I am an [ __ ] advocate of the Ritz Carlton and Orlando and Javier I tell everybody when they're like hey where should I go I'm like go there go to Javier he's the [ __ ] man and I tell everybody that and so I'll bet you they have more than made up for the transgression of the one restaurant experience and him meeting me at the other restaurants and sitting us down and taking 5 minutes before two or three or four other experiences we had while
(13:57) we were there those little minutes meant the world to me because I know what kind of business owner what kind of entrepreneur what kind of operator operates that way it's somebody who gets it you get the game which is that did Javier mess up he's not even he's not even responsible for the restaurant it's not even his division but he did it because he knows that I don't care and he had the power to fix it so even if it wasn't his fault for the transgression he had the power to fix it and so it becomes his responsibility to
(14:28) make it right and side note here with the angry boat is one you want to confront it headon you don't want to [ __ ] foot around it you got to say like this was our mess up and I'm super pissed about it second you want to get in fast third validate validate validate you want them to feel seen you want them feel heard you want them to feel felt you want them to feel felt you want them to feel like you you you feel their pain more than they feel their pain because here's the here's the reality and this is the this is the this is the underling
(14:55) Highlight point there is no way that you can minimize someone's pain only they can minimize it you cannot invalidate away someone's feeling about being wronged the only person who can say you know what it's not a big deal is them and so the only way for that to happen is for you to be more upset so that they say hey it's not that big of a deal calm down and then they said it not you because if you say hey it's not that big of a deal calm down they're going to be like r yes it is you need to validate me and then you're like oh my God you're
(15:32) right I should kill myself they're like d don't kill yourself and you're like right and they're like it's not that big of it de like okay fantastic they come back down and I say the I use I use hyperbolic extremes to make a point which is if you want someone to feel better about something that you did that wronged them they have to initiate it and the only way they're initiate it is if you make it a bigger deal to you than it is to them and so I want to I want to do a quick transition into um employee stuff around this so if you were the
(16:05) person who messed up like you're the actual person now of course it's the entrepreneur it's it's always our fault for sure but on some level if you're the person who messed up on the team let me tell you what not to do don't try and skirt along don't try and pretend like it's not a big deal when you say to the team don't try and minimize and be like oh yeah I kind of messed up the the dates on on that thing don't [ __ ] do that because it's the same thing in reverse because the like the owner your manager Your Leader the entrepreneur
(16:32) he's the customer she's the customer in this incident and I'll tell you what I want to see I want to see you losing your [ __ ] mind over how upset you are at this mess up because the thing is is if you're not upset enough I'm going to make you upset and so one of us is going to make you upset and you want it to be you not me being really real with you and so what I I'll tell you what I I'll tell you what I told um the individual I said listen I know because I know I know I know the person you know like obviously multiple
(17:03) parties blah blah blah but at some point sometimes the buck can stop with somebody I said listen I know that you're beating yourself up over this and you're beating yourself up over it in silence I was like but the thing is is like no one cares no one will give you credit for beating yourself up in silence they will give you credit for two things making it right and making sure it never happens again that's it that's all that matters and so there is there's no more useless emotion than feeling sorry for yourself
(17:32) it changes nothing like no one gets better by feeling sorry for themselves at all and so if you did mess up just skip past the guilt part skip past the shame part skip past that and go immediately into the what can I do to make it right what can I do to make it better than right sure you hit your wife sure you said sorry but now what we got to take her out to dinner get her a nice necklace get her some flowers and then go to [ __ ] anger therapy and make sure that you know like whatever like you you do all the things to go from tragic to neutral
(18:04) and then you go above neutral to try and make them into a champion and then you do all the things to make sure it doesn't happen again that's the point and so too many businesses basically think that a refund is the highest level of what they can do to make it right they're like I gave him his money back what else does he want a shitload more that's what that's what they want way more and the thing is is I'll tell you this is that if you incur the cost of the refund plus the additional cost is then you lose actual money actual
(18:32) resources trying to make it right guess what you try not to do you try not to [ __ ] up so much in the future because you know the real cost of it isn't just like and like don't even get me started on companies that won't give a REV like go don't give a refund on something like if people if if a a huge percentage of your customers are asking for refunds fix your [ __ ] or stop selling it like either you're selling it wrong and you're setting crazy expectations that no one no one can no one can live up to or your just delivery sucks but like if
(19:04) you're getting lots of re refund requests and then you you're like well I can't give the refunds otherwise I won't be in business then maybe you shouldn't be in business fix your [ __ ] and I get I get I get I get I get jazzed about this I like I came into the team this morning I was like oh I know what I'm G talk about because this is hot because we just mess this up we just had this mess up happen and like you have to own it and you have refunds Aren't Enough refunds are apologies no one cares about apologies people want
(19:34) more than an apology because they will punish you and society believes that too you don't just say I'm sorry I killed somebody I'm sorry I was in a I was a drunk driver and I killed your kid I'm s sorry is not enough a refund is an apology a refund is sorry and people want more than that and so you got to get them to neutral and then and here's the cool part so this is my silver lining for this is that if you do turn a tragic moment into a series of magic moments afterwards you can create brand Champions you have a higher potential to
(20:06) take somebody and make them A True Believer in what you do if when you mess up you own it and you make it better than right because they're like these guys messed up but they went so far out of their way and if anybody's ever had this experience and I hope you have at least one time in your life we a business owner went above and beyond they didn't just make it right they made it better than right and then what happens you become a customer for life you have a higher potential for being a customer for life and I remember there
(20:33) was a um an acquaintance of mine who was in the hot sauce business just kind of random and he had a c so he had um he had sent them a hot sauce kit or something and it didn't have caps and so he couldn't they couldn't use the hot sauce because it didn't have a cap in the kit and so he sent a handwritten note to them and he sent extra caps uh not just enough but like more of them just in case or whatever and they said um they they sent him back a note being like wow that was so nice of you like you went above and beyond
(21:04) whatever and so he actually started sending the kits with handwritten notes with an extra cap because of that experience because that person then went change their one star to a five star because of the great experience and I don't know if you've ever done this or you've seen this like updated reviews where people say hey I left this one star the the founder reached out to me he got on the phone with me he made it right the thing is is that people want to punish you when they feel invalidated and you can absolutely you can you can
(21:34) make them feel validated like the reason malpractice so they did a bunch of research like because both my parents are Physicians um there's a ton of ton of research on malpractice the people who get sued for malpractice are doctors that people hate not people who make the most mistakes isn't that interesting so they tell this story of a lady who uh had some sort of thing that happened that was wrong in like a clear lawsuit and she had had like two or three Physicians that she was going for like cancer or something whatever it was and
(22:04) when the uh she hired this male practice Journey because she wanted to go after this physician and so after doing more research the lawyer was like hey it's not this guy who actually technically made the mess up it's this one your primary care you're your general physician and the lady was like oh Sarah oh I love Sarah no it's it's fine and so it had nothing to do with the transgression it had to do with the fact that they actually hated the person and so the thing is is like people people people want to punish you if they don't
(22:32) like you and you you increase the likelihood that they do like you by going above and beyond and so here's one tactical thing one more last tactical thing uh from my notes that I'll give you if you deal in a business that has lots of transactions high volume transactions every day what you want to do is you want to give someone a box of responsibility you want to give a box of decision-making power and so they do this in in the hotel industry and this is why I like stealing things from one industry and putting to another and so
(22:57) for example if someone wakes up in the middle of the night because they smell smoke right and they come they call to the front desk they say hey I Smell Smoke I can't sleep blah blah blah that front desk person if they have no power to fix it the customer still holds them responsible so they basically you give them a losing card they can't do anything but if you say these are the things that you have within your responsib that within your power you can give someone free free drink credits you can give someone a free meal you can
(23:25) give someone a free upgrade all right so these are the three things you can do based on the level of the the mess up right if if someone had to wait 20 minutes for a bell hop okay is that like end of the world probably not here's here's two drinks uh just in case you're waiting or for tonight to make it special before you go out all right now if someone can't sleep because there's smoke and they shouldn't have had smoke in the that's a pretty big mess up so what do we do well if the front desk person has the power to upgrade them for
(23:51) the next room for the next night then you probably refund them for the night before and give them a free upgrade for the next night but you have to give people you have to give your team the two or three things that they can do and then just say listen if we're if you're using up more than five of these a month then like we need to fix a process here but these are things that you can give out as freebies that you bake into the profit margins of the business so that you know that you can make things right when things do inevitably grow wrong
(24:17) because people are human and humans dealing with humans leads to mistakes so um what to do when you mess up is don't just refund someone that is not enough go above and beyond and if you do that you might just turn a hater into a lifelong fan be awesome take care of your customers all that good stuff oh by the way share this if you can uh mean a lot to me and all that stuff otherwise I otherwise I'll stop doing these not really I won't stop doing them but it would just mean a lot more um if you did that because then I'll know that you do
(24:52) like it and then I will actually I will I will probably make more if you share it how about that rather than stop or start I will probably make more if you share it these um anyways keeping awesome catch you soon bye

The SIMPLE Managerial Framework that changed my business - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) when you're trying to diagnose a situation if you're asking an employee and i'll give you like some of the scripting around this at the end it's like hey is it this like i've noticed you're not doing this thing is it this this or this that's causing it and then you're not attacking the person you're attacking the process and it makes it much easier to talk about all right if you deal with human beings you are going to inevitably try to influence them at some point to do what you would like them to do and this happens within
(00:21) the context of when you go to a restaurant you ask waiter do you hope that they put the thing in for you right you want the food to come out the way you want to come out we have desires and demands that we make of the universe and we want them to come back to us based on our preferences now that being said when we run a company right we deal with employees and other people a lot in order to organize them in a single direction to get them to the outcome that we desire all right and so i have talked about this in the past but i will
(00:43) give you alex's simplest framework which is a triangle framework [Music] uh uh it matches acquisition.com and if you don't know why my name is alex from rosie on acquisition.com probably with companies that deserve a hundred million dollars a year to make these videos because i want you to make tons of money and then hopefully partner with us in the future to get from 3 million to 10 million to 20 million 30 million and beyond all right awesome so let's rock and roll so one of the easiest frameworks and i've actually been
(01:07) somebody who's struggled at the managerial side more than kind of like the strategy or the marketing things like that like i i've struggled more on the managerial side so for me frameworks here in some ways actually provide me for more value than other frameworks because some of these other frameworks came more naturally to me this one did not and this one is something that i have stolen ruthlessly from layla because she's the one who really does more the managing than i do um but i'm sharing this for the entrepreneurs of
(01:26) the world because i hope that you do not struggle as i did all right so if you want somebody to do something and they do not do it what do you do all right so there are three reasons that someone will not do something and part of this two of these i snagged from uh andy grove who was the founder and storied ceo of intel uh he wrote high output management which is an excellent excellent book it's very it's a little uh it's a little hot a little advanced but it's really good so recommend that being said he said there's only two
(01:51) reasons that an employee does not do what you want them to do which is either they do not know how or they are not motivated right and so he said therefore the job of the boss is to motivate and to train he said if you're not training you're not motivating you're not being a good boss and i thought that was wonderful that being said i came up on a circumstance in my life where both of those situations were not actually uh the case there was a third scenario which came up which is why i now have a triangle for why people uh don't do
(02:15) stuff all right number one is they don't know that you want them to do it and so i'll tell you a quick story so i i had a sales manager that i really wanted uh to succeed right and so uh we hired them and they were new and i was super excited and uh you know a few weeks in i was like hey dude had a conversation with some of the sales guys and uh you haven't done any call reviews wtf bro and uh the guy was like i was unaware that you wanted me to do call reviews i was like well i just i mean i just figured that's that's what you would do
(02:42) as a sales rep now mind you that is probably what they should be doing a sales director but guess what i didn't do i didn't tell him i didn't tell him i want him to do that and so two things here with uh with communicating expectations number one is you have to communicate them number two is you have to repeat the communication number three you have to make sure it's documented all right which means it's in writing and ideally multiple places and if you can make sure that as part of daily or weekly checklists or things that they
(03:01) report on the things that you ask them to give you are going to be the things that you subconsciously communicate are important to you all right so if you say hey i need you to report on these three metrics guess what they're going to think is important to you the three metrics if you want something to be done make sure they are reporting it to you on a weekly or daily basis the faster the communication cadence that you have around the item or task or activity or metric the more important they will deem it so if you meet twice a day about a
(03:23) specific metric they will think it's very important right if you meet once a quarter and you and it's one line item on a slide chart they will probably think it's less than board and if you don't report on it at all and never talk about it all they will definitely not think it's important and very very very high likelihood of not doing it all right so peak of the triangle here is communicate the expectation it sounds silly but when you think about this and this is why i'm sharing this framework is that when i have somebody who's not
(03:44) doing what i would like them to do or not adhering to the preferences that i have i think which one of these three is it so it's very helpful it's also really helpful when you're trying to diagnose a situation if you're asking an employee and i'll give you like some of the scripting around this at the end it's like hey is it this like i've noticed you're not doing this thing is it this this or this that's causing it and then you're not attacking the person you're attacking a process and it makes it much easier to talk about all right so that's
(04:03) number one number two is training which is do you not know how to do this thing do you not know how to do a call review well let me tell you what a call review looks like let's do two of them together and we'll record the thing so that in the future you can go back to it right this is what we're looking for this is the transitions this is how we take the notes and this is how i want you to communicate it to the sales team aha right and so not only did we communicate what we wanted we said hey this is how you do it and this is how i would like
(04:26) it to be done right and then finally this is how i want you to report on it to me so that i know it was done right very very simple but you know what people don't do it and being advanced is simply never not doing the basics and i do have a double negative there because that makes it makes you think a little harder but what it means is that bing advance is always doing the basics like that is what being advanced is is doing the basics even while you have tremendous volume right if you think about this for a second when people
(04:47) start small businesses they tend to grow because they have lots of personal interaction they provide lots of service they service with a smile and what happens they hire some teammates the the service goes down there's less smiles less skill and so what they did was they stopped doing the basics at scale that's all it is and that's why businesses plateau and so it's thinking about what are the things that made you successful in the beginning and then how can i duplicate those at scale it's always doing the basics that's what it is all
(05:08) right so number one communicating the expectations doing so ideally frequently and making sure it's measured and in writing and if we do that we have hit the peak of the pyramid number two is that we have the training side is that we showed them how to do it and how we want them to do it and how they how we want them to report on those things all right that's number two number three drum roll please is incentive is motivation is do they want to do the thing because think about it if i said hey dude i need you to do x y
(05:30) and z right and you know how to do x y and z and you're not doing it the reason might be that they are unmotivated now i'll give you the caveat here is that if someone says i've been too busy right now you can look at that as a because that's usually what will happen like let's go real world for a second right theory sounds great but let's what's real world they'll say i was busy because they're not no one's gonna be like i was not motivated right so part of that could be motivation right because if i said hey if i give you ten
(05:51) thousand dollars to get this done by tomorrow will you do it they probably would so i think with enough motivation they can do it but that being said they might also not have the training know how to manage their schedule in a way uh to prioritize these activities so you might have to train them on other components to make sure that it's easier for them right now that being said when you introduce that this three frameworks i just love it from a conversational perspective and how to assess and problems so if you have a teammate so
(06:13) this is for you right now real world if you have a teammate or a director or manager or an individual contributor who's in the company and they are not doing things to the extent that you want them to to the quality you want them to at the speed that you want them to or they're just not doing it at all think about using this three this three-prong framework which is like hey johnny you're underperforming right now and it's really unlike you right and the reason we say that is because it also embeds a compliment which is like it's
(06:35) not like you to suck right and so automatically we're actually protecting the ego of the person while still attacking the behavior all right it's really nuanced i learned that one from layla just being real but it works really really well she said hey it's not like you to be late for stuff so what's going on right it's not like you did not get your end of week reports in like what's going on right and this is where when you say that what's going on it's you look through the three lenses like what's going on is it you didn't know
(06:55) that i wanted you to do it did i not communicate it well is it that you don't know how to do it either in general or given your workload or is it that you're not motivated to do it right are there other priorities that are more motivating for you to do right and so when you ask those questions it gives them very clear boxes to direct their their replies and then you can isolate the issue and then you can solve it and the thing is is if you have the three boxes and you can isolate the issue and then you take the actions to solve it
(07:17) and if the activity still doesn't happen then you say hey we talked about these three boxes we solved the problem like i can't say we haven't communicated so is it just a motivation issue right and so at that point then you can get into a little bit more real conversations like you know what i actually hate this job and you're like you know like we hate having you i'm kidding you don't you wouldn't say that you could say you'd say oh my gosh that sucks let's see and if you like the person they're a cultural fit and they
(07:38) have other skills you may be like well maybe there's another role in the company that would fit you i would say nine times out of ten that's what you want to do it's usually not the right call because usually if you were to hire somebody for this other position that you might have opened the company you should probably just hire the person that you would normally hire there because if you look at that person and this person and a track record of failure does not make it a high likelihood candidate all right so big
(07:55) picture for everyone use the triangle of figuring out why people do not do the things that you want them to do which is one did i communicate the expectation to you am i doing it with adequate importance to tell you how important this is to me which is frequency and detail of communication and making sure that it's recorded down right the training oops that's the side of the triangle the training is that i actually show them how to do it and then how to manage the other things in general that they are doing so they can get all this
(08:16) stuff done yes check that box and then finally are they motivated or incentivized in order to get this done and so i talked about their internal motivation but there's also external motivation which is like do i need to do i need to realign their bonus structure do i need to rely on how they're getting compensated because if for example i ask them to do this thing and they're getting compensated for four other things and they don't get compensated for this extra thing well then guess what they're probably not going to be
(08:35) motivated to do the thing so we have to make sure that they are properly motivated you know internally as a human being in terms of their aligned with the company they see why this thing actually makes a difference all right this is a this is my last little little tidbit on this is that people a lot of times just want to know why just why why am i doing this and if you if someone understands why they're because otherwise activity without purpose is what they do at prison camps right it's pointless labor right and so that's the thing it's like
(08:59) you have to give it a point you have to give it a purpose right which is like when you update the crm with the notes from your calls it helps finance it helps judy in finance actually have good conversations with these people which helps us collect more money and helps us get more people staying on track right it helps uh cindy in customer success on the onboarding give them a much more personalized experience so we want to sell something great right don't you want to sell something great well if you don't put notes in you're actually
(09:23) selling something that's worse because we're going to provide a worse experience for them right and so they're going to get on the onboarding call and we're going to be able to have no personal life we're not going to know what their issues are we're not going to know what their pains are we're not going to know what they're struggling with and then we can't even help them more so you're going to try and sell them this amazing solution and then we're not you're not giving us the the ammo to actually do the things that you
(09:38) have just promised them oh right and the other reason we do this is because for us to not waste your time so now i just did two benefits to the global benefit which let's be real a lot of people might care about if they're good people but a lot of people do not so but for you specifically when you leave the notes it helps us screen out candidates on the front end so that we can use that data to make your call likelihood of close higher so that a higher percentage of your time is spent closing people and talking to people who have the money who
(10:03) have the problems that we actually fix rather than wasting time with tire kickers and people who are probably not going to buy does that make sense right so when you do this we help you sell more and make more money fair enough great and so you can appeal to the the larger picture of like why do we need this as an organization but then also if you can ideally tie it back to a personal benefit uh to why it benefits them a lot of people just don't know and so just explaining that process you hit all three of the triangle boxes and you
(10:26) are far more likely to get somebody who does the things that you're asking to do so that your company can grow the way that you want it to so you can make all the money in the world and then wonder why you did it to begin with all right motivation keeping awesome lots of love and i'll catch you guys next video bye mostly nation you guys are the best and if you could do me the biggest favor for the entire world click the like button comment below so i can answer more of your questions in the videos and make sure that i'm not just making stuff out

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on everyone um i wanted to i'll probably make a couple of podcasts um about my day yesterday but it was our quarterly meetup for our leadership and uh there was kind of you know there's a few kind of i don't want to say teaching moments but moments where i was kind of able to transfer some of my you know more updated beliefs about how a company should run um that they were like man i wish we'd record this like that would've been such a good podcast and so um i want to try and do my best and kind
(00:26) of cover some of those points with you here so you can almost be like a fly on the wall in some of those meetings and so the first one was about the role of hr now um before all of the entrepreneurs who are listening to this you know have their eyes glaze over this is probably the first podcast i've ever made about you know hr and human resources but i think it's incredibly important and it's not just about if you have an hr department so for many of you might only have a handful of employees or you're a manager at a company so if you know entrepreneurs if you have a management or series of managers or leaders in the company i think
(01:03) for them to understand um what the role of human resources and and investing in employees looks like i think it would be valuable so i'm gonna start with a story of hr gone wrong um and then kind of go from there and kind of dissect it as like a little mini case study uh or to the best of my ability and so um to expound upon the many lessons and failures that i have had uh in running the business um a few a year or two ago um we had an hr uh director and uh they i'll just tell you what happened so she had taken upon herself because she didn't have enough work i i know this but she doesn't know this it
(01:49) was because she didn't have enough work and she had overhired she had six people in her department six people in hr can you imagine um six we had a hundred person company like six people like it's just so many people uh so she had a lot of people and no one had any work to do and so um she took it upon herself to do a a salary analysis which is basically a study of how much everyone in the company um you know quote should be getting paid uh based on you know the role their experience what the market's playing and
(02:20) where they live right and um this took like 90 days for her to do this for every single person in the company and so she used up you know a lot of company resources three four five employees etc um for this period of time to do the study uh and the result of the study was that she had determined that you know i don't know 20 or 25 of the company um was being you know overpaid and then 20 or 25 percent of the company was being underpaid and then about 50 of the company was being paid you know appropriately
(02:51) and so the conclusion that she came to was well um i'm going to email everyone and just say uh if you know if if they were being overpaid they were going to stay there because you're not going to give people you know pay cuts if they're adequately paid they'll stay where they're at and if someone's being underpaid uh we'll email them and say hey you just got a raise congratulations right um and so this may have been the single stupidest thing i have ever seen someone do in my entire life um but that was the decision that was made and so um this was reported to me at a uh at a
(03:26) what do you call it a uh at our quarterly and this was actually her accomplishment for the quarter and i just i just remember just being so so bewildered befuddled dumbfounded um by the fact that that this person this human being had thought that this was a good use of company resources and so i'm going to break down the many reasons why this is not a good idea or this was a terrible thing and then kind of outline what i believe the the ideal role of hr is in a company so the reason this was terrible uh was that um
(04:07) so she literally used company resources probably a hundred thousand dollars of payroll resources to create this solution that then just paid out more money from the company um which is just my wallet it's just my bank account right and just paid out more money for no reason and did it in a way that anybody who got paid more had no explanation for why they were getting paid more and provide no value so she literally wasted money doing it wasted money for that point going forward in the company because after someone gets that email i can just be like oh by the way she was wrong
(04:37) sorry about that and then we're just gonna get keep you back where you were um and so i think the whole thing probably cost me like six hundred thousand dollars in profit right like i mean like more than she was going to get paid for years right and it just seemed like just a small thing like ah just the company right and so this is where you know if you're a manager in a bigger company or you direct rep you know if you report directly to the ceo or the owner you have to understand this right and so um yesterday at our quarterly uh our
(05:07) current hr director uh that drake to our director's not with us anymore uh was bringing up her uh she was kind of giving her uh position on what she believed uh her value to the company was and and i ended up kind of giving a talk about this in general and this so this is uh for my current hr director this is not about our conversation or anything like that but this is just in general for everyone so i wrote some notes down because i think it was really important and so uh one of the things that i hear
(05:38) a lot is my role is to make employees happy all right so i'm going to just hit eat piece by piece your job is not to make employees happy as an owner your job is not to make employees happy as a manager your job's not to make employees happy as an hr director your job is not to make employees happy employees job is to make employees happy human beings are responsible for making themselves happy there are people in auschwitz who wrote books about how they were happy and there are people in america living in the top one percent of earners of the whole world who are
(06:10) miserable and depressed all right your job is not to make people happy people will choose to be happy based on their own beliefs about their circumstances and what their thoughts are um independent from the actual things that are happening to them so first off it is not your responsibility it is your responsibility to try and find people who are going to have a positive inclination who are going to fit in with the culture so that we can keep an atmosphere that does retain and attract talent which is the next thing i'm going to get to but your
(06:40) job is not to make people happy all right number two one of the things i i heard um is that employees are my customer right if you're a manager or you're an hr director like well really you know everyone who's who works here is my customer incorrect that is not who your customer is your customer is the company all right and now i'm gonna be clear about this the company has three stakeholders you've got shareholders the people who own the company you've got uh customers the people who pay the company and then you've got employees the people who run
(07:12) the company all three stakeholders have to be considered now the reason this is an important delineation is that if you have a hr director who is like employees first then you have the type of stupid stupid decision that i just discussed in the very beginning which is literally just paying out profit for no value all right and this is an important point that i need to cover which kind of leads naturally to the next thing is that in order for a company to grow it has to have profit in order for it to weather storms that it does not see that are going to come in the future it needs to have profit to
(07:55) be able to reinvest in new product lines in legal defense in whatever could possibly happen and when you just choose to buy things for no value which is essentially what it is when you just overpay then you put your company in a bad position so let me explain so an investor looks at any kind of asset and a company the assets of the company are the humans right or the or the it's human capital it's the actual value they get from people especially if you're in a service business right and so you have the value is what you get
(08:28) and price is what you pay right and the goal i want to be very transparent about this of the company is to pay as little as possible for as the highest amount of value and that may make people uncomfortable but the point of all businesses is to give to get as much pride they want to have as big of a discrepancy as possible so if i'm an investor and i'm buying stocks i want to buy the most valuable company that i can for the least amount of money right it's a price to value discrepancy right and the bigger that discrepancy the better
(08:59) it is now if it's the reverse you're paying more for less value that is a bad deal it doesn't matter what you're paying it's a bad deal all right and so the reason that that first hr director made such a terrible decision was because she literally just chose to take it literally take our good deals and just say hey we're going to make bad deals now and all of our bad deals we're going to keep as bad deals right it just it just it just it just i it made no sense whatsoever and so that's that is what we're like that is the goal
(09:30) here right and finally when i was talking to our hr director about this she pushed back on this she was um not sorry not her but like you might have you might have an etc director you might have a manager who might push back on this idea and so i just went and the two different two different scenarios came up um that we were walking through and one of them is well you know uh you as the entrepreneur you know you always value the marketing the sales more than the rest of the company uh and i i could see that there was you
(10:02) know some being at odds with that right like i don't know if i agree with that um and i want to be 100 clear i do value marketing sales and product more than operations here's why not that long ago there was a period of time where i had mentors who were like you need to put operations first right this is part of scaling you have to delegate blah blah blah and so there was a period of time where i put operations on a pedestal and was like no guys we need to just do what operations wants us to do and to be
(10:33) clear for definition operations is everything that is non-core to the value of the company all right that is i.t that is hr that is finance that's legal uh all of those comprise operations all right and to be clear about what that means is it's everything that must happen to keep the company running but is not a core value driver for top lane revenue or for customers all right and so marketing brings revenue in product delivers value that is being exchanged for money that's fundamentally what a company does it's got stuff and it sells it right and as
(11:09) long as you're delivering the stuff or you're or you're um or you're selling the stuff that is being delivered those are core value to the company everything else absolutely must happen but um in general they're not the main value drivers now that being said there are ways that those other com those other components can provide value indirectly and that's what i'm going to cover in this because i think being an hr director or being a manager in a company and being in one of those roles if you're clear on that uh you will be more valuable to your owner and if you're interviewing for a
(11:39) position and you talk the way that i'm telling you right now to talk to an owner you will probably get the job and probably stay there because they will know that you understand what you're talking about so the example she said well um you know i feel like you care more about you know sales and marketing and i said yes i do and here's why um and by the way when i did that operational thing and put operations first the company started going down um and we started making less money and it was painful and horrible and i had to basically jump
(12:08) back in and be like i'm so sorry about that that was not a good idea we are keeping the value we provide and marketing and sales primary and operations is secondary to that it is a supporting role so if sales says hey we need contracts uh you know to be changed because this is the new offer or whatever then operations has to say all right we're gonna go figure that out right and that is the point the point is that operations should support and always enable sales marketing and product all right so she said well
(12:38) um i feel like you know you value you know like a star salesman um more than you value like a frontline uh customer service person uh and so she's like you know there was a there was a decision that you know this is this has come up you know a zillion times over the years it's like you know i i think you value these positions more and i always have to unequivocally say i do yes because people people like and i feel like this is i don't want to say an employee thing or it's just like they feel like it's like a bad word for me to
(13:11) be like no no i do care about more about marketing sales and product period period because they are the major drivers of value in the company all right and so um for example if you had chet holmes wrote about this in his book if you have a superstar sales person this is what i was talking about to the to the whole company i was like if you have a superstar sales person and that person you know is being paid quote above market right above market value there's two ways of seeing market value there's market value which is like what is the rest of the market paying for this right and then what am i getting in return for this
(13:49) specific person so for like if you have an all-star salesperson like you may have gone through 20 sales people to find an all-star sales person for your specific company in your specific product right because there are some sales people who who excel in let's say b2c transactional sales all right and there's some who who excel in you know a longer style b2b consultative sales and there are some sales people who excel in account management and kind of upselling and kind of like the farming and continuing to grow an account right those are all sales they're just different and so i could find a
(14:21) salesperson right but that person might not perfectly fit my company and i might not yield the same outcome and so if i have for example somebody who's selling really well and sells three you know sells more than three times uh you know it would take me two or three normal quote normal sales people to replace their production and this is common in most companies most people have multiple sales people there's one person who you know one or two people always like lead the pack disproportionately right and that uh that person right
(14:54) if in in in many conversations this is one of them it's like well if that person came up to you for example and said well i want a 20 pay raise or a 10 pay raise she was like i disagree with that and i was like i think that's stupid that you disagree with that i was like make the economic argument if we lose that person and then we lose half of our sales how can you tell me that was not worth ten percent more on their base salary so well i hadn't thought about like that i was like right you need to think like an owner right you gotta think like an owner what am i losing here right um and
(15:23) to the same degree the the corollary to that uh is like well i feel like you don't value customer service as much like what if we had an amazing customer service role this is kind of like the counter example right like well i feel i feel like you're willing to you know pay these people more than you are willing to pay these people and it's like yes i am because they provide more value and i was like okay i hear where you're coming from what if this person does an amazing job in customer service and i was like i
(15:44) get it so let's say this person disappears tomorrow how much less are we gonna make so probably not a lot i was like right and so if you wanted to you know come to me with a you know customer service person and say this person you know saves x percent of people per month and that results in this much money and the aggregate of adding a dollar per hour example to this person's role still doesn't compare to what everyone else on the team is saving which would be like what i would consider market right like if i just brought some in who's average
(16:18) and this person is way above average let's say this person saves you know 25 percent of the whole team saves is from this one person uh then i'd be like okay well there's a number value to that and uh you know we can incrementally add a certain amount uh that would mean it was worth keeping right uh and i was like but in this example we're talking about if this person stopped and just was gone i was like how much do you think that the company would make less she was like it probably wouldn't change the revenue and i was like right and for that reason
(16:50) that is how market value is established and so for everyone it's like this is the real world all right like i don't i don't know what the the harvard business review you know says about making happy employees and like all this you know whatever hoodoo um but in the real world you get you don't get a trophy all right not everyone's first not everyone makes the most amount of money you get paid based on the value that you provide and a good owner understands that right and so when we you know we were having these discussions um i think that uh it was it was good
(17:24) for our whole company to to understand and see like that's the point here like the point is to make a profit the point is to pay as little as possible for as much value as possible right and assess the value of the individual based on what they contribute to the bottom line right and so you know to wrap this up if you were you know for for for hr in general human resources it's like well then how do i provide value you provide value by one protecting the company at in all ways all right and the way that you do that is first when people come to you and say hey i
(18:01) want to hire so-and-so your first answer should probably be no give me a reason why your team is so overworked that they can't just work more right show me your hour-by-hour utilization that you have like and i'll tell you right now and i've said it in the past a lot of people don't work that hard all right and a lot of people will say that they are overworked because they literally do not understand what work is all the time i know this for a fact there's some of you listening to this right now who spend your entire day not
(18:32) working trying to work spend all day getting [ __ ] all done because you're in your head and you literally have an inability to focus that is not a company's fault that is your lack of ability in being disciplined and learning the skills of learning how to work like you have to get you just have to you have to get things done you know and so many people don't get much done in their whole day and then say hey i need help when it's really like they aren't actually overworked they actually just don't know how to work right and mind you this is not this is a
(19:07) lesson that i learned because i was younger once and i started working at a law firm as an intern and i remember a senior partner jokingly said to me she was like you don't even know what work is yet she's like you haven't even learned how to work and i and i was like offended um but then i saw how hard these people worked and lawyers worked there you know in in hardcore law firms they worked their asses off and i was like huh she's probably right right and i started observing the habits of people work more and how much more they got done
(19:39) so anyways um point is is that people will come and try and hire for help when there really isn't it's not necessary and so that does not protect the company it also doesn't protect the employees because if the company's at risk everyone's at risk right so you have to put the company first right um and so that's thinking like an owner so that's number one number two is that you have are active in recruiting the best talent all right because everyone knows that the value of the company is going to be based on the value of the people the who not the what right a good who
(20:09) will figure out the what and so really good hr is really good recruitment it's talent right it's finding the talent developing the talent retaining the talent now obviously not all that's going to fall under hr right recruiting absolutely right uh you know developing is going to be more underneath the departments and retaining is going to be a function of really the department heads and then the compensation packages right but the thing is is that i want to be clear here if you and and this is i'm going to wrap this back in the original story
(20:42) when you know the hr director the former hr director did this big salary analysis and she said hey this is our big success we're just paying people more and we got nothing back in value as a company right i was like why did we do this and that's the hard question that you know obviously wasn't able to answer i was like why did you did it because she had nothing to do right but that's actually why she did it but i was like what problem are we solving here what was the objective of this the answer there was none right because
(21:21) the only reason that you would want to move compensation is for one of two things either you cannot attract talent or you cannot retain talent so what i mean by that is like the only reason to really increase someone's pay if they are already working for you is because you value them enough that replacing them with someone else who has a comparable skill set would not the marginal difference would not be like if if the margin difference is huge right then you'd you'd be incentivized to retain them right and you as a company in this hypothetical example
(21:55) have a problem retaining employees we at gym launch do not have that problem we we have incredibly low attrition we fire people like crazy but people don't quit um and that's because we have a really high performance culture like people don't last you know what i mean like it's uh like sorry low performance don't last uh it's i i heard this from grant cardone but i really liked it it's like gym launch is a dangerous place to work like if you if you come in and you get on the train like you will learn more from me
(22:24) and us and running a company and learning how to grow things uh than ever before but uh you gotta perform like this is a winner's environment and if you are a winner you will love it here and if you are not a winner you will not i mean you won't be here very long right because the thing is is when you come if you've ever played on a high performance sports team your whole life at some point or any kind of team that's high performing that was a winning team usually there's a culture that if someone is new and comes in they either assimilate or reject it and the stronger that core team is is
(22:53) like this is how we do it right we wake up at five we go over our scripts we role play we do game day review from the day before on sales calls blah blah blah we you know etc and someone new is like ah man that's you guys are waking up early like i'm not really about that life like like the team will be like dude get this guy out of here like he's gonna take the team down and so having that culture uh allows you to spit people out quickly but it also allows you to retain now this is my point uh earlier which was uh why did this hr manager uh director make
(23:27) this call right and obviously it was because she wasn't thinking right um but there was no problem that she was trying to solve which is i was like this is this was a hard time for her i can imagine because it was in front of the entire company i was like do we have a problem attracting talent it's like no i was like okay so the pay that we are currently offering is we're having no issue finding talented people to work for these positions at these price points it's like no it's like okay do we have a major problem in attrition are we losing employees left and right two competitors who are paying more
(24:05) offering more or that we got head hunters picking off our people she's like no it's like then why did you just choose to spend 600 000 a year more of bottom line profit why and the answer she had none right and so it's making sure that we understand the why we're doing things right the point of the company is to buy value at the lowest possible price that is the point i don't care what anyone else says that is the point all right you're going to try and pay for the value as little as you can because that discrepancy is where the profit is right just being
(24:47) real that's where the profit is you need to have a discrepancy in order to have a profit so that the company can continue to run right that's what it is and so anywho uh i share the story at the beginning because that is you know one of a zillion failures you know in lessons that i've learned along the way in this in this game and um you know if you have a star employee i think a lot of times it is worth paying them more to keep them because you get like everyone knows if you have a star employee they're usually worth like three or four employees five employees in output right i'm probably worth a lot of employees in
(25:24) output in terms of top line revenue this business so i get disproportionately paid is it fair i think yes it is fair i think you should always be compensated based on the value they provide i think that's the ultimate fairness i don't think it's like oh he's a human i'm a human we should get paid the same thing that doesn't make sense to me all right so i want to make sure i hit all my points making employees happy is not your problem it is their problem it is their responsibility now you can equip them with tools and skills about mindset and whatnot but like ultimately the
(25:53) accountability of who needs to make who happy you need to make yourself happy a job is not supposed to make you happy because there are people who are endlessly happy in quote terrible jobs and they're people who have amazing jobs and kill themselves so it has nothing to do with you number one number two your employees are not your customers all right your company is always your customer number one because the company balances the priorities of everyone the shareholders the customers and the employees all right um i'm a quote middle man between the employees and ownership that is not true
(26:24) you protect the company all right these are false beliefs these are not true all right um you know undervaluing uh people who are not value pro uh you know top line value providing right they're not delivering on on on the value that we're selling or selling the value right that's those are fundamentally what a company does we sell value and then we deliver on on the promise that's it right and if you're not in one of those core things um unless you can make an argument for how you were directly providing value then you will probably get paid less and that's okay and that's okay
(27:00) right fundamentally thinking about all employees as units of value and ascribing a price to them right which is what you pay them and trying to always understand that you're always going to try and pay as little as you can for the most amount of value right that is and that's okay that's that that's okay that's the point right the only reason that you would pay more is if you have trouble attracting or retaining people if you're not having any issues or attracting or retaining people then you're paying fine
(27:30) right like you don't need to change the cop and so finally um that is what i will lead you with or end you uh or leave you with in this role of hr and my many many lessons along the way um i hope you enjoyed this and click subscribe and all of that good stuff but uh i have i have some passion with this because it's i've made these mistakes so many times and i've seen these mistakes made on my behalf and so if you're a manager if you're an hr director take this to heart you work for the company the company is your only customer
(28:10) and your responsibility is to protect the company just like everyone else's responsibilities to protect the company and if you can think like that you will think like an owner and you will move up in your company if you live in a la la land of i'm supposed to just buy bean bags and have you know and and keep employees happy um one you're going to waste money two you're not going to know what actually provides value in a business and three if you're in a different company what may happen if you don't have like a candid owner or whatever who wants to
(28:41) like talk real with you um they'll just kind of like put you in a corner right and then just be like oh yeah yeah yeah you bet yeah yeah go do that little initiative um but they won't actually see you as valuable uh because it means because you don't get the game like you don't get it you have to understand it um and then people like you'll you'll get into the in circle i'm trying to say this the right way you've probably had people in your life where you've got you've got your friends right um and you're like
(29:16) she gets it or he gets it right you talk to your friends like nah she gets it right she gets how this like how we see the world right the thing is that most business owners see the world the same way and that's why they are the owners of the business and that's why they started the business and that is probably how the business has grown and so it is in your best interest to align with the company overall because a good owner will put the company first not themselves because ultimately they the company feeds them the company is the goose the company is the is the is
(29:47) the is the beast that feeds everyone it is the thing that plows the field it is the mule that everyone is fed off of and so we have to keep the meal healthy and that is by having the discrepancies and making the hard conversations and making the hard calls and being real with you which is what i'm hopefully trying to do right now which is that is the point all right um so anywho uh i hope that was valuable for you i hope that made sense hopefully you don't have to to pay the many lessons uh and failures that i have and uh if you have a hr manager or a manager
(30:16) who you know hires and argues for compensation things like that send this to him i think it's valuable so anyways lots of love catch you soon [Music] [Music] [Applause] you

Why entrepreneurs stay broke and sad [trigger warning] - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on mosey nation in this video this is a hot take uh that i had when i was uh very very fed up with the amount of people who are failing at life in business um and this is one of the top 300 videos that i released into a private uh community that i had for uh three or four years that were not public um and so i wanted to share the share kind of the best of that community and uh this one was entitled i have the tiger and sustained victory and it was i think a a my chat mind set and perspective shift that will
(00:33) provide significant value to you and i think it will be worth the uh the investment of time to get the the return from it and so uh if you're new to the channel by the way my name is oxford music i iowan acquisition.com it's a portfolio of companies so it's about 85 million a year all right so i make this channel and i make these videos because a lot of people were broke and i don't want to be one of them and so that is why i try and share the lessons and the failures that we've had to get to this point because
(00:56) i think that a lot of people can be more successful if they just had a couple of different tools and frameworks to see the world so lots of love and enjoy the video what i wanted to talk to you about today was i have the tiger so i just had our like a three-day mastermind type thing with the top sellers so two of the three gyms who came here were over seven figures and the other one is gonna probably hit it within the next three months um so it's really it was great because it was a really higher level conversation that i might typically have
(01:23) with i'm entrepreneurs which is fun what we talked about was kind of more amorphous but i think it's incredibly valuable and i think it's probably the the one thing that sets apart the guys who are really winners slash gals who are really winners and the ones who aren't and so it's really just around hunger what i mean by that is recently i had some of our some of our older og gym lords who've been a while you know i mean they they they turn their gym around they've grown they're you know you know close to seven figures or right around there and
(01:49) they've been doing it for a while and they were complaining about show rates they're like hey our show rates are low and um you know you go through the same well you're doing the reminders are you doing all this stuff like yeah we're doing all this stuff okay cool and i dig a little bit deeper and i look and it turns out that they're only open one hour per day at 7 15 a.
(02:09) m for their availability availability for for new clients and i'm like how the [ __ ] do you think that you're going to grow your business if the only time that you can take new customers is that 7 15 am in what world does that make sense right like imagine a grocery store that's only open from seven to 7 30 because that's when it's convenient for the owner what chance do you think that that that grocery store has at succeeding virtually none and so what happens is people have success they implement tactics they use gym watch and then they
(02:43) make money right and then what happens they get comfortable they get complacent right and they lose their hunger like after that point everything like it's almost like i was gonna say like after you after you've like quote made it in your mind and that's what's funny is that making it in some people's mind is like having 10 grand in the bank account so like it's scary in terms of what level of making it is but like once people have made it i almost want to say like none of these tactics matter because you're just not hungry like it
(03:09) doesn't matter like the obvious [ __ ] you aren't doing you know what i mean if your child was going to die or your spouse or your sister together your family member whatever it was was going to die unless you succeeded unless you got more clients unless you made more money with your gym how would you approach it right would you only be available for one hour a day would you only be available from seven to eight a.
(03:34) m would you only set aside an hour a day to prospect for new customers would you only reach out to your customers if they hadn't shown up for a month sometimes people ask questions that they already know the answer to it's like duh no [ __ ] right and and and it goes back to the the main thing which is like what drives you right like what drives you what drives you to be better what drives you to continue to want to win i was asked that question yesterday by the the gym words that were here and i think honestly it comes from a dark place and i think i've said this before
(04:03) but like i'm saying it again because i think people need to hear it sometimes you have to wonder like why is it that only when someone else's life is on the line do you then actually try right like why is it only then you actually cut all the noise out of your life and then would go laser focused on actually succeeding like why can't we do that all the time right like why can't we do that because it's like well then i wouldn't be happy whatever right like whatever happiness means right and so the people who are the most successful in the world
(04:35) are driven by something that is deep inside of them that it's normally an insecurity or a fear of some sort if you're only trying to make enough to live on you will always only make enough to live on and you will slack the moment you get comfortable and you will wonder why is it that as soon as i start making money i stop because you actually don't want to make more that's why you actually don't want to make more and so your internal motivation is not there like because you've accomplished what you set out to accomplish the real
(05:09) question is do you actually want what you claim to want do you actually want it because if you did you'd already have it you'd already you'd already be willing to sacrifice other things in order to achieve it and that might mean like maybe waking up earlier maybe like working 4 to 8 p.m to take sales appointments or whatever that thing is it's just the obvious [ __ ] like if you were coaching you what would you recommend you to do right like a lot of times if you think about like you most of the time know what
(05:38) to do like you do on some level like you probably know that you're like man i do stupid [ __ ] sometimes right you probably think that on some level sometimes right then you're like man if i were if you could step out of yourself and say i need to coach myself you probably have the answer and it's just that you don't do it for some reason and so all of your attention should be on that reason why is it that this thing has prevented me from doing the things that i already know i should do like this last mastermind that i had
(06:05) for the top sellers was really interesting for me because it was the first time that i had no one who had extra [ __ ] i didn't have any like everyone there had really like clean lives outside like really focused and just focused on doing the things that were gonna grow their business the conversations are actually really easy and very direct most times it's like okay well here's the obvious hole in your business but you're not doing anything about it so let's attack why you're not doing anything about it right and so then i
(06:34) have to spend the next hour and a half digging into why they're not doing anything about it which has much more to do with how they manage their head space and how they manage their relationships and how they manage their you know and because what ends up happening is they start focusing on their business their personal life goes to shambles they then are like oh my gosh my personal life is going to shambles i need to stop paying attention to my my business they go to pay attention to their personal life and
(06:54) then the gym explodes right it's just this consistent cycle because they just don't know how to just do both or they don't know how to prioritize those all this to say like it's just like how hungry are you like how willing are you to put in what you need to achieve like and if you're not then that's cool then just to stop stop saying you want it you know i mean just be like i only want to make ten thousand dollars a month that's it it's like cool then just say that and be good with it rather than constantly complaining about
(07:22) how you're not because you're not even willing to do the things that that you already know you should do like right now i get on the phone the gym owners are like i know i should work my leads harder i know i know i should go through the sales trainings more like i know i should you know go through the portal i know i should i know i should meet with my team more i know i should pour my like then why aren't you why aren't you like why like why like i know like i know you have time because other people have time and have the same business as
(07:46) you so you have time so why aren't you because once you have the tactics right and this is one of the biggest the freeing and also most soul-crushing parts of gym launch is that once once once the gym owner joins gym launch you know how to make a seven-figure gym you know how to do it and so then it reflects back onto you it's like oh [ __ ] i'm the reason that we're not there and you have to swallow that right because up until they go to gymlodge people been doing it for five years seven years eight years and they're like i don't
(08:15) know how and then once they see how then they're like oh [ __ ] i'm not sure if i'm willing to do that it's like cool once they know that there is no secret there is no hack it's literally like uh microphones uses the term chopping wood like i call doing the boring work it's like it's chopping what it's reps it's day in day out you got to reach out to people you got to give great service write the handwritten cards like remind people to weigh in you have to work the leads when the person comes in the door you have to be
(08:41) enthusiastic you gotta greet them with a smile you have to ask the same questions over and over and over again because to that person is the first time they've ever heard and it doesn't matter if it's the hundredth time that month you asked the same questions to that person to that person's day one and so if you were trying to be successful do you think that only having availability for sales appointments at 7 15 to 7 45 in the morning once a day is going to get you the optimal outcome do you need a coach to tell you that
(09:08) really you know what i mean like really and and so like or or there was another one that i saw that was like between 9 a.m and 11 am that was their availability hmm good luck with that that's when that's when the people who have the most money are available right nine to one during the week we know what to do right anyone who's in our world like you know what to do it's just you have to figure out why you're not doing it right and then tack that because the tactics aren't the thing anymore right the tactics are
(09:37) there you can read a book and give it away for free right like you can do that but like figure out why you're not hungry figure out why you're not tr like why you're not trying like just figure it out like there might be something inside maybe you don't want more and like you need to discover that it's like okay then like now you know but like if you claim to want more and yet you can't do what's necessary to get more then that's where your attention should go and you should figure that out because otherwise it doesn't matter what
(10:06) tactics there are you're just not going to do them anyways so what's the point so anyways it was incredibly refreshing to have the three guys who were out here uh we had ed turner uh mike great phones so both of those guys have been over you know seven figures uh run rates for a while and doing really really well those guys were just like what do i need to do like because they're like they're clear eyes you know toes forward know exactly what to do and i was like why is it that these meetings are so much easier than some of the
(10:30) other meetings i had and so we've probably spent a little bit of the day kind of digging into that and um it's just a question how bad you want it i really think that's it and like figuring out why you're not doing what you already know you should do in order to achieve it like do you need to go pay someone a bunch of money in order to then get motivated i don't know like hopefully your kid doesn't need to be kidnapped in order for you to get motivated about your business hopefully right and so it's like what what is that
(10:56) thing for me it's just fear it's just fear and insecurity it's fear failing fear of not being good enough fear of people who hated to be right you know what i mean that's what my fear and so i just like that's what drives me it's not about money like it couldn't have been about money because i don't need any more for the rest of my life at all it's like it can't be about that but if it is like about that for you and you feel like when you make your first twenty thousand dollar take a month your first forty thousand dollar take a month your first
(11:19) fifty thousand hundred thousand dollar take a month the first time you hit that like if that's where you're like oh and you feel this big sigh of relief then your motivation is not coming from the right place i'm telling you straight up if you feel relief when you make a lot of money one month your motivation is not coming from the place of a champion if you want to be the best in the world at something that's not going to do anything for you you shouldn't feel anything from that you feel nothing really because it's not about that
(11:48) that's just that's just an output that's an output from internal efforts and should be focused more on the internal efforts and all of the deficiencies that you probably had and still hitting 100k it's like oh my gosh if we hadn't done this this and this we would have been less right and if we had done this in this we would have been more like that's what you're focusing on and you're only focusing on those things and um if you can do that then you'll be able to unlock something inside of you that's much stronger than
(12:15) what might currently be driving you anyways guys hope you have an amazing uh saturday drop a like if you feel like this is cool drop a comment if you feel like it was cool if you don't then that's cool too anyways guys have an amazing day and i will catch you guys soon hopefully that was valuable for somebody who is on the fence who's like not sure about why they can't achieve what they want why they can't be consistent it's because your motivation is not coming from the right place right you're just trying to make enough money to live
(12:38) on and the moment you make enough money you stop working and then you wait for things to blow up again until you try hard again how many times all right i'm going to a second little rant how many times have you needed to make money and then immediately made the amount of money that you needed in like a day in like a week right you need to make payroll i gotta make 10 grand the next three days how do how many times has that happened to you and you always make it work why because you already know what the [ __ ]
(13:04) to do right you just choose not to do it you choose not to do it you choose not to make money when you know how to make money because whenever you need to make money you make it and so that's what you have to attack you have to figure out why when you already know how to make money you don't do it that is the the summary of this entire this entire talk that i was trying to get out of myself is like you already know how to do it when you need to do it you do do it so why aren't you doing it that is what you need to focus on and if you can conquer
(13:32) that piece no amount of money in the world will satisfy you and that is what's going to unlock your ability to become greater and for you to build your business to something that is much greater than yourself because if the only thing that you want to satisfy is you you're going to stay this small i'm going to say this big because to satisfy a single person or a single family doesn't mean a lot right but if you want to satisfy a community you want to satisfy a state you have a satisfying nation you want to satisfy an entire group of people it has
(13:58) to be bigger than you and um and so yeah so anyways uh hopefully that might have resonated with somebody and if it didn't then um i apologize for the extra aggressiveness on this saturday morning um but anyways drop a like drop comment and uh lots of love and i'll catch you guys on the flip side all right

I Ranked the Best Superbowl Ads 2025 [TIER LIST] - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npi7UeOE_0o

Transcript:
(00:00) so Super Bowl ads are 8 million bucks each now the big question is is it worth it and what can you learn from them as a business to improve your advertising I'm Alex rosi I acquisition. comom I've run millions of dollars of ads and today I'm going to tear up the ads at the Super Bowl across 6 key factors to determine whether it was a touchdown or fumble isn't that cute cute little analogy touch down or fumo first up Google take it away so at my last job I was working across several different groups um you know what let me practice that one again okay when you're ready tell me
(00:31) about the job that taught you the most okay well it was a role where I learned to take constructive criticism I think she like oh no doesn't like it okay I got pretty used to you know working long hours with a small team I got very comfortable uh multitasking and I had to become really organized not bad but try rephrasing your answer to sound more confident right right okay I was asked to make a lot of quick decisions and do a lot of negotiating one more book talk about your experiences working with others oh Dad well I'm at my best
(01:13) when I'm collaborating if it's for the team I'll do whatever it takes this job description you shared mentions on the job training well I am a fast learner I don't always have all the answers but to get the job done gas no matter how long it takes and I'm not afraid to admit when I'm wrong but most importantly I show up every day no matter what all right last question when it comes to work what motivates you there she go I guess knowing that people can depend on me [Music] and knowing I can depend on them
(02:09) [Music] too that's a great answer sounds like you're [Music] ready hey James thanks for joining us it's good to see you all I've been looking forward to talking so real quick what we're going to be ranking these on is did it grab attention uh did it make you care did it sell the dream did it create urgency did it show social proof and most importantly did it tell you what to do next this ad I think was exceptional honestly I think it was exceptional for a number of reasons the first is that they draw this really you know very sentimental story arc was almost like the up movie where you get the whole
(02:45) love story in you know 2 minutes at in the movie this was basically that just done in like 30 seconds but they were able to weave in product demonstration and usage throughout the entire thing which I think made it incredibly compelling in terms of what to do next at the end I mean they tell you about the product but I think what they really drive is uh sentiment uh with this ad which is that I think a lot of people would be like I resonate with any one or many of those slides because either you've been the kid you've been the adult you've been the one for the job they actually cut a lot of different
(03:14) audiences by showing all these very human experiences and they've done it they did it super well in terms of proof they're literally demonstrating in terms of urgency I don't think it would be on brand for them to create urgency so I would knock them for that it's just very direct response and so big picture the Google G Gemini ad I think I'm moved to s tier I think it was exceptional I haven't seen the rest of the ads but I'm I'm bullish on the start I know so ad number two is ramp.com hey should we
(03:36) pull saquin off the field right now to submit his expenses you better not say [Music] yes switch your business to ramp.com so this was a short ad obviously what is this 15 seconds so they probably spent four or 5 million for this ad instead of the full 8 for 30 unless it was 8 for 15 somebody can fact check me anyways I think the hook was contextual to the audience that was watching which was a football player right and so that made sense question based hook around pain fundamentals and I'm a big fan of this and I think not a a lot of business
(04:10) owners do this but it's demonstration they start with a pain based hook of what it's like to not have the product and then they just immediately solve it with having the product through demonstration I mean if you're talking about 15 seconds to get a point across I think it was a pretty effective ad I probably would have done more with the end screen personally and I probably would have said switch your business to rather than have it just be audio main reason is a lot of people are you know watching TV from afar they don't have uh you know subtitles on so I tend to be over indexed on text personally but
(04:41) that's just my own opinion I would put that as an a I think it was a good ad so ad three is booking.com let's run it with hotels and vacation rentals booking.com has something for everyone she you got Boutique we we wee right this way now we're talking what about something more family friend L maybe a resort with a water park or somewhere less family friendly yep one Vegas hotel for the bride to be what if we hate everything we have free cancellation find exactly what you're booking for booking.com booking personally not a huge fan of it
(05:19) it felt super tvisha TV but it felt like an old ad like it was a new it's obviously it's a new ad but like obviously the Muppet are an old brand but it just felt like 2005 television that's just that's that was my initial impression they tried to demonstrate the use cases I think the humor wasn't like super funny and so I think I had a more difficult time of being like Oh I'm this Avatar personally and so I probably would have done this at completely differently uh if it were me I probably would put this I don't
(05:50) know if I want to use up a d d all the way I'll probably I'm going to put this as a c put this as a c I didn't like starting with booking.com that's what the first thing you see is booking I don't know what that is yet they hint at some pain I had a harder time because the cuts were Cuts were fast but weren't explanatory like I didn't know where we were going just felt super mid like compare that to the Google ad it's like like I what are we even talking about like I feel like it's not even close so ad number four from Doritos is made from a fan contest I'm actually really pumped
(06:18) to watch this one aliens Det come on man Dorito Dorito yeah all right I like this ad uh what's really interesting is that there's no basically no words which I find uh great so this is all like creative if you want to think about from that perspective if you think about psychological triggers here though what what they're showing is that something super desired right not only that it's that somebody would literally risk their life in order to keep it but then they they closed the loop at the end and showed that it's actually like peace one person sharing with another so as as
(07:09) much as it's I don't know if it was deliberate or not but there's actually a lot of um kind of like human psychology stuff that's kind of built into this I'm a fan I wouldn't I mean this is very on brand for Doritos which is just like crazy bold right like it's almost like they have a Red Bull brand but for chips so kind of interesting there the way the duritos did this is the way that I would do this uh which is at the end of the day like I'm going to I'm going to we're going to spice up these ads and I'll I'll break down some of the things that I would have considered doing you can't
(07:32) beat data and so like you might have an opinion somebody else might have an opinion but at the end of the day the best ad that's on here is the one that drove the most sales now obviously a big part of that happens with uh past history of brand and so some advertisements have different objectives right a lot of some ads might just be purely branding they want to build positive sentiment of uh positive association between their product or their company and you know the Target demographic or audience some of them just reinforcing the existing position
(07:56) like Doritos is some of them are a pre-ir response ad so I think it really depends the objective but for here from a data perspective if zillions of people already submitted different ads and this one got upvoted the most or shared the most then you already know you have almost like a pre-baked winner and so like when I wrote the leads book which is all about advertising one of the one of the things that I break down in here is if you see this on page 37 and all the way through I did headline tests for the headline of this
(08:24) book and so I could have talked to five people and said hey do you like $100 million advertising or do you like $100 million uh leads or do you like milon promotions you're like $1 million marketing right I could have gone through all of these different notations but instead I just let the data talk what they did was they let the data talk and fundamentally who am I to say one thing is better than another but this was obviously the most viral ad that they they were able to source and here's the even more brilliant part it cost them basically nothing they just let the
(08:47) audience make it for them which is basically crowdsourcing or advertising which I'm a big fan of and one of the great things about building communities which you can check out at school.com so they gave a million bucks for winning but for most of these big ad agencies it would cost them more than a million dollars to to make the ad and not even be sure if it's going to be good or not here they got to spend a million dollars to crowdsource from the best creators out there that obviously love their product and if a customer makes an ad
(09:09) for your product they're going to know it more intimately that anyone will at some Ad Agency where there's a bunch of you know tween trying to figure out like whatever the hell they figure out um this is people who actually use the product and so also as another quick uh side note you might not be the demo so if you when I say demo I mean demographic so like you might not be the target so if some of these ads are like I don't know if this really like ramp might not have like if if you're a business owner ramp makes sense if you
(09:32) don't own a business you probably don't care at all about ramp right and so making sure that we're judging appropriately based on whether we are the avatar for the ad also carries weight so I'm going to give this um I'm going to give this an A so the next ad is Jeep longest thing we ever do is live our lives but life doesn't come with an owner's manual might have been nice huh but that means we get to write our own stories freedom is yes or no or maybe freedom is for everybody but it isn't free it's earned there are real heroes in the
(10:22) world but not the ones in the [Music] movies real heroes are humble they're not driven by pride pride is a terrible driver freedom is the roar one man's engine and the Silence of anothers freedom is the ability to inspire the most sacred thing in life isn't the path it's the freedom to choose it you don't have to be friends with someone to wave at him we won't always agree on which way to go but our differences can be our strength so choose but Choose Wisely choose what makes you happy my friends my family my work make me happy this Jeep
(11:25) makes me happy even though my name is that's my owner's manual how long was his get out there write your own is that whole thing I was like that was super long did they run that whole thing so if Jeep ran a 2minute ad or 2 and a half minute ad then they spent whatever 8 Time 5 which is a lot of of eight time fives right when you're counting in millions okay what I want to do is actually show you what happened in this ad because this is uh this is branding and now there there was such a clear equation that they use that I want to break it down for you so they said Jeep
(12:05) equals Freedom this is literally as clear as day Association as you can make then they said freedom is stuff our demo likes if you like these things you like Jeep and then they just hit thing after thing after thing after thing after thing to be purposeful to curate the associations that they wanted to make with Jeep notice they didn't say Jeep starting at 13 financed for 68 months and 0% APR whatever they didn't do any of that this was a pure brand-based ad there's obviously product placement inside of it which is fine we're trying to reinforce the brand I would say that they're very very specific about the
(12:40) avatars that they're trying to attract and so I would bet you that the things that they chose in terms of the stuff they liked are things that they know from customer research cuz if you're just drop $ 40 million on an ad or whatever they spent the customer research they did I'll bet you they picked the words and things that they knew their demo like now if you watch this I can tell you that this is probably not targeted at women I can probably also tell you that this is going to lean to a more conservative crowd I can tell you this is probably
(13:04) people who are more Pro military when you're thinking about this like he said Freedom isn't free that's more commonly a a right leaning narrative they probably know their Avatar is more right leaning they know their Avatar and so they made a clear equal sign in terms of what they're about if you like Freedom you'll like Jeep and freedom is all of these things that you like so like Jeep basically and I do think the little quip at the end with Harrison Ford was nice um about it being his last name a little bit of a shot across the bow but
(13:29) fundamentally this is pure brand I think this is a good ad I wouldn't say it's the Google ad I would say it's an a tier was a good ad all right next ad is hin and hers obesity is America's deadliest epidemic this is America 74% of us are overweight and obesity leads to half a million deaths each year why you just have to stop eating Jimmy this is America something's broken and it's not our bodies it's the system welcome to weight loss in America like And subscribe a60 billion industry that feeds on our failure they're medications
(14:01) that work but they're price for profits not patients this is America this system wasn't built to help us it was built to keep us sick and stuck but not anymore him and hers offers life-changing weight loss medications they're affordable doctor trusted and formulated in the USA you get a treatment plan designed by a doctor to fit your body goals and lifestyle you deserve to feel great in your body this is the future of healthcare this is him and hers join us in the fight for a healthier America initial impression uh it's definitely visually jarring obviously because you've got a big stomach that just flaps and you've got
(14:41) weight it's so it's basically a very fear-based hook what was interesting to me is that I've never seen hims and hers as healthc care which is what they said so I don't know if they're trying to shift their brand and that was kind of the goal that they had with this particular ad it did feel a little bit I don't know if to say disingenuous but basically they were like all these medic medications are meant for profit and then they're like take our medication and so that felt very like pandering it just I probably wouldn't have been that strategy so by and large this is a branding based ad but I think this serves as a perfect ju deposition
(15:11) between the Jeep ad which I think was a really excellent ad from a branding perspective and this ad which I don't think hit the mark for me also I didn't see any dream outcome the Jeep ad talks about what people want they want freedom and they they demonstrate Freedom visually in a lot of you know freedom-based occasions here I see a lot of over people now maybe if you're an overweight person you would say oh this that is for me but I don't know how many like they're thin and all of the people who are taking their stuff are not there's a lot of little things that I I wasn't the biggest fan of but I think
(15:40) they would want to also demonstrate that like it works for people who are not overweight but cuz they also do like hair replacement I think they do they do a bunch of other things besides weight loss but maybe glp1 products are just crushing it for them that being said I to to me this was the worst ad I think what was the one that we had at C tier booking yeah I think this one's worse than that um I'll put that as a d cuz the the question we have to ask ourselves is does an overweight person let's just say that they're trying to make themselves more accessible for you know overweight people so then we asked the question okay would it overweight
(16:09) people like well they had a lot of stuff they didn't like but they didn't show a lot of stuff that they did and then they also branded themselves as Healthcare which maybe there's a strategy around that but I think most overweight people hate thinking about how they have health care and like they're sick and fat and all this stuff I will say I'm limited cuz I've never been overweight and so I don't know but yeah my initial impression was not like Yay this is really compelling all right ad seven is on that's a slice oh Mr Roger Federer why does it say q and C on your shoes
(16:40) that's an o and n for on um hm well you know Elma knows his alphabet and and does definitely a Q and A C trust me Elma it's it's on okay but you know Elmo loves you Mr Roger Federer even if you don't know your alphabet yet looks like on right yeah roer I can already tell you what my score is on this one to me it's a c I'll tell you why I think it's a c like I would say the the one before this was I had a bad aftertaste from the last ad this one is just like it has nothing to do with anything besides you have a celebrity endorsement and they're just talking about the letters of the name of
(17:20) the company is this a branding ad right so does it make associations that our target audience like now they might like Federer but the subject matter they're talking about is just like the name of the company and I think they made this ad all about them rather than making all about the customer and I think that's where they missed so I think they just forgot like rule number one is that like no one cares about you they just care about themselves and so I think they they missed the mark there I would say that it wasn't distasteful but I put it
(17:43) as a c at eight Go Daddy let's rip it actors we have the power to convince the world we know what we're doing when in fact we do not I can make you believe I'm a detective without ever stepping foot in an actual crime scene these symbols probably symbolize something astronaut nope Houston I'm observing some debris coming from Uranus am I hardest rooll yet small business owner because I have no idea what I'm doing the GoDaddy Arrow does using AI to build a logo website and social content so I can start Walton goggin's goggle
(18:36) glasses because if your goggles ain't goggin they don't belong on your Noggin with GoDaddy Arrow it's like you know what you're doing so this one I first off I didn't really enjoy the call out cuz it had actors as like almost the call out so to me that like I'm like well that immediately I'm like this doesn't apply to me and then it takes like 2third of the ad of just kind of like demonstrating not knowing what you're doing but really not knowing where it's going at all and then at the very end it's like oh it's GoDaddy which is a hosting
(19:05) site that can help you build your your website with AI I would have just liked real world business owners not knowing how to do many other things and then having this be the one thing that they had figured out how to do right I would have loved to seen like a a a before after with this being like three four five things in a row that a business owner doesn't know how to do insert new amazing thing the GoDaddy hosting and then now they revisit the old things and they can do 1 2 3 4 5 and then recap CTA I think that would have been a far more effective ad and I think the more
(19:35) emotive those five things were the more compelling the ad would have been right so it's like how do I pay payroll like that would be like an interesting thing right now of course you're not going to build a payroll website but there this is me thinking off the top of my head but like there are elements there that you could probably take of business owners like it' probably be like answer my phone the email because they do all of these things on the site so I probably think through each of those elements and just show before born after
(19:59) I'm going to put this in the uh I'm going to put this in the C category I wasn't a huge fan as a as a business owner I wasn't like super compelled also random but like I don't know if small business owners at all care about how actors pretend to know what they're doing and I don't know if you think about this from repairing perspective what they did was they compared actors and small business owners and they equated the two and I think most small business owners probably wouldn't want to call themselves actors now they might
(20:26) have done some research to figure out like look like you know what you're doing and I'll bet you that phrase might convert um but I think they might have taken like a creative team might have taken like who else acts like they know what they're doing actors and I just think that was probably the Miss personally yeah and I'll be clear I think there were a couple elements of humor I think that Noggin and goggin thing was funny I think uh I think the second frame where he did something I thought was kind of cute but while I was watching I like what are we talking about here and so the thing is it has to keep your attention and it it didn't
(20:54) really keep my attention cuz I didn't know like what this is about and this was the only ad we've watched so far far that I had to rewatch to try and understand and if that's what a lot of people had to do then they're just never going to re-watch it and like the moment's gone all right ad n instacart let's shoot it release the hounds Mony baby [Music] I'm on a p this the way we take to the groceries are here thanks babe you get the milk I think we're going to have our first B it's just mid I'll tell you what I think they did well I'll tell you things I didn't I didn't like so I think
(21:45) them showing the actual end result of using the product which is groceries delivered immediately and then her having to go get the cow I think that was the most compelling part of the ad the last like four or five seconds which is good cuz at least it's close to the CTA or at least is at least telling you what the company's about in terms of the the actual ad itself now they probably they might have been able to do some sort of co-op with a lot of these Brands because they're getting you know ads so
(22:08) they might have all chipped in to to do this because think about like this if they help instacart instacart is a distributor of their products and so if they help advertise instacart then it increases the likely that people use instacart to purchase these things so I'll bet you that these specific products will probably see an uptick among instacart users that being said it took me a little bit more than a half second to figure out like what this is about and I also try to think about this from the perspective of somebody who
(22:32) doesn't know what instacart is I know what instacart is but if you don't know what instacart is you're like what the hell is this thing I like a more tactical uh experience for a customer or a prospect to understand what problem this solves I think that's why I think the last 5 Seconds was compelling like oh you forgot milk then you know Rush ordering the milk that was probably the most Salient use case in the ad and so if you have the opportunity to demonstrate that within your own advertising the problem and then the
(22:57) immediate solution being your product I see that as a good thing but I think the first you know 70% 80% of the ad could have been better I like the last five or six seconds so I'll put that as a b all right add 10 nardis breast cancer screening I see you again [Music] at at look at that you get lift you get height you get power your attention please still the show show how you know I'm going to keep on dancing so you can keep on gling it ain't my fault that I was made this way [Music] really let's start paying attention to breasts when it matters the most early detection for breast cancer is a game
(24:02) changer and why I'm able to be here today so let's get more women screen than ever before go to your attention please.com and take the first step big picture obviously grabbed attention I mean I I would say 10 out of 10 on the attention grabbing right like that's evolutionary and so they obviously demonstrate that the whole way through I think that's good they show some pop culture references they show some influencers in there show some actors all that stuff gains attention I'll bet you people were watching this whole thing uh all the way through like I was glued calm down um but you know the tone
(24:34) shift at the end I think basically you have a testimonial which is fundamentally what that is and I do think there's a decent Jos with the with the text there I want to give this a B+ I don't think it's an A but I think it's a B+ I think it was it was an above average ad so they had you know their main point and then they had a CTA at the end I would say the urgencies implied with the fact that like you could have something over 6 million people have this bad thing happen don't be one of them is kind of the implied
(24:58) messaging and I think that's good I mean you could model that ad structure for just about any business basically tons of attention fact that Mak someone uncomfortable testimonial of somebody who avoided it using the service CTA like that's fundamentally we just went through the only lingering question that I have is like it was so fun I wonder if it it leaves you feeling good not feeling like I should go and get my breast screening and so I think that it's like this is something that may get positive accolades obviously cuz who's going to on a breast cancer ad but from a purely advertising perspective the point of advertising is obviously
(25:29) let people know about your stuff but the point of persuasion is to change Behavior right and so I think my larger question is like how many people actually go through with it as a result of this ad compared to maybe an ad that could have been like I think if they had done like the Google Gemini version ad of this where it was like all the moments you're going to miss out on life like probably would have been more compelling second maybe like the Jeep version of like you know boobs are Freedom like free the tatas but then all of a sudden it you know it transitions here's all the things that boobs are great for but then it's just like
(25:59) somebody on a ventilator I think that would have been more compelling to get people to like change Behavior so I will put it as a as a be next one Nike let's hit it you can't be demanding you can't be relentless you can't put yourself first so put yourself first you can't be confident so be confident you can't challenge so challenge you can't dominate so dominating you can't Flex so Flex you can't fill a stadium so fill that Stadium you can't be emotional so be emotional you can't take credit you can't speak up you can't be so ambitious can't break records can't have any fun make demands can't
(26:48) keep scor you can't stand out whatever you do you can't win so when well you know I'm going to be a fan of uh anything that has just win so that's that's Alex's life motto more so that all the difficulties that you go through can be Rewritten with a W you know I'm a big fan of winners right history including your own if you lived your entire life suffering and then at the very end you accomplished what you wanted I think that it would change the entire narrative there's a great story that I heard of a guy who was objectively a failure and they just name all the failures this guy had and the one thing he had is he wrote this little
(27:35) song called Jingle Bells and so like failed musician failed at everything but it's like he won you know what I mean it's like if all of that was in order to have this one Timeless thing that ended up you impacting millions of lives over over the course of history to me that sounds like a w so anyways I'm a fan of Nike's kind of reemergence their new Direction uh this is obviously a branding at their whole brand is so wide in terms of products they sell and they demonstrate the products across lots of different sports here they're associating with each of the people in
(28:07) there each of the Champions objectively like they sign goats they sign people who many consider always the best in the world and sometimes the best of all time and so they're associating their brand with these people whom you like and they're wearing the product and demonstrating what it looks like to win I would say this is a really solid ad obviously targeted at women um since it's all female I'll say this this isn't my favorite Nike ad I'm also not a woman I'll give this an a you got to put your
(28:31) hat on for associations they're saying Nike equals winning and Nike equals doing what people told you you can't do and I think that they would probably want those two associations and Nike equals all of these great ladies that you like and that you admire and look up to therefore to approximate your uh proximity to them you then buy their product to feel that way when you put it on so I think I think it was a successful you know branding Market and they're some of the best marketers I mean if you think about it as a brand perspective I think Nike is one of the
(29:03) Premier in terms of their understanding of of building brand but I'm very happy that they have come back and talked about winning again because uh I think they were touched with a touch of the the wokeism for a minute there and I'm just glad they came back to reality Nike is the the I think is the Roman word for the goddess of Victory if you're going to be a brand built on winning it means there has to be losers you can't say that everybody's a winner and then also have a brand that's about winning cuz if everybody's a winner no one is that is a quote from
(29:32) Flash from The Incredibles the cartoon all right next up rocket morgage this should be interesting let's get you [Music] home West Virginia [Music] blid river life is all there older than the trees younger than the mountains like a yeah can't wa to get there man country home to [Applause] the m baby home Country Road Take Me Home Country Road super good ad so they they have basically I would say a combination of
(30:43) like three quarters Google Gemini 25% Jeep and just made it and so fundamentally let's let's let's walk through the associations here right I would say this is an A+ but not s tier and I'll explain why so let's just walk through the associations really quickly so they have what I would call uh Humanity human moments that many people associate with and/ Americana all right which is just basically the American ethos and so they basically have this big they they basically build this huge storyboard of of the American ethos right the American dream they talk about the military going home different parts
(31:19) of the US different Subs segments they clearly lean a little bit more in the direction of first-time homeowners at least that's what I read you know when I when I look at this ad I think mostly firsttime homeowners now they may find out that getting them getting first-time homeowners then creates the lifetime value of the customer so that might have been deliberate I don't know the only knock I have on this ad is that the CTA was so short at the end that I didn't know whose ad it was so basically it's
(31:44) like they they basically spent the whole time listing all the things that were amazing that i'm like I agree with all of this in the last like 1 second just it says rocket.com on the screen and I have to be paying attention to know rocket.
(32:04) com and to know it's a mortgage company so that's that's the that's why this isn't S tier in my opinion like Google like what separates this from Google Google I think had the exact same level of narrative emotionality sentiment except they were demonstrating the product throughout the entire ad you knew it was a Google product they showed them using it whereas here it was much more morphous and more difficult to figure out what it was about I do think the ad overall though would win the awards of the feels and only after the fact people be like oh I love that ad but they might have now positive sentiment towards rocket it's possible I just don't know how many people watched
(32:32) it was like oh I like this ad but didn't know who the ad was kind of attributed to so by and large really strong ad very and obviously this will only resonate with people who resonate with the American dream but if they're advertising it here during the Super Bowl Super Bowl is almost as American as apple pie right it's it's it's the right time to have an Americana message and I will say that what the part that I probably liked the most was they had a very strong link to the American dream so they said said own the American dream and so that was the only like I would say tie like if we had words own owning
(33:04) a home I would say that was the the word that would link all of that to you know mortgages but otherwise I would say that it was an A+ not s tier yeah if you like this kind of like uh breakdown of some of the brand um I have a whole keynote on how to reverse engineer and create your own brand and understand the elements that create Association how to strengthen them how to broaden them um how to gain influence reach um and ultimately directionality which are the three elements of brand if you're like I
(33:34) don't know what that is you definitely need to watch the video enjoy

2 Signs That You Will Become Wealthy One Day.. - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:01) in this video i'm going to give you two ways to identify how wealthy someone else is going to be in the future and how you can align yourself with those individual character traits all right if you don't know who i am my name is austria moses i own acquisition.com it's a portfolio of companies there's over 100 million dollars a year and i make these videos because i actually enjoy doing it all right so that being said this came from a conversation that i was having with a good friend of mine he exited his company for just under half a billion
(00:24) and we were just having like a philosophical conversation around you know what is it that makes people successful and what are kind of the things you can identify early or mindset shifts in terms of perspective that allow people to have an unfair advantage and so if you followed any of my stuff i talk a lot about time i talk a lot about money and so it's unsurprising that the two traits um have to do one with time and the other with money and so one of the things that's interesting about this is the concept of measuring sticks a lot
(00:50) of us have these base units that we measure things in and it's kind of like shorthand that you use in your brain so i'll give you a simple example so when i was in high school i used to measure you know how much money something was by the amount of chipotle burritos i could buy and because i used chipotle burritos because it was an understandable like quantity of value for me and so everything was like how many chipotle burritos is this and that was because that was like the amount of money that i was making and that was a material
(01:14) amount of value for me at the time and so one of obviously the measuring sticks that people use is uh is is in money and so the bigger the people that you hang around with the bigger the unit of money that they will measure things in in terms of like base units and so for you uh over time you want to increase what that base unit looks like so you want to start measuring things like how many 10k units there are how many cars is this how many houses is this how many businesses is this right and even just the amount of money itself how many 10ks
(01:44) how many 100ks how many how many millions there is and just as a as an aside here in wall street in the hedge fund world they have a term that i learned probably a couple years ago which is a stick right and a stick is their measuring unit which is a million dollars so they're like yeah give them a stick or put two sticks in and they say that because they have these measuring units that are significantly bigger than most people can fathom or imagine but because our brains think in units and so if you can hang around people whose base
(02:11) unit of measurement around money is far greater than yours then you will start chunking up and thinking about money in those greater terms and all of a sudden for example let's say your base unit of money is a hundred thousand dollars or ten thousand dollars even then it makes it much less likely for you to go participate in an activity right that's going to generate you a hundred dollars or a thousand dollars because it's not even a full unit of measurement so it's like almost why bother and what happens and the difference between rich dads and
(02:39) poor dads and what they teach their kids is that rich dads in general will teach their kids to go after higher leverage opportunities they'll go after opportunities that have bigger base units of measurement bigger base units of money that they can compile together right and so the first thing you can do in terms of identifying in other people and then also within yourself is what unit of measurement do they use are they using chipotle burritos right are they using thousand dollar units are they using ten thousand dollar units are they
(03:06) using million dollar units right so the bigger the unit of measurement they're using for money likely the wealthier they are and the wealthier they become because they only will participate in activities that can be measured in those units so that's number one number two is measurements around time and so this is uh and this is has an interesting kind of like part a and part b to it so part a is that they uh on a micro scale within like day to day they're going to act faster they're going to uh be better utilizers of their time in general and
(03:37) on the micro side it's just about speed it's about execution speed if you start interacting with somebody and their speed of communication is rapid in terms of their turnaround time in terms of when they communicate with you in terms of how they respond to things you can be sure that that person is far more active and i'll give you a reason for why people move forward so much faster in life when they have that you're trying to get something done right and let's say that you you message someone and then you know they wait a day and they
(04:01) message you back and then you wait a day and you message them back and then let's say it takes five interactions like this to to get this project done so that would be ten days like you one day then one day five times right and so that would be 10 days now imagine a different scenario where you have two people who are wealthier in terms of how they manage their time right how they leverage their time and they're able to have that entire exchange within a matter of 30 minutes right and now if you look at the difference between a 30
(04:29) minutes and 10 days it dramatically compresses the time to achieve the result and then this is where it gets interesting now after that 30 minutes let's say they do that again and again and again and again in a very real way they will have accomplished more literally in a day than other people will try and accomplish in a month or more right and this is how you compress time and you can drag your future into the present by increasing the speed with which you take action and you communicate with other people all right
(04:57) so that is the part a micro uh for time now part b of time is macro and so this is an important one when it comes to measuring sticks and also again with the measuring sticks on the first one because i really just want to drive this point home i made a video about this but it's it's the idea of switching from end of week being your default to switching to end of day or right now being your default so how can i just make the default in my company end of day like if no one says anything it has to be done by end of day right or how can i say
(05:26) that my new default is by four hours from now right and so that becomes your new micro measuring step in terms of how quickly you can get things done and reply and move things forward et cetera so you want to deal with people who have very condensed micro push things forward in terms of their activities and how they see things getting done on the macros perspective it's when people are talking about decades and not days right and so you can tell how wealthy someone is by their perspective on time in terms of how long they are willing to wait to
(05:56) see something through and so this is kind of like a very extrapolated version of the marshmallow test if you've never heard of that it's pretty famous test where they have two kids and they they said hey you can have a marshmallow now or i can give you two marshmallows in a few minutes and the kids who said i want the marshmallow now and couldn't use the self-restrainer self-control were significantly less wealthy less successful later in their lives compared to the kids who could wait for the second marshmallow
(06:19) and if you wanted to add an interesting wrinkle to this you could make the marshmallow even further out what about if the marshmallow was in five hours what if the marshmallow was the two marshmallows for tomorrow what if the two marshmallows were a week from now what if the two marshmallows were a year from now right and i can guarantee that the person who had the furthest out date of when they were willing to restrain themselves would be significantly more successful and that is because impulse control or self-restraint is one of the
(06:41) key drivers of success because you can see where you're trying to go and it takes from a macro perspective a long time to build amazing things right rome wasn't built in a day which is a quote that is said all the time but people don't actually live by it and so if you surround yourself with people who use measuring sticks of money that are significantly larger than yours they have micro units of time that are significantly shorter than yours they get things done faster they communicate faster they move things forward faster
(07:07) right and then in terms of how they measure the goals that they want to achieve in their life they measure in decades instead of days or weeks or months if you surround yourself and you give yourself those three which is two with you know two with two micros uh if the lens is through which to see other people and then also to judge yourself you will be significantly better off and you will move far more rapidly towards the goals that you want to achieve and so anyways this was a this was a paraphrasing a conversation i
(07:32) had with a good friend of mine um i thought i would share it with you guys because you guys are awesome and i'm just so grateful that you guys enjoy this stuff uh please you know let me know in the comments if there's other things you'd like me to kind of outline and uh if you uh do like this stuff like subscribe share um it uh it helps the youtube gods uh share it to more people so anyways keep being awesome as a nation love you and i'll see you guys next video bye

How I Wrote A #1 Bestseller with $0 and No Publisher - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) my last book 100 million dollar offers just crossed its one year anniversary it sold over 200 000 copies with no publisher no advertising campaign I launched it before I had an audience it is Alex from other here it was truly off of Word of Mouth just launched a brand new book it's a 100 million dollar offers 100 million dollar offers and so people read the book and shared the book you need to create Grand Slam off if people aren't sharing it on their own then it's not worth promoting because it's not good enough I think that when I
(00:27) die the thing that I will be most proud of is not the businesses that I've built but the books that I've written I think the books will outlive anything else and I think that they will help more people that's why I spend right now about 20 to 25 hours a week every week on my book most authors pretty much only do that they're right for four or five hours a day and then they end their day for me I write for four or five hours then I start my day and so I wanted to do one Deep dive video into my writing process
(00:49) the most powerful ability in the world to influence other people is the ability to tell stories that's because you can both educate and entertain with stories it literally changes people's brain waves when they're listening to a story and they become more suggestible so I'm going to break down the elements of Storytelling how to edit a story to make it better how to increase the stakes that make it interesting to a reader and how to do it in such a way that you're actually breaking someone's beliefs that you can actually influence how they
(01:13) behave and once you have that ability you can use it to sell you can use it to educate you can use it to teach to reshape someone's beliefs you can change someone's character you can give skills like there's endless ways and it's the most effective way to communicate to other people that there is if you want to write a book the way that I outline these things is what's the point of writing this book to begin with what is the problem that I'm solving the vast majority of books that are written right now are not written because they want to
(01:38) serve the audience they're written because the author wants to make money from the book accolades whatever most books are not worth reading when writing and Publishing a book became easier was about the 1960s from that point going forward the amount of books that were published you know has exploded 1.6 million books are written per year the reason people publish has changed but I believe that great writing comes from a place of wanting to add to the body of knowledge and when you do that then it allows to compress five years into three
(02:03) hours or four hours for somebody and that's where a book becomes valuable next is kind of like how do you come up with a big idea and then after that I'll talk about the editing stuff from a big idea standpoint this is what actually takes me the longest period of time which is narrowing down the focus of the book to a single problem to be solved I have to answer the question very truthfully what do I want someone to get from this book the first book offers is people don't know what to sell and so that's the first problem somebody has
(02:24) before they can make money is they have to know what they're actually going to sell someone which is the offer and so that's why I started my book series there the next problem is they don't have anyone to sell it to they need leads and so the idea is that when someone's going to meet somebody else I have to think like where does my book come out in the wild just saying like oh I read this great book you should read it some people read that but where I think it's best is where someone's like dude I wish I had more leads people were
(02:45) like oh if you're suffering from that you have to read this book because now it's a solution to someone's problem the problem with most books is that they don't actually solve anyone's problem because they basically name hundreds of problems and don't completely solve any of them so I would rather very narrowly Define the problem and then solve it completely a good book is a complete solution to a narrowly defined problem and so what is the problem that we're solving and then what are the ways that I would think about solving the problem
(03:07) usually it's going to be three to six big buckets that are going to fit for solving a specific problem once I have those buckets I'm going to think what are the experiences that I've had that have shaped this belief that I have about this like why do I think there are these three to six buckets it's like well this is what happened in this time that's what shaped this part this is what happened this time this would shape that part when I saw the charity event at Arnold Schwarzenegger's home that we were invited to I saw scarcity in action
(03:27) about how are they able to sell these things that were never normally worth more than ten thousand dollars for a hundred thousand dollars there was all these other factors at play and so it was a very good story for me to transfer like why scarcity is important there's lots of different Frameworks for trading stories I will give you the one that has been useful for me you have a setting which is where this is happening you have the character the person who's doing the doing you have the desire which is the thing they want you have
(03:49) some sort of struggle why they can't get it you have some sort of Eureka moment that changes things achieving the Victory and then some sort of resolution they talk about this as the heroes two Journeys but not all stories have errors that have two Journeys but the externally internal and you want to tell both the external is what you can see with your eyes if you were in the room the internal is what you'd have to experience as the person emotionally and see we want to weave both of those together in the story and so someone
(04:12) might have the victory but it might feel empty and so it's like we want to tell both sides of that there's two kind of rules of thought that I use one is I want to use all five senses so I talk about I Smell What I Hear What I see what I can touch how things feel like I could feel the back of the chair against me my back was sore because I've been sitting for hours so I could set the setting that way by kind of describing rather than telling number two is you want to show rather than telling so I'll give an example that Stephen King uses
(04:34) in his book on writing which is a great book instead of saying Cheryl walked in she was his ex-wife he might say something like he struck the spot on his finger that was still bleached from where his wedding ring used to be you show the situation to the reader rather than telling them and that is also true of great copy of great marketing of great ads is that you want to demonstrate rather than saying it well then what details do you include because I could spend an entire book to describe this room but if I just said there was a
(04:59) pelt on the wall and it's made of wood and there was a view of water and pine trees you probably have an idea of what kind of place this is if you want to be selective about the details that you're choosing to call out because otherwise you're just wasting time now if the Pelt that I have on the wall in my mind's eye is a deer and in your mind is a buffalo does it change the story and if the answer is no then we don't need to go in more detail on it you want to be Vivid in your description about the things that matter for me I've always had
(05:26) stories heavily ingrained in book because I want to bring the experience that taught the lesson with it because then it gives context to why the framework that I introduced in that chapter is useful so what makes a story interesting I like to think of it as one main thing which is stakes and struggle I can give you a simple story I was at home I was hungry I couldn't find any food I realized I had my phone and I ordered ubereats ubereats arrived I ate I was satisfied that is a story it's not a very interesting story but it is a
(05:56) story if I tell that same story and I were to say I was hungry I'm a diabetic if I don't eat I could die and there was no food in the house as I was rummaging around my vision started to narrow I started getting cold sweats and I was like am I going to be able to get food before I pass out my family's out of town they're not going to be able to find me and so I started having thoughts about like is this how they're going to find me my body on the floor what are my kids going to think all of a sudden I created stakes in the story The Reason
(06:23) game shows are inherently interesting is that they literally put money on it so that there are Stakes that's why why those exist imagine you were watching a bunch of poker players play and the chips were meaningless like Stakes is what makes things interesting so there was a textbook that my buddy Dr Kashi also sent me to create better ads write better copy and ultimately write things that are more interesting what are the factors of newsworthiness and so if you think about newsworthiness it's just what are things
(06:48) that make things interesting and so there were seven components the more of these components that you can tie into a story The more of a story it is and they literally even talk about stories in the news like what's the story the first one is recency how far away the event was to the thing so if you think about you know hopping on Trends as fast as possible when you're telling stories the recency with which the thing occurred to when you're telling the story makes it more interesting the second one is impact of
(07:10) the event so if there's a story but it has no impact on the reader or The Listener it's going to be limited which is why it's on the job of the author to a select the stories that they're going to tell and then make sure that they're bridging why this is important for you as they're telling the story and then they tie it to the action items especially if you're teaching that you want someone to take as a result of that the third is prominence like if Kim Kardashian sneezes it becomes interesting because of how prominent she
(07:32) is and so if you can involve characters that have prominence in a story then you make the story more interesting in and of itself the next one is proximity so it's close to homeness if you will if I tell you a story of a house that's burning down it might be kind of interesting but if I told you it was your neighbor next door it's probably much more interesting to you if you have an ad and you're marketing to a local market the closer you can get the headline if it says rather than like Baltimore Maryland it says Towson
(07:55) Maryland which is a sub suburb or whatever they're going to be much more inclined to listen to the next thing that makes something interesting is conflict whether that's natural or whether it's between people we're here recording this video and a man with a gun walks in all of a sudden this got way more interesting and so it's because there's conflict there's tension and there's unresolved there's mystery the next one is how unusual is this thing is there something odd or bizarre or unique about this particular situation or story
(08:19) like if you see something that you expect your brain doesn't say oh let's pay more attention to this because it matches the patterns that you expect and see the idea is that you want someone to cast a pattern or expectation on your story and then all of a sudden you shift it and they're like whoa and then their brain will divert resources towards the story because it's not matching the patterns that they already had in their mind which means they needed to create attention to reconcile the conflict between what they expect and what is
(08:41) reality and the last one is the amount of times you can update this is a little bit more around news but it's like how many times can you update someone on the same thing right that's why news stories love giving updates oh we're pressing news right from the crime scene when you're telling a story it might not be always able to do that if you're fixed in a story setting you don't have to have all of these things but if you have two three or you know of these things in one story it makes it a much more interesting story hey guys the much
(09:02) awaited sequel to 100 million dollar offers is 100 million dollar leads it is coming out in the next 12 months realistically probably six months if you want to get on the early bird list because last time we sold out in less than an hour so if you want to get on the early bird list and just make sure that you have a guaranteed copy ready for you four distribution so you're gonna use it in getting more leads in your business go to acquisition.
(09:23) com anywhere and just opt in and then you'll get automatically added to that list that we can send you the link the moment it launches once you have that you have a way to tell a story now it's like okay well then how do I bridge that into a wireframe for a book and so for me my general rule of thumb is that I just put stories in where I feel like it starts to get heavy I want to deliver as much of the things they need to do in their business and right when I start to feel like it's heavy I zoom out and I create
(09:44) a story that creates more context and we dive back in I have my big problem the supporting arguments that lead up to that single thing and then I have the stories about how I learn each of those things to fill in the blanks for that book and then the framework for each chapter now once I had that I have a general idea of how I want to go about solving that problem everyone has different writing processes for me I go as far as I can until I realize that I have a logical inconsistency or an inconsistency with my own experiences
(10:08) that would prove my theory or model wrong at that point this is the part where most people don't want to do it I go back to the beginning I adjust my assumptions and then I restart the book and I write it again and I usually get a little further and then I realize that something is wrong with the model and the bigger it is the more I have to adjust the book and start over again models have to be two things they have to be useful and they have to be valid there's too many things in life that you don't want to ReDiscover and redo the
(10:30) work so your brain creates these mental shortcuts these mental checklists that you go through in your head a lot of of them are not documented so all the framework really is is documenting the checklist you already go through there's always a process everyone goes through to make a decision as simple as they may be which serial am I going to grab the one that's closest to me you know what I mean like it could be as simple as that there's a framework that you use and it is useful now the question is how valid
(10:51) is it and the validity of a framework depends on how many different circumstances it can be applied to and also still work the very valuable Frameworks like equals mc squared apply in every one that we have found to date which is what makes it so valid when I'm testing a framework I know the situations it does work and so then I start testing it in new situations seeing if it's still valid and if it isn't valid I go back to the original framework and say how would I need to adjust this so it would incorporate both
(11:14) and then I tested another situation and another business situation until eventually I get a framework that I can't find a way that it's wrong the longest process for me is ideating all the pieces that are going to be in the book The Next longest process is actually writing the first draft from there I go through my heavy editing of going from 12th grade language to third grade language with more pictures my goal is is that when someone reads the stuff that I have that they spend as much of their mental capacity on
(11:39) consuming the concepts and not translating the words into things they understand the average American reads somewhere in the neighborhood of fifth to seventh grade depending on where you read which means half of Americans read below that there's a free app called hemingwayapp.com that literally is just a pace box and when you paste your words into the box it highlights it and says this is too complicated adverb passive if you want to train yourself to be a better writer using it gives you immediate feedback because as soon as
(12:08) you change it the color changes and so when you talk about changing people's behavior having something that immediately gives you feedback when you make a change is the best way to reinforce Behavior quickly and so I think it's one of the best teaching writing tools that exists it's so simple you'll be amazed at how much better your writing comes out so if you have a paragraph and you can eliminate a sentence and the paragraph's meaning stays the same eliminate it if you can use shorter sentences versus a long
(12:29) sentence it is better to use the shorter sentence if you have a shorter word it is better to use a try to eliminate adverbs whenever possible really whenever possible like whenever you're like I'm really not sure still trying to eliminate it most times when you see an adverb it's because you did not use the right verb I walked quickly it would be much better to say I ran I always use Simple tenses so rather than like would have liked to I just say wanted or wanted to if you can't make something sound simple it's because you don't get
(12:57) it not them from there I go and send it to four to eight of my like ideal readers people whose opinions I value but don't hold me in high enough esteem that they're not going to tell me the truth so they're like hey I had questions here this didn't make sense or the sound of the contradiction or something else whatever and so they send me back their notes again I use Stephen King because he's just like my hero for writing but he's like if you get lots of different feedback for everyone then you did a good job if everyone's saying the
(13:19) same thing he's like you probably should change it once I get the feedback from those readers I create what would be considered my third and final draft then I send that to an editor for like grammar typos Etc and then at that point I have what I would consider my finished book I spend a thousand hours on a book roughly and a lot of people can't comprehend that like level of work which is also why most people can't make good stuff people think that writing a book is like just literally getting the word count to a book size and then slapping a
(13:44) cover on it and shipping it which is why there are so many bad books there's this visual that Stephen King gives that I think is like the best visual and it gave me hope about writing he said writing is walking uphill with a bag of rocks where you keep adding rocks the higher up the hill you go so the longer you've been writing something the heavier it feels he's like you just have to have the endurance to be able to go through the hard work pruning through the writing and killing The Darlings we're like I spent so much time on the
(14:12) section but it shouldn't be in the book with this particular book I went through eight full drafts so it's about 600 pages of writing to create what is now 200 pages of version 8 of the book so with the leads book I can tell you the sections of the book are understanding how to talk about leads get leads get other people to get you leads get even more leads do it those are the sections of the book right like that's very simple and then within each of those subsections is the different types of ways you can collect leads and so but
(14:38) all of them aligned that single point which is how do I get people more leads if this thing that I'm writing does not apply to that you take it out I'm shooting for a book a year we'll see if I get there but like that's what that's my like mental back of napkin goal is you know I still have to like run all the companies and make these videos and stuff so if you took some takeaways that you can write into your stories into the content that you make into your marketing into your advertising into the stuff you use to sell people's things

(00:00) what's going on everyone what i want to talk to you about today is a question that i get all the time which is how do i know i have a good market right which is what are the things i should be looking for to know i have a market that i should go after and the first thing i want to address here is you know i had this conversation yesterday and someone's like hey i'm between uh you know uh you know dentists and hearing aid specialists and pharmacists right for what market i wanna go after and serve right and i was like okay cool
(00:28) well what are the considerations right and they didn't know how to actually analyze each of those businesses and so the first rule of thumb that i'll give anyone is as long as the market is not dying and is either normal or growing then which of the markets can you provide the most value to all right so most value and that's given your skill set so if you have an advantage inherently or you have experience working with people in a specific marketplace or especially if it's personal experience then i would usually
(00:57) recommend going after that market first because you know their pains you know what it feels like you will empathize with them and you ultimately create a better product that will provide more value to them and you'll be able to win now that's a great scenario but many people i talk to have basically no experience in any market and i'm like okay well then these are the four things that i look for all right so they are as follows the first thing that i'm going to look for is is the market in pain all right so do they have a desperate need
(01:27) for my product or services right a nice to have is not something people are going to take their money out and buy especially in a bad economic condition right if we're in a good economic time when you're watching this and that's awesome and if we're in a bad one then you'll know right so the first thing i'm looking for is do they have a desperate need are they starving for the thing that i'm looking for right there are some things that are timeless right health wealth and relationships are the timeless needs of humanity right uh you
(01:52) know are they are they sad and lonely that's relationships uh are they broke that's always pain and uh health are they are do they feel bad about how they look and are they unhealthy right and so there's the three big ones right but is there key pain that i'm solving the second is is the market growing right so i'll give you an example of this uh i think i've told the the story of my buddy who owned the newspaper company uh he could not figure out why his company was not growing um and he called me up and i was like dude like you're much
(02:25) smarter than i am uh it's probably because you're selling the newspapers he was like no no it can't be that and i was like no i think it's that and as soon as he switched from selling newspapers to selling masks in manufacturing he went from a few million dollars a year to a few million dollars a week all right same entrepreneur simply applied it to a growing marketplace all right the uh the next thing that i'm looking for in terms of marketplace is are they easy to find all right and this is important because if you're marketing
(03:03) and you can't find your prospects if i'm marketing to plastic surgeons for example and the only people seeing my ads are nurses then i'm not going to be able to get my my my product my service in front of them or even get my offer to them if they're impossible to find and so whenever i'm picking a market i'm going to try and find one that i can easily target that has associations they have groups they have channels they all watch they're all congregated in one place and so that way i can cast my fishing line
(03:30) there and then i can hook the clients that can take a step towards me because if you can't find them they'll never find you right and so one they have to be in pain two they have to be growing three they have to be easy to find all right now the fourth one is purchasing power all right which is do they have the monies right now a quick example of this is i had a friend of mine who was looking at this and he was like dude i've got the perfect market i'm going after unemployed people and i want to coach them on how to do their resumes
(03:57) right tons of pain on not having a job he said it's definitely growing because people are coming in and out of the market so there's tons of people that are coming in outside my ads won't get fatigued and i was like okay he's like they're super easy to find and i was like that's great but then he's like no one wants to buy my stuff because they all say they don't they don't have jobs and so he wasn't able to have the purchasing power from this target right and so let me give you an example of of of two different ways that you could use this
(04:24) framework right so let's say if i were a relationship coach i was somebody who serves uh couples i'm good at helping people find love right well i'm gonna look for a market that has all four of these things which means instead of saying i'm gonna help you know college kids right for me my service business find love all right instead of having that's a heart uh college kids find love what i would probably do is instead go after seniors right in maybe their second half of life to find their next partner that would probably be where i would
(05:00) focusing and what happens there is seniors have tons of pain because they're alone it's growing because people die and get older every day right they're easy to find and i know that senior citizens in general have far more money than college kids though right and so even though i have the same core value proposition i'm choosing to serve a better market that i will ultimately probably make more money with all right and so this is kind of the process that i look at is number one above all else which market can i
(05:28) provide the most value to if i have personal experience that's going to trump everything now if i don't have personal experience and i just have a skill of being able to market or sell or whatever then i'm going to look at my market in these in in this four four piece system whatever you want to say checklist and the thing is is you can't just have three of them right uh in the in the newspaper example they were in tons of pain they were easy to find and they had purchasing power the problem is they weren't growing they were shrinking
(05:56) every year right uh the the the unemployment example they were growing they were in pain but they didn't have the purchasing power so that's the that's the problem there uh the nurses and plastic surgeons example that would be one or if i can't find them then i can't display the ads to them and then obviously if people don't watch your product at all and it's just a nice to have then they will not buy it all right and so you want to make sure that you do not have one two three of these you want to have all four in any
(06:23) market you pick and ideally pick a market that you already know you can provide value to and solve a problem that meets these four criteria and you'll have the recipe for success so i hope that made sense that's how i look at markets that's what i look at when i'm trying to invest in companies i look at the founder i see if they already have experience in this and then i see if the problem that we're solving matches these things and then at that point i say you know what i think this is a good opportunity let's do it
(06:47) hope you enjoyed that and uh see you the next video [Music] [Music] [Applause] you

(00:00) want to give you a quick and tactical training this is one of my favorite stories of all time from selling stuff and this comes from the volts of richard schwartz and mano schwartz furriers they're a fourth generation furrier uh in baltimore and they took over the entire market really the larger like maryland pennsylvania market um just simply doing the boring work and being better at the everyday things and so richard schwartz unknowing unbeknownst to him was a a mentor of mine in terms of i just observed a lot
(00:33) of the things that he did in his business and i started doing back of napkin math when i was 17 or 18 and i was like dude this guy kills it um and he was and i probably still is um and uh there was one he's i learned so many things from him um but one of them uh was getting people to say no to say yes all right and so this is a very very real world tactical um tidbit that you can use to close sales now there's a specific type of sale that this really applies to which is a lot of times bolt-on or upsells right and these upsells can be incredibly
(01:11) important to the business in terms of driving bottom line profit liquidating acquisition costs and so usually these are sales that are not complex sales these are not necessarily core offer sales these are sales uh you know within the finish world that might be attributed to supplement sales or meal sales or if you were in retail it'd be like getting someone to buy a scarf with the outfit or um just you know anything along those lines you know getting someone to buy orthotics if you're in the in the physical therapy space or if you're in
(01:38) the dental space getting to buy a special kind of extra brace or special toothpaste or whatever or if you're in the beauty space you know night serums that go with your service package whatever it is right the point is is that usually there's going to be you know one or multiple things you're going to want to go with your core offer all right the reason that this this little trick i learned from him is so powerful um is that it closes like crazy all right so if you're used to having like 20 30 of people take up sales that is a
(02:05) normal amount where people take up sales and the reason he gets 90 plus to take his upsells because they don't know they're being sold all right and so here's the trick and here's how it works and i mean you can take this to the bank like it works okay and i'll give you the example uh that they used uh at mano and so somebody would come in and so every year if you bought a fur coat you would have to store it right and they made they killed it on storage but anyways so people would come in so basically they'd sell someone a car essentially because
(02:35) that's how much a you know fur coat is so they sell some in a car and then uh every year they would maintain that customer relationship by getting them to come back in and store their coat uh during the summer because it's not good to you know keep a really expensive fur in uh you know the heat or whatever right that's at least part of the pitch and so uh everybody brings their fur in to get stored in condition so they brush them you know and i was one of the guys who was brushing them in the freaking warehouse and like spraying these things
(03:01) down uh it was my numbing work but i got to learn a lot while i was there and so anyway uh we brushed these coats and so one of the one of the things one of the promotions you ran as an incentive was get a free pair of fur earmuffs when you store your coat for winter or your cup for summer excuse me and so tons of people would come in because they wanted these true real fur uh earmuffs uh by bringing it in and so what ended up happening is david his son would uh the person would come in and they'd say i want to i would want to
(03:36) do this and can i get the the fur for emotes and so he would show them the free ear muffs and then say well um you're like what we're gonna do is uh store and condition your coat you don't want anything else do you uh and they would say no i don't want anything else but the conditioning was an upsell right and it's almost even the way i presented issues now it's like well you're gonna store in your condition your code but storing code versus storing and doing the brush down and doing the uh the shampooing of the coat
(04:04) is obviously an extra service but it immediately added a couple hundred bucks to every single coat and they were doing thousands of coats right and so anywho uh the point is is that they would get people to just agree that they don't want anything else okay so think about how you can use this strategy right there's there's there's many ways you can use it but the something else is the easiest that i can ever see right so let's say you say hey like this is what you're gonna uh this is what you need to take uh for this weight loss program
(04:34) right these are the four supplements you need to take now you might have more supplements right you're like you don't want to buy anything else do you right and then they're going to automatically a lot of times like you don't want to buy any more stuff do you and then they're like no no i don't i don't want to get anything else right and by doing that you automatically close the sale that you just recommended right and you can do the same thing uh in a different way which would be like um hey uh you don't want to pay full retail
(04:59) for that right and they're going to be like no no i don't it's like cool so you want me to send it uh with this discount to the you know the address i have on file and they'll be like okay yeah let's do that right and so by doing that you're getting them to say uh yes by saying no and the thing is is people are so contrarian people always feel like they're being sold that you actually use that psychological like it's subconscious like they can't even think they're not even making the thought process like they're agreeing
(05:25) because they're so pre-programmed to try not to buy things that they end up buying things and so you use that psychological bias to your advantage it's one of the most powerful techniques i have ever seen in sales most people get 20 to 30 uptake on their upsells if you use an assume close tactic like this you can literally see 90 percent plus take rates on this right and so as a as to wrap up the story when uh they give them the earmuffs at the at the furrier they would they would they would say well now that you have those uh you're gonna need to
(06:00) to store those and condition those as well so that'll be you know an extra whatever and so it ended up happening is that people would get the the free uh the free earmuffs but you'd have to pay to get it stored in conditions which would cover the cost of the firm so uh it was just kind of hilarious because what ended up happening is he'd give it to them they'd have it in their hand and be like well you still need to store it because you just brought your coat here and you're not going to keep these out so to be to be congruent with
(06:23) the story of of needing to store the coats they had to wrap it uh right underneath the jacket and they would take both of them into the back and so people would come in they'd get the ear muffs they'd hold on to them and they put them right back on their coat they say hey you don't want us to do anything else besides you know storing and conditioning do you and they're like no no i don't know anything else like okay cool well let's get that taken care of and then they'd inspect the coat real fast like i want to take care of this
(06:44) button it's kind of loose want us to sew this little seam here and be like yeah sure do anything else to be right no no and so every time each one of these things they just keep selling them but people are so subconsciously uh wired to try and say no to upsells that they would say yes by saying no and so uh you can try and utilize that in your business i think it works very well with kind of like hand-to-hand small upsells um but a lot of these little small upsells can be massive profit drivers in the business
(07:10) this is kind of like your fries and coke situation that i'm talking about here like this is a lot like you don't make your money on the burger you make your money on the fries in the cup because there's the high profit margin things even though it's not the core offer and a lot of times there's huge pockets of profit that most especially most small business owners and especially if you're running like a brick and mortar uh service business uh that you're missing out on so um highly recommend using that strategy if you're like oh man i wish i
(07:35) could use it in my business you can uh just use your brain and be creative because uh winners always think man i wonder how i could use that in my business and losers think that wouldn't work in my business my business is different so decide which one you are and then execute accordingly otherwise lots of love hope you guys have an amazing saturday hope that was a value for you if it is you know drop or tag or like or do all the the fun stuff and uh i hope to see you on the next podcast alright catch you soon bye

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on mosey nation this is alex hormozy your host and uh most legit youtuber with the best setup in existence including my mom's basement i'm kidding this is a 5 million condo and i just happen to not like windows where i work that being said the purpose of this video is to blow up some of the things that i saw online with relation to how to make more money when it comes to getting a raise if you are an employee number one or number two getting a raise from your customers as a business owner because at the end of the day all of us
(00:32) are still beholden to our customers that we serve and so if you don't know who i am my name's alex from mozzie on acquisition.com it's a portfolio of companies that's over 100 million a year and i make these videos because i think it's fun so let's rock and roll so i think the easiest way to solve this dilemma or this problem for not getting paid enough is to understand what are the variables that influence pay right right damn right and so i think a fun process is to go through this and think about it using inversion thinking all
(00:58) right which is something that charlie munger champions and a lot of other great thinkers and so if we wanted to and this would be the problem that we're solving for if we wanted to make as little money as humanly possible and we were employees and or business owners what would we do well number one we would provide very little value all right that'll be the first thing that we do is we'd have we'd have skill set that that just does not provide a significant amount of value to a business and or to a customer all right that's first off is
(01:22) what we would do the second thing that we would do is we would not ask for very much of that of that value that we were creating so hopefully we're creating some level of value which is why we're getting employed or where why we're asked to solve some problem for a customer right we're solving a problem there's a job to be done that is the value that is the potential amount of money that we can earn the amount of that potential money that we earn is did is predicated based on our ability to negotiate and so we ask for a very small
(01:49) amount of that money all right so low value and then of that small number we ask even for a smaller percentage of that number because of our ability to negotiate that would normally be the only two things that you'd think okay well this is my potential and this is how much i ask for and so those are the only two variables that that would create how much i'm getting paid ah but there's a third all right and i'm going to get to the three and how you can flip this at the end of the video all right but the third one that we're going to look at is
(02:15) supply demand dynamics meaning how easily replaceable is the value that we're providing and so in an unideal world in bizarro land where we want to get paid as little as possible using inversion thinking we would one have low value two ask for very little of it and three have a line of people standing behind us the opposite of scarcity right uh working against us we are commoditized our skill is easily found and easily replaced by other willing people who want to do it for less money right because they hate us they hate the
(02:46) economy they hate capitalism and they hate generally moving up in life okay so if you are an employee or you are a business owner and you are trying to get paid more then we can invert this process and think to ourselves what are the ways that we can number one create more value which i wrote a whole book about all right 100 offers 99 cents if you want it number two is how do we negotiate now we have a high potential value that we are creating right so we've now we've flipped the equation we're creating we're creating tremendous amount of
(03:18) value for the person now one of the keys in communicating value is using multiple lenses through it to see it all right so it's not just about and the easiest one is just the quantitative number value in terms of how much money uh are we are we creating right how much money are we helping to produce all right so that is monetary value there are other forms of value right there's lots of services out there that exist that especially consumer services where there is no direct amount of value but there's indirect value so if you help
(03:48) someone lose weight the amount that you can charge on that will depend on who you serve right which would then actually get into a fourth bucket which is picking the right customers right and i'll tell you a quick story about this before i dive back in i think you'll like the tangent so there's a boy and he's 16 years old and he's you know looking to get his first car and his father one day surprises him with the vehicle right so he's super excited he sees the car but it's a little bit of a clunker it's an old you know it's an old
(04:15) car right but he's fine with it and the dad says hey if you want you can go cash this in um and then get you know and then use the money to get something else if you want and he says okay so he says hey why don't you just go down to the you know the the car lot and see uh see what they'll give you for it so he goes over the car a lot you know excited to see what they'll trade trade the car in for and they said you know what uh we'll give you five thousand dollars for the car and he was like okay so he goes back
(04:40) to his dad tells him the story he says okay son well why don't you why don't you try the pawn shop see what see what they'll give you for like the scrap yard so he goes over to the pawn shop scrap yard right it goes there and uh and and he asks the same question he says you know this is the car how much can i get for it they're like ah we'll probably give you a thousand bucks just for like the parts in the metal and he's like so he walks back defeatedly to his dad and he's like you know it's only worth a thousand dollars to those guys
(05:03) his dad says hmm why don't you go down to that antique dealership see what they say so he goes to the antique dealership shows them the car and they say oh my god this is a historic xyz car there's only this many of them ever made this is a 200 000 vehicle the kid blown out of his mind runs back home he's like dad you won't believe it and the dad smiles and he's like what he's like they say this car is unbelievably valuable it's historic it's like one of a kind blah blah blah and so the dad pauses and says so listen
(05:31) son what i want you to see from this is that the value that someone will give you is not necessarily just a result of the vehicle of who you are but who you are talking to and so a hidden bonus of this video that i'm going to give you right now is that there are three is what i said but the fourth one is who we are serving right so the amount that you can charge if you are a business owner will be also predicated on who you serve right if you can help a billionaire lose weight he will probably pay you more than somebody who's on
(06:00) who's on unemployment right just the nature of like that problem to that person is more valuable to solve right and that's because indirectly for them if that helps the billionaire right get his wife which he might value more right or he might be able to seal a deal because people respect him or whatever it is right then there is more indirect value that you can ascribe to the the services that are being provided okay so i said there were three but there's actually four because i'm trying to keep you interested in the video right keep
(06:28) keep going keep it keep you guessing all right but so i said number one was value okay so values can be predicated on who we're serving and also how much value we can provide which is going to come into what's the dream outcome we're providing them how likely do they think that they're going to get that with you as an employee and or as a business they're hiring because all of us are doing jobs all of us are employees right in one way or another how quickly we can get that done and then how much work they have to do
(06:52) as a result of that which you can translate in a couple ways if you're an employee and someone always has to check up on you and always has to give you direct instructions that is less valuable of employee than somebody an employee who's coming with the ideas can get things done quickly i have a large amount of confidence that someone's going to do the job and the perceived outcome that i that i want to create that employee can duplicate quickly awesome so that's you can reverse the value equation that i talk about in the
(07:13) book whether you're working for a customer or you're working for a boss either of those things and i'll get to how you can make more money as an employee in a second okay so one we're flipping the inversion to we create lots of value number two is going to be how much we ask for all right so how much we negotiate and so as a business we do this by setting our prices right that is that is fundamentally the negotiation that occurs so we set our prices and a lot of times you'd be amazed that just asking for more you get more right
(07:40) because most people sell from their own wallet as in they think this is a lot of money and therefore they ask for what they believe is a lot of money and here's the fundamental fallacy with this problem what comes easy to you is typically not easy for other people and so i'll give you a simple example personally i am not a car guy i am not a fix-it guy i i just don't care and so if i went to a mechanic shop and they said hey we've gotta you know change your oil and actually you know do xyz in your car it's gonna be you know 100 bucks if they
(08:08) say 100 bucks or 300 bucks it's it really isn't gonna like i'm not gonna notice i'm not gonna care but if you talk to another mechanic they're like you charge that guy 200 to change his oil that's crazy it only takes two seconds and all you have to do is turn the knob and the oil comes out and then pour it back in whatever right and it's because to them to a mechanic changing oil seems like a very easy thing to do and it probably is but to me it's something that is going to take me time to learn that i don't care and so what
(08:33) is easy to one person because you have been doing it for so long might not necessarily be easy to other people and so your perception of the value is actually skewed which is why you should not be the one necessarily setting your prices you allow the market to set the prices for your services and or the pay that you get so number one we provide lots of value number two you negotiate or ask for a higher amount okay and if you're an employee an easy way to do that is create some sort of variable compensation for yourself and say hey
(09:00) these are ways that i think i can tie into the revenue of the business would it be fair would it be unreasonable for me to ask for a percentage of that not for the necessarily the whole company but at least in this way so that i can drive towards those goals which will also make the company more money which is exactly what we're doing as a you know when we serve uh customers right especially if you're in b2b services you say listen i think that this thing will yield this amount of results and i would like a percentage of that right and it's
(09:24) variable compensation so the best way and the highest people who make the most money have variable compensation business owners have variable compensation depends on how well your business does and how how much you serve your customers the business itself is variable compensation right the enterprise value all right so if you can shift your thinking around this it will pay dividends so value negotiations go and the third one which is competitive landscape competitive dynamics or supply demand for the job to be done all right
(09:47) so think about this way if i have lots of people who can do the job if i have somebody who comes up to me let's say they're an employee and they say hey i'm providing lots of value and i would like to ask for more i would not have leverage on this situation if there was 20 other people who were lined up who could do the job and were willing to accept less which is why this applies for both labor as it does for owning a business it's both sides right if i want to provide xyz service and there's another guy who's willing to provide xyz
(10:14) service for less and there's nothing that really differentiates us then most consumers will just go to the one that costs less which brings up the important lesson of how do you invert this how do we solve this problem which is we have to be in a category of one all right and so we do this by trying to niche down and create more specialized services because then we decreased the pool of people that we were competing against now as you scale up in a business i'm going to answer this as a business and also for employees as you scale up in a
(10:40) business you do in general go broader but usually you can use the experience the depth of knowledge you have and then be able to be better at that stuff at a larger scale and so the easiest thing to do which is why i talk about this in the book is is is niche down at first right so that we can get really really good at delivering one very specific high amount of value to a very specific customer right and so when we do that we basically fall into creating lots of value we price high so we're asking for a bigger percentage of the value that we
(11:08) know we're creating and we're doing it as a category of one in that there's no other people who can do it and so we add other features and bells and whistles and bonuses and guarantees to create offers that are more compelling to a customer that are one of a kind which make it more difficult for other people to compete against us and thereby allow us to capture a larger percentage of the value that we are creating that's the idea that's the point now if you're an employee and you walk through this process then the idea is how can i use
(11:35) my unique unique being the key skills and experiences to make the business that i'm working for more money right because ultimately that is i mean that's where you're getting compensated it's a percentage of the revenue that you're responsible for right indirectly or directly and the more directly you can be associated with it the more you will get compensated because the more clearly you can point to the value that you are creating right because the more direct it is the less argumentation or discount that will be
(12:00) applied to the value that you're creating for the business right does that make sense hopefully it makes sense okay so if we are an employee and we want to make more money then we're going to use our unique skills and experiences and we're going to try and quantify to the highest degree possible how we can directly impact the bottom line of the business we're going to ask for variable compensation around the value that we are providing for the business which just works the same if you're if you're a business and we're going to be able to
(12:27) get it and this is the the third piece here the reason that we're going to be able to get it is because no one else can do it all right and that's the idea and so this also kind of brings in that part that the bonus number four which is the type of opportunity that you are pursuing in terms of the overarching umbrella of business that you were working for will also dictate how much you get paid right like if you work at a dry cleaning business it will be very difficult for you to make a million dollars a year and that's because the
(12:52) business doesn't make a million dollars a year in all likelihood right and so your opportunity vehicle will always be a subset of the business opportunity that you're working underneath of and i think this is a good thing to to hit on because uh what it takes which is a great book by stuart uh stuart schwartzman stephen schwartzman start the guy started blackstone okay anyways that guy all right he's worth 37 billion dollars today so he's pretty rich he's pretty good and what he talks about is the idea and i think many other
(13:20) visionaries have said this but you need to have a vision that is big enough for your business that others people's visions fit inside of it and so what that really means is that you need to have a pie that's big enough that everyone can get wealthy and if you're operating in an opportunity vehicle that does not allow other people to get wealthy then you will probably not attract 10 out of 10 talent and if you are 10 out of 10 talent then maybe you should be looking for bigger visions bigger visionaries bigger companies who
(13:43) have bigger goals and bigger dreams so that you can learn unique expertise while working at those businesses because listening to uncle warren there's only two things you should be working for whether you're learning or you're earning right so you should get paid you should get paid in one or two or ideally both ways when you work which you should be learning all the time and you should be earning right and it should definitely at least be one of those two things and if you're not learning and you're not earning you
(14:05) should stop working wherever you're working all right which is why we're seeing a precipitous drop in i would say frontline retail very generic workers last uh two months i think we have eight million people quit their jobs in those kind of frontline sectors because the opportunity was not big enough right and so for us we can think about this as business owners when we're thinking about our employees we can think we have as business owners as we're communicating value to our customers which is how can i create the value how
(14:29) can i how can i capture the value through my pricing and my ability to negotiate and then how can i create a category once i'm not competing it's everyone else's shitty prices and so as the employee we do the exact same thing except our prices are the wages that we charge and so in that way being a business business owner or an employee actually is very similar it's just that we are just one degree separated from the customer right so the business owner is closer to the customer than the employee that works for the business
(14:55) from a value creation standpoint business serves the customer employee search the business right and they do that i say that as a from a big picture perspective even though the employee may directly be uh servicing the customer they do it within the overarching infrastructure of the business that exists all right and so right now if you want to make more money you want to get paid more whether you are a business owner or an employee think about how you measure up in each of those three dynamics and if you're like how do i
(15:20) create more value i wrote a book about it it's 99 cents you can grab it if you want it's on amazon it's 4 000 five-star reviews i think people like it at least or at least they just like leaving five-star reviews for it so either way i'm cool with it um ideally they like it though but that's about the the value creation your ability to negotiate honestly like you could have all the tips in the world but i'll tell you the simple simplest law of negotiation is this he who has the most options wins the circumstance
(15:42) and so your ability to get other customers your ability to have other jobs if you're an employee those that you that you bring to the table prior to your negotiation will give you all the leverage you need if you have a hundred girls who are lined up to date you or a hundred guys who are lined up to date you you have more leverage in the quote negotiation if you have if hundreds of other businesses who want you you have far more ability to negotiate which is why people are like how does the ceo make 50 million bonus or whatever from
(16:08) his publicly traded companies like well do you know the amount of guys who can do that specific job you can count on one hand in the entire planet right and so that is why because the supply demand dynamics for that specific role right and the value that's being created and the percentage that they negotiate that's how that kind of money gets created you can make obscene amounts of money as both a business owner and or an employee as long as you understand those three dynamics all right and as again the added bonded caveat to that is that
(16:33) those guys can make that kind of money because they're operating within a business that has a massive dream that is really to impact humanity overall and lots of people can get wealthy in that both the owners and the employees because in a lot of ways the compensation structures the bonuses options things like that they structure are based on variable compensation on the overall production of the business all right so um lots of love everyone if you're new to mozination welcome and i will see you guys in the next video

Transcript:
(00:00) i'm going to share with you my plan to get to a billion dollars a year in revenue and i'm going to answer the number one question that i get most frequently which is why we don't sell courses and why i give our stuff away for free without further ado let's rock and roll so my name is alex mosey for those who are new to the channel i own acquisition.
(00:18) com it's a portfolio of companies that does about 85 million a year in revenue and uh the reason for that is because those companies pay for all the stuff that i have already and i don't think selling a thousand dollar course is really going to be that meaningful to me so that being said the exciting news um is why we are doing this and what you have to gain from it in growing acquisition.
(00:36) com the portfolio companies we've acquired a lot of skills along the way so how to create offers how to generate leads how to monetize your acquisition so you can get customers for free how to sell how to scale sales teams how to increase lifetime gross profit per customer how to price adequately like the beliefs around it how to exit the business all of these different things at this point we've already sold seven businesses in my career we have six i think right now in our portfolio companies we continue to uh want to acquire more and so my entire thesis
(01:03) behind acquisition.com and stay tuned because you're gonna like the thing that i'm giving you at the end it's gonna be sick and it's gonna be worth more than a lot of stuff on the internet the reason that i do acquisition.com the thesis behind it is that i believe the education system is broken and many of you probably agree with me right who wants to pay fifty thousand hundred thousand two hundred thousand dollars a year right for an education that adds zero value if you can get the same job at the same pay before you go in as you can get
(01:25) after you go to college then what's the point right and not only that because it's government subsidized they don't let you get out of the debt which is insane to me in what world would you give an 18 year old 200 000 they can never get out of right it's like making an irreversible decision and and they do that because they saddle you with debt and they take 35 of your paycheck for the rest of your life and you don't know that but they're doing it through interest all right anyways that being said enter acquisition.com the reason i
(01:52) believe that this explosion of the guru space has happened over the last 10 15 years is because the demand for high value skills has not changed people want to work by and large people want to provide value people want to be good at something and exchange their time and effort and knowledge for money right but the thing is is they're not getting the skills and so they continue to seek and the demand is there it is just unsatisfied and so because of technology right because of the changes in the world technology and i'll quote neval
(02:21) ravage i like this quote a lot technology democratizes consumption and consolidates production and what that means is if you're the best in the world you get to do it for everyone and so my thesis around acquisitions.com is that education will become increasingly fragmented meaning rather than one big glop of general education people are going to get more and more niched down in the types of education that they learn they'll learn how to become hairdressers they'll learn how to become plumbers they'll learn how to run gyms
(02:48) they'll learn how to be online trainers learn how to be life coaches to learn how to do whatever you know fix atm machines whatever it is there are skills that are niche and more high value that they can exchange the marketplace for money and they can feed themselves and so my goal with acquisition.
(03:02) com is to give the thing that i have that is more valuable than money for those of you who do follow our channel my wife and i donate about a million dollars a year right now of personal income and we've already signed away our wills that we will be donating the vast majority of our of our dollars to charities upon our death the thing is is that as much as i i can give money the thing that i can give at far more leverage and a far more scale is the skills that we have acquired in order to create that money and i can do that at
(03:25) zero cost and so that is the thesis behind this is that i want to take all the skills that i have and transfer them to everyone else and the idea here is that i can help as many people get to 1 million 3 million 5 million a year and then maybe someday if it's awesome if you're at 5 or 10 or 15 or 20 and you'd like to get to 50 million you'd like to get 100 million you'll allow us to to help and and invest in your business so we can do it together otherwise everything we have is free um and today mark's a very
(03:54) important announcement that i have for everyone on the channel mozi nation love you all and it's for you guys the first of 10 different courses at least at this point i have 10 that are outlined that i will be releasing with books and audio books and downloads to go with it so the first is uh 100 million offers this is a book you can get it on amazon for 99 cents go grab it if you want the hard copy i think it says i think this is like 20 bucks uh but it's full colorful print and that i make i think a dollar
(04:19) on this all right and i donated all the stuff to charity anyways so you can get that and then on the site um you can get the downloads and all that stuff you don't have to opt in anything you can just click and download it has all the checklists all the saps everything that we do to actually do this within our businesses all right you can just have them and then we will be releasing all of the videos that you can find on the site you'll also find them here on youtube as one playlist alright so you can watch them uninterrupted no purchase
(04:44) necessary nothing and this is why i do this for free is because candidly i have gotten to a point where money only solves money problems and i have solved all of my money problems and what remain are problems that money can't solve and so uh in an attempt to solve the problems that money can't solve which for me our meaning meaning in life if i know that i'm going to be giving away everything that i have when i die it sounds silly to not enjoy that giving process while i'm alive and to give the thing that is more valuable
(05:17) the most valuable thing that i have which are the skills and the beliefs that i've acquired that have gotten us here which i believe that anyone can acquire those skills those traits and beliefs if they want to and so i want to make that available to everyone and anyone who has that desire and so that is uh the reason that i wrote the book that is the reason that we have the courses and that is the reason that i will continue to do this because i really like it and so um i love you all i am your number one fan i am rooting
(05:49) for you more than you can imagine and because i know that when i die eventually on a long enough time horizon all of the money and wealth that our companies will amass will eventually get scattered to the wind and the legacy that i will leave will eventually be forgotten and so i might as well enjoy the ride with you all that stuff will now be live i will keep you guys posted as we as we release new courses and books uh please don't ask when they're coming out the the litmus test for when i will release it is when it is good
(06:15) enough to be better than the thing that you just had and so i always want to make it better and better and better and the difference between good and great is vast and the difference between vast sorry the difference between great and exceptional or remarkable is even wider and it takes time to have several coats of paint on work and let it sit and let it marinate and let it simplify and distill so that i can try and transfer the knowledge as quickly and as seamlessly from me to you as possible in a way that is not boring as hell and so
(06:44) that is my goal all right and so uh at this point uh the courses that will be coming out are first uh the one that is now live is the 100 million dollar offers course how to make offers so good people feel stupid saying no so right now if you struggle to sell you struggle to get leads things like that it's because usually your offer is poor right so if you're not good at sales a lot of times the thing that you're actually selling people don't want and there's ways to structure the offer so way more people will buy it all right this is one
(07:08) of the cornerstone pillars and i had some of the other courses already outlined and written but i realized i had to do this first all right so i'm teaching these courses in sequence for how you would do it to improve and build your business the second course and book will be around lead generation so once you have the offer the thing that you're going to sell that people want it's how do i get more leads all right so i'll show you the ways that we get leads in all the companies across all different channels and the process that we follow
(07:30) to do that the next one after that will be called money models alright so it's how you can grow without outside capital alright so we've been able to grow each of these businesses that we have without any outside capital because we use a process called client finance acquisition which basically means that we use the money from the marketplace to fund our own growth so we have a negative acquisition cost it means it costs us less money to get a customer than than we make in a getting it all right and we can collect more than that
(07:54) in 30 days of cash so we can continue to reinvest in acquisition so the acquisition is no longer a bottleneck which leaves us naturally the next thing which is sales so i'll show you how to script the sales process choreograph the process and the words and all that kind of stuff that'll be the next book all right the book after that be scaling sales teams all right because that's a whole nother skill um is scaling the actual team and recruiting and compensation and management and training all that stuff and that's what really
(08:16) builds big enterprises after that we'll go into uh pricing and increasing lifetime gross profit per customer so how do you actually do that in a way that is operationally efficient all right and so we've done this in a lot of companies that's one of the things that we do very well because the back end ultimately informs the front and the more money you make per customer the more that you can ultimately uh spend on acquisition and then scale the company uh as a result of that and at the end of the day the product is always
(08:37) going to be the number one thing that ultimately would determine the success of the company people think it's about the marketing if you wanna if you wanna make a little bit of money sure learn how to promote learn how to market like i mean anyone can sell anything to somebody once right but the guys who build fortunes learn how that once they make a sale they make a sale to get a customer they don't get customers to make sales think about that for a second you make a sale to create the relationship of a customer that then
(09:01) buys again and again and again and again built on the trust and the value that you provided in excess of the price that they paid right people pay right for the discrepancy between what they pay and what they get right that is the value that is the customer surplus that is where they feel like they got a good deal and so a good deal has nothing to do with the price but everything to do with the value and so my goal here with everything that i have is that i'm pricing this at zero so that hopefully you get the most value
(09:29) humanly possible and so anyways moseynation i do this stuff for you guys um i do this because candidly i enjoy it i had an executive coach a while back when i was kind of feeling like i didn't have any meaning there was just lots of money that was plowing in every week and i was like i don't know what i want to do and she was like what do you enjoy doing and i was like well i enjoy reading i enjoy writing uh and i enjoy transferring the skills that i have to other people and i like drawing the frameworks out so that
(09:53) i learn in teaching and she was like well how can you design uh you know a life around that and so i went to work and that was about a year and a half ago um was where kind of the idea for acquisition.com started um and i was like i wanna help entrepreneurs in general and i wanna do it in a way that no one else is doing it so that is um that's why i'm doing this and so uh yeah my goal is that if you're if you're if you're new entrepreneur and you're you know trying to make your first dollar first million or fifth million whatever
(10:22) it is um that we can help you along the way and long term if you ever want us to invest in your business if you cross the 5 million ish threshold you're 5 or 10 or 15 and you like to get to 30 or 50 or 100 um then you'll allow us that that fun opportunity with you but otherwise uh everything we have is free uh mosey nation keep being awesome and i'll see you guys in the videos

The first 5 hires EVERY entrepreneur should make...or go broke... - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7NqsFh5ej0w

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video i'm going to walk you through the first five hires that you need to bring on in your company as you are growing and as a fundamental framework to think through this you want to think about especially for the first five that they are really just helping you do more and so think of them as extensions of yourself over time we're going to transition from that philosophy to really building a team in departments but each of the five will more or less correspond to being an extension of you and doing the repeated tasks that are
(00:25) time consuming but do not necessarily add as much value as some of the more strategic pieces of each of the roles all right and so if you don't know i am my name is akshmosie on acquisition.com this portfolio company is about 85 million a year i make these videos because a lot of people broke and i do not want you to be one of them so let's rock and roll so the first of these things in terms of the order and sequence that you're going to be hiring them in is going to be in the reverse order of the value that's being
(00:46) delivered and or what you can get in the marketplace in terms of dollars per hour and so the more valuable the skill the more it will cost and so you want to replace the skills that cost the least amount of money for you right should make sense and so typically one of the first two hires and this can happen in any order is going to be one person who's going to be more of an administrative help to you because as you start a business especially in the beginning there's lots of administrative work that needs to be done it must be
(01:08) done but it's not necessarily the high value work that's going to move the business forward but it must be done and so number one will typically be someone in that type of role the second hire will typically be somebody in the customer success or customer support role all right and you're still likely going to be heavily involved in the success or delivery of the product or service that you have but this person is going to help take away some of the repeated tasks that you are doing that are not necessarily value additive but
(01:31) must be done alright so this is like handling returns talking to customers about repeated tasks uh you know switching out billing stuff and again you'll see that there's some crossover between this administrative role and the help with delivery because in the beginning that's where a lot of your time is going to start occurring note that you're still probably marketing you're still probably selling because that's what you need to do at this point in the game the third piece will likely be the first sales person all right and
(01:54) that's because and again this will depend based on how good you are at sales right so like if sales is not necessarily your strong suit then you might take this earlier if it is a strong suit of yours you're gonna take it a little bit later because your dollars per hour in that role continues to grow and so i don't want you to take these as hard and fast rules these are just general rules of thumb that the corresponding framework that you need to be thinking this through is how much value am i making per dollar and then
(02:16) how much would it cost me to replace that dollar per hour so it's like if i do not generate a lot of dollars power and it doesn't cost a lot of money then that will be the first thing now if i'm generating a lot of money and i can replace it for a medium amount of money then it's like well i'm it's the net difference right and that's what we're looking at in terms of how we're replacing each of these roles and so right off the bat you're gonna have some sort of administrative help then you're gonna have some sort of customer
(02:37) support help then you're gonna probably hire some sort of sales role from there now kind of depends a little bit on the role you'll probably have someone who starts assisting you with the promotion or marketing of your business so this is oftentimes somebody who's doing setting or doing prospecting for you or if you uh generate customers based off content this is probably somebody who's being a videographer of some sort or helping you create the content in some way some of the more laborious parts that are not as
(03:01) value additive that would be kind of that fourth looking higher and again that can flip with the sales role so like if for example you're a killer salesman then you might have somebody who's prospecting and doing some of the intro calls for you so that the majority of your time is spent just closing which is the higher value task so hopefully this common theme is working out and making sense to you because it's like the number one question i get or one of among the top questions i get is like what order should i hire people in when
(03:21) i'm starting my business the next one is and again all of these roles can be some of these things can be fractional right in the beginning so you'll probably have some sort of fractional bookkeeper which is really filling the gap for the finance hole so they're just doing basic level of accounting for you to get so you just know how much money you're making at that time they can help you take control of your expenses etc over time that rule will probably come in house but much a little bit later so like before you're at 100 000 a month
(03:43) you probably don't have a ton uh that's going on so just having a fractured bookkeeper is sufficient same thing with you know somebody who's helping you with your taxes somebody who's helping you with legal stuff like you'll have a lawyer but it's not going to be in-house and so as you're moving up this value ladder in terms of the the value per hour and the cost per hour that you can get this the process of entrepreneurship if you think from a big picture perspective it's always just buying back your time so that you can level up the
(04:07) amount of time you're spending on high leverage activities now here's a key point i see this happen all the time i'll see entrepreneurs replace all of their time and then they don't do anything with that added time to add more value and so in that case your profit margins will go down because you are not continuing to add and do the things that generate the income now as you progress each of these roles become more solidified and these people ideally in a perfect world actually can ascend up and then have teams underneath of
(04:32) them the person who's helping you originally now has a team of people helping them the administrative person originally you might have to send them into a director of operations who's really pushing each of the tasks and projects forward they end up being a mini project manager for you if done properly right the sales person might become a sales director or sales manager who's actually leading and training a series of of sales people now i will tell you that a lot of times people have the difficulty of going from an
(04:54) individual contributor at a high level to a manager it's one of the hardest transitions in business and it's commonly messed up by most people all right and so one of the things that comes with experience in entrepreneurship is you recognize the people who have the talent to do the thing that is required later so you can hire those people earlier on now you can't take you know a cool a billion dollar company and put them in as your operator one because they probably could probably afford it too they're probably
(05:15) not that interested in the opportunity yet unless you have funding or some sort of a vehicle that you can acquire that talent earlier and so as a final concept that i want to introduce to you is that whenever you are starting a business you are incurring debt and this is something that i'm now very very convinced of and so you're incurring lots of types of debt you are incurring life debt you are incurring management debt you are incurring financial debt you're encouraging technological debt right so that a technological debt which by the
(05:40) way is probably if you had another next full-time hire it's usually a tech person who's helping you manage the crm build out sites and kind of make all the things that you want to have happen or know should be happening in the background actually happen in the real world they're helping manage passwords onboard new new people in terms of getting them logins all that kind of jazz and so in terms of the debt that you're incurring if you don't have a good crm that's in place you will incur that debt and then you'll have to pay it
(06:01) back with interest later when the company's bigger if you don't have a good bookkeeper in place you'll have your finances will be a mess and as you scale you'll have to fix and pay back that debt later if you have not the best people or the values are not there then you're encouraging management debt which means you'll have cultural debt which means you'll have to pay that back later and so the idea in terms of moving quickly in the game of entrepreneurship is recognizing which debt i want to incur in what order and so i used to poo
(06:24) poo the idea of investors and venture capital and things like that who gave people money to start because i was like that's not real entrepreneurship and i think as i've you know weathered or aged in the game i don't see it that way anymore i just see it as just fundamentally an advantage is that they're choosing financial debt to incur fewer other debts incur fewer operational debt incur less talent debt management debt crm debt like you might have to have a bigger crm that's better for you so that you can scale with
(06:48) having to switch platforms which is common but it would cost more money up front so if you're bootstrapped you might not be willing or able to do that but if you have funding or you have money that you're willing to invest in the business upfront then sometimes you can do that and so one of the things that is difficult with people who grow bigger companies faster is that they skip through the earlier stages because they know how to do it and so it's the reason that each of the companies that we've had subsequently have grown bigger
(07:09) faster stronger than the companies that preceded them because we are willing to incur less of the other types of debt rather than financial debt because we have the finances and so we can skip steps in the growth process that would normally off-rail a quarter's worth of growth by implementing a new crm or offload a quarter or set me back another quarter because i have to fix my financials or set me back another year because i have a whole bunch of management team in place where inexperienced and i need to get more
(07:32) been there done that's on the team and fewer i'll learn as i go and so as we're thinking through this and you're hiring your team the two major frameworks that i'd like you to take away with this is number one you're hiring in reverse order a value that you are providing and cost to the marketplace that you can use to replace it and so typically you will one gets customer support two some sort of administrative role three some sort of sales or setter role four some sort of marketing assist five some sort of
(07:56) fractional bookkeeper and or a sixth which would be your it person or tech person that is usually the beginning of the core team and then a christmas tree is down so each of them right now have five people hanging off of them let me see as this doesn't freeze there we go you'll have five people hanging off of each of these not necessarily 5it people but hopefully you can understand it especially on the marketing the sales and on the delivery those are the teams that tend to grow as the companies grow and the you know it and and finance
(08:21) departments and hr departments which end up getting built over time there's a ratio that is a higher ratio as in you need fewer of them per amount of customers or employees that you have in the company and so as you scale that is framework number one and then framework number two is be mindful of the type of debt that you are incurring and make sure it is the type of debt that you would prefer to incur if you have the choice and so if you are new to the channel welcome to mozy nation and enjoy the next video bye

Transcript:
(00:00) i remember i was driving back home and i got this text and it said hey we closed two sales today and there had been four people who had walked into the business and i had to pull over to the side of the road because i was i got so emotional i got teary because it was the first time that someone else had ever sold something besides me and so that was the first moment when i realized that like this could become a business that did not require me and if you don't know who i am my name is alex ramose i own acquisition.com it's a portfolio of
(00:28) companies that now does about 85 million a year and the reason for this video is i want to walk you through one of the most important steps which is how do you hire excellent sales people and how do you recognize great sales people and so now i've built i can't tell you the amount of team like sales teams that we've now now built up but i can tell you this video is going to be specifically about recognizing talent and so um a couple quick frameworks that i want to go through number one when i started in this business i took every single sale
(00:56) and it was because i was so afraid that somebody would waste the opportunity so if you have that fear i understand where you're coming from second when i had my first sale that was not me i i just had this emotional breakdown so i was like oh my god this could actually happen and i promise you if you haven't had it happen yet you will when it does because you realize that this business can actually work without you and other people can make it rain too right and then i'll tell you a quick story that illustrate the next point that would
(01:19) make so as i you know hired some sales people now that first sales person were they exception don't know but they were able to get the job done later on i had my first kind of like killer and his name was mauro negreti and he uh he came in i don't know a year or two into the business a year into the business and he so quickly was able to assume the sales role and to show you how laughable this is he started and i was about to start training him and some lady walked in the door and i was like hey man like i can take
(01:54) it he's like no i'm good he's like go do your thing he's like fitness nutrition accountability okay i'll figure it out and he ended up closing this first lady who walked in the door for a paid and full and i remember walking in like completely dumbstruck i was like he didn't even know what the pitch was but she walked out giggling happy so excited to start and what that moment taught me was that it is good to train sales people but it's better to take great sales people and then just point them in a direction and so this
(02:24) has informed a lot of the thinking that i have around talent in general and i'll tell you a couple of frameworks that have informed this but like if you look at harvard harvard doesn't produce the smartest people they select the smartest people and then they put smart uh professors in front of them but like the base level of intelligence of everyone who's at harvard is already exceptionally high and so like even if the teachers at harvard were not exceptional the students are and they would be successful independent of that
(02:51) because their selection is so ridiculous right and so if we can think about our own companies that way and especially if you're in the service business like look at the biggest service companies out there like look at mckinsey look at bain look at bcg look at basically a lot of the finance world is our service-based businesses a lot of times right and they're able to do that because they create such a pool to select from that they are able to skim for the best talent right i heard this uh quote from uh estrella kathy who's the founder of
(03:19) chick-fil-a you win the championship in the draft and so it was such a belief that they had about picking the right people even more so than training and i would say that i have moved in that direction of a little bit more nature than nurture when it comes to roles specifically sales especially there are certain characteristics about building rapport about having certain you know dynamics or energy whatever you want to say that like mario negrete when he walked in he had all of these things and he didn't even know the pitch but he
(03:49) won that sale off of just pure rapport and so if i'm going to allocate the same level of time to training somebody i might as well start with somebody who has a much higher base because i could spend 10 hours to take someone from a two to a four and a half or i could spend the same 10 hours taking someone from a six to a nine and the thing is i'm also going to get more bang for my buck in terms of my hours of training with somebody who has a natural proclivity for selling compared to somebody who does not what's interesting
(04:19) about this and this is just like my observation is that you just have to be willing to talk to more people in the uh recruiting process i will say like from a recruiting standpoint there's there's two kind of things to look out for if you're if you're if you cannot pay super handsomely based on your price points which you need to maybe fix later but like if you can't pay super well for the sales person then you need to look harder and you'll need to interview more people and you'll need to probably run ads and use your network if you can pay
(04:45) well the best sales people are already employed and so it comes down to recruiting those sales people from other sales jobs ideally from companies just like yours so that they already know a lot of the things coming into it so it decreases the ramp up time for them because all we're really doing is swapping products and the actual sales cycle the type of sale is it a transactional sales a long sale is it a software sale is it a coaching program set whatever it is right there's so few variables that were changing that they
(05:11) can immediately jump and go which also allows you to make a judgment on their proficiency faster and so as a quick side note to this because this is something that i've given a lot of thought if you look at the top sales people and sales trainers and this is going to drive point drive home the point that i was making earlier about it being much of it being born all right is that if you look at the top people who are in the space you look at jordan belfort right you look at bradley you look at um and some people would would say me in
(05:39) term from a selling perspective all the guys that i know who have taught sales were exceptional salespeople day one bradley started selling cars when he was 18 years old was the top salesman at 18 years old when he started and he was like i just found something i was really good at jordan belford talks about how he didn't know how to train anybody in his book and then all of a sudden he for the first time ever wrote out a framework to explain the straight line sale system which became his book and all that kind of stuff but he up to that
(06:06) point it was just what he naturally did right and i can tell you in my instance as well i'd already closed thousands of deals before i even consumed my first sales training and so like i do think that if we are selecting sales people i think it's much more about selection than it's about training the training is to remind them how good they are not necessarily to make them good all right and this is something that has shifted over time for me specifically now if you're like well i suck at sales you can absolutely put way
(06:32) more time into yourself than a business would reasonably put into an employee all right like you have you all the time so you can train you in all your off hours and you're spending your own time to invest in yourself but from a return on investment perspective it's the cost of finding a good sales person compared to the cost of training a bad or mediocre salesperson is significantly lower it's much easier to find the right people than it is to take somebody and then make such a crazy extensive training unless your entire model is we
(06:59) just take on every single person who walks in the door like 24-hour fitness has this model they take on anybody who has a pulse and then they put them through a ridiculous culling process and then 10 of people make it in the first 90 days and may the arms be ever in your favor right that's their process and then those people know how to sell and so they just make ridiculous requirements that almost no one can meet except for exceptional sales people and they they let that they have obviously training systems and whatnot but for the
(07:25) most part it's teaching them about their process and just having old sales people explain to new sales people some of the tips and tricks that have just like made them better rather than teaching the fundamentals of selling and so back to you if you're somebody who's not good at sales that's okay you get there through practice and repetition but in terms of like you have to get good at it because it is like it is core to running a business especially a small business is learning how to close right and so if you take
(07:51) time to learn it it's okay it's a skill that you're going to add in your arsenal and then it'll allow you to recognize good sales people in the future but you can't spend a year trying to train somebody who's not good you can spend a year trying to train you right and that's the difference when we're selecting for exceptional sales people which is what i'm saying selecting for exceptional sales people if you pay less you have to talk to more people to find them and then you have to have low tolerance in terms of how quickly they
(08:17) make a sale and i would say for us if somebody doesn't close a deal in the first sales cycle meaning like depending on the the length of the transaction uh like some people you know there's all transactional sales some people might be a two-week sales cycler or a one-month sales cycle depending what you're selling if someone has done a full sale cycle and they haven't closed the deal i already know that they're not a killer because every single killer i've ever had closes deals in their first cycle just like mario getty like i said
(08:40) earlier the killers come in and start killing and then they just get better at killing with the tweaks in the trainings that we have the guys who don't do that are the ones that are like no give me another shot i like i just got to learn like you know blah blah blah and the thing is it's like it just drags on an inevitable consequence and so right now if you have somebody on your team and you've been in that dragging it on and they're like just barely good enough to stay on the team and every single quarter you're like are we gonna let go
(09:03) of this guy i don't know he's not like a winner but like i guess we kind of need him to keep putting some numbers up if you get rid of the people who are dragging the team down the culture of the team will improve and i promise you whenever you cut the bottom the top moves up right and then it also will set the new bar for the person who comes in it's like this is how a world-class team operates are you up for this and the thing is is the tighter and the higher that team is the faster they'll point the person out if they don't fit or
(09:30) they'll immediately accept and glob in the person they'll become part of the unit so if you're looking for sales people and you're looking to scale the sales team the best sales people are born in my opinion not made we can select for those people either through recruiting them directly from people who have very similar businesses to us or we have to interview many more people and the feeling you get in that tingle when you're like oh god i really have to have this guy that's when you hire not when you're like i mean i guess this guy
(09:56) could do the job can't do that it's not gonna work and then on the flip side once that person is in if they haven't closed the deal on that first cycle the longer i've been doing business the shorter my tolerance for somebody not being exceptional is because every person that has been exceptional i know immediately and so i just have less and less time where i think maybe they'll turn it around maybe some more training we'll get them there when it's when a lot of times you win the draft on the pick and so thank you guys appreciate it
(10:20) if you're new to mozy nation welcome and i'll see you guys in the next video bye

(00:00) if you want to build a business that you can eventually sell this video is for you I've built and sold nine companies the last one I sold was 46.2 million and so I'm just drawing on my experience from selling those to different partners competitors private Equity strategic buyers so that I can tell you the things that I've learned so that you can get there much faster than it took me there was a guy who had uh rental events so basically he started an event business where he would he'd basically have a venue that he would rent and uh you know
(00:27) he'd have two three events a week there and he would charge whatever the you know the the day rate is for the event and that would be more than what his rent was and that was the entire business and so he had three locations he sold those and then he started uh a coaching business or an education business around helping other people find event spaces rent them out and do the same thing that he did right and so he was like Hey I want to sell this business the way that you sold gym launch and after talking to him I was
(00:56) like dude I think you're going about this all wrong you're trying to sell the Goose when you should be trying to sell the eggs and this will be the common theme throughout this is that most people are trying to sell the goose rather than sell the eggs and you never want to sell the goose you want to keep the goose and let it keep laying golden eggs right so that you can keep selling them and for those you who don't know the story of the the goose and the golden egg uh I'll read it to you it's 2 seconds there was once a countryman who
(01:17) possessed the most wonderful Goose you can imagine for every day when he visited the nest the goose had laid a beautiful glittering golden egg the Countryman took the eggs to the market and soon began to get rich but it was not long before he grew impatient with the goose because she only gave him one egg a day he was not getting rich fast enough then one day after he had finished counting his money the idea came to him that he could get all the golden eggs at once by killing the goose and cutting it open but when the deed
(01:37) was done not a single golden egg did he find and his precious Golden Goose was dead there's something that creates value and then there's the thing that is valuable and so figuring out which of the things that you have in your business is the goose and which of them is the eggs is one of the the highest leverage things that you can do because you can build towards the exit intelligently and so in this business I was like hey man you're getting all these uh people on using your system systems and your processes and your
(02:03) price points I was like you're doing all the work that a rollup would have to do if they acquired a bunch of these businesses I was except you're doing it up front and so why don't you know this ahead of time and say Hey I want to build so that I can have the hundred or 500 or thousand of my students who are using my system for doing event spaces I should use all of those guys and I should set it up ahead of time saying hey use these colors and use these systems and use these price points and in the future if you're successful if
(02:35) you're the top 10% of the students here I have an opportunity where you can roll up and sell with me in a group of 20 or 50 of these and so here's the thing if that's the business model then you can just roll up 20 to 50 every other year and have a massive exit while you still keep the goose that brings those people in and the thing is is that the goose often is incredibly valuable but not sellable and that's what's that's the difficult part about this right and I'll give you a counter example so for me acquisition. comom is my Goose right
(03:04) like am I going to sell acquisition. comom not really there are some things that I'll talk about in a second about like transactions you can have at the goose level but what what really makes sense for me it's for me to sell the eggs it's for me to sell the subsidiar it's for me to sell the companies that acquisition.
(03:19) comom invests in right so the big picture is understanding what is your goose and what are your eggs so I'll give you a different story so I had a dude who uh who who saying he had a couple Amazon stores you'll notice this recurring theme had a couple Amazon stores and he did well with those and sold the Amazon stores and he started teaching people how to sell you know to start and build Amon Amazon stores and I was like okay he's like so I want to potentially sell this company I was like well the thing is is that this business isn't very recurring it's not very
(03:42) sticky uh it has huge keyman risk with you being the face of it like not a lot of investors would a want to buy it or B if they did they wouldn't b a lot of money for it I was like so why don't you think about a way to get all these people that you're helping start Amazon stores uh bundled together so that they become a sellable asset because the thing is is like just like the event business that guy had already sold three of the event venues we know they're sellable businesses they're very straightforward they're faceless like
(04:07) they're relatively turn key same thing with Amazon stores like they're faceless like another investor can say okay how much does it cost what's my you know what's my yield what's my return going to be over time okay and like these are very sellable things and so it takes a lot less effort to take something that is already very sellable and just think how can I do way more of them or how can I make them bigger rather than try and take something that inherently has a ton of uh key man risk isn't recurring um has a lot of volatility in terms of
(04:34) acquisition like all of those things make it not very attractive to a potential investor real quick if you want to sell your company or make it into a sellable business acis.com just started our Workshop division for companies that we don't own which is just walking through the process that we do to build significantly more valuable companies at an accelerated Pace we have it here at our headquarters in Vegas and so if that sounds interesting you go to acquisition.
(04:57) comom hit scale and follow the steps and if you qualify our guys will be in touch so let's get t for a second how do you figure this out with your business so the first thing is is that is there something that's dependent on you if anything is dependent on you for the business it's inherently going to be significantly less valuable number one number two is there a component of your business or of your customers businesses that's very stickier recurring so for example gyms micro gyms for gym launch intrinsically they they don't get sold very often so there's not
(05:26) a market for small service-based facilities like person training Studios things like that a lot of people don't want to buy that why because they have keyman risk at their level too right whereas if I had if I were helping uh franchise chains of restaurants like subway uh you know improve their profitability then there would be a clear exit path because franchise that are existing trade all the time same thing for accounting firms because they have high Revenue retention and so basically if you look at all the
(05:52) different things that exist in your business whether it looks at your customers you look at different service lines that you offer within your business and then the overall watching business itself one of those things should have some level of Revenue that sticky and that doesn't require a face and there there's a lot of other factors but if I had to like pick a couple those would be two um that would be really important that I'd be trying to sus you know pull apart to figure out what is the egg and what is the goose and the
(06:19) easiest way to know if you're right about this is looking for m&a activity so mergers and Acquisitions activity for that type of business so if you look if you Google like coaching business m&a ity one it'll show you how much there is and if you don't find a lot then you'll be like okay maybe there isn't a big market for this number one number two if you do find some what is the difference between those businesses and my business and then you'll be able to bridge the gap and say oh these are the things that
(06:44) these buyers like not these other things and then you can start orienting your effort and your business model around the things that investors have proven that they like what I don't want to go is try and sell a product to a market that doesn't exist so you have to zoom all the way back out and think of your business as a product and an investor or potential acquir as a customer and so somebody might listen to this and say okay well what about gym launch like gym launch was uh that type of business well the one thing is that gym launch was
(07:10) really dangerously close to being a franchise and so I knew what franchise laws were and so I purposely like name system fee by the ways what you need to be a franchise name as in everybody's under the same name system everyone use same systems and there's a fee Associated and so if you have all three you have a franchise and if you don't have a franchise and you're doing all three of those things you have an illegal franchise uh which means you're actually subject to getting sued and all that kind of stuff and so if you're in
(07:33) the business of helping people do a specific type of business you either have to pick uh name and system with no fee which most people don't do right but you could do that you could go name and fee like CrossFit for example like they have a name and there's a fee but they give No Business Systems right or you go systems in fee but no name right which was gym launch we didn't tell everyone that they had to unify under one flag now one of my potential ideas that I was thinking about for gym launch in the future was maybe I will start a
(07:58) franchise off the side of it and with the best people I'll plug them into there now and that will be covered under franchise law right but the reason that Jim launch was sellable is that the big things that everybody needed which was that keyman was removed so I was no longer involved in the delivery I was no longer involved in the ads I had a leadership team in place right all of those things the the recurring Revenue it is recurring Revenue business we did have relatively good annual retention um of customers uh and we had multiple
(08:25) acquisition channels and over time I grew gym launch to be bigger than me at the time and here's a here's a nugget that people don't don't get you see me now and you see Jim launch right the thing is is that this Dynamic of the size of of me and audience you know influence now uh and JY launch like I am bigger than gym launch now when I sold gym launch gy launch was much bigger than me and so that's the big thing that people Miss is that like if you're bigger than the company you will always be keyman risk for the business now in
(08:53) that instance you can sell the goose if you are bigger but you usually have to sell a minority and what that means is like people aren't going to take a risk that you're going to leave but you're saying I want to take chips off the table or I want to either fund an acquisition or I want to like expand in this way and so an investor will happily Bet On You by investing in your business that's what raising money is fundamentally and so if I had so like acquisition.
(09:18) comom I probably can't exit acquisition. comom nor would I really want to because I'm associating myself so strongly with it for such a long period of time but what I could do is I could raise money off acquisition. comom and say look at all of our Holdings and I'm going to sell 5% or 10% of acquisition.
(09:33) comom at a monster valuation so that I can either take chips off the table if I wanted to or more realistically I would say I want to go buy this massive company and I want investors to help me do that and look out it will add uh value to all the other Holdings that we have so we'll get a disproportion return on it right that me doing that isn't really an exit it's a transaction or a liquidity event but it's not me leaving the business like you look at Beast Industries right like uh with uh with Jimmy uh Mr Beast he he
(10:00) raised at the holdco level so that means that Beast Burger the the the software he has uh Feasta bles all of them are under that big thing and so he's not he can't exit his YouTube channel but he can sell a portion of it to fund more growth which is what raising money is and so he's be able to do that if you look at um look at Elon right Elon is inpally linked with the companies that he has and so his way of doing that is like they're mostly public companies uh with the exception of SpaceX and so by doing that the public participates but
(10:31) he's not leaving he's the owner of the business he's still running the business but he allows other people to participate in the growth of the company overall so back to smaller businesses so I had a a media company um that reached out to me and was like hey I'm trying to figure out um like how I structure my media company to become sellable he had a number of stars or talent in his in his kind of like stable right and so if you're in that business you basically need to pick one of two directions so either you get all of the guys in the
(11:03) stable to support a product so they'd be like hey this is our hair gel this is our dip this is our whatever right and ideally you want that consumable to be a recurring thing something that and when I say recurring it doesn't have to be recurring but it can also be reoccurring meaning uh if I use hair gel I might not want to have a subscription for it but if I when I run out I buy more of the same thing like I'm not a recurring subscription for Coca-Cola products but I do Buy cocaa stuff on a reoccurring basis and so if
(11:33) you get enough exposure then people will buy that right and so the idea here is that for him either has to have a product or he sells advertising space and The Impressions that he's able to consistently generate become the product right like so if you're a media company it's one of those two things you're either you're either pushing all of that those Impressions that you're getting from your stable into one product you own or you're saying I'm going to let any advertisers come in as long as it makes sense for our brand or the brand
(12:00) of the talent uh to place ads on their and I'm selling media space itself those are the two ways that that business would work now if he wanted to exit that business he can't exit the Stars the stars are what generate The Impressions now if he's not a star he could exit the business if he has the stable of stars and he's selling advertising space but if I were him I would say well I would rather just have this incubator where I could just blow up uh products and again which one's the goose which one's the eggs in this instance having all this
(12:29) massive media and Impressions and whatnot that's the goose and then the eggs would be the products that we'd sell through that distribution Now using the strategy I was saying before he could raise money by saying I'm going to sell 10% so I can front all the capital for this massive launch because if you have a ton of Impressions is one of the big issues that a lot of creators have is that their the their Impressions and their Fame far surpass their wealth and so in order for them to accommodate the demand that they have they'd have to
(12:57) basically have a ton of money they don't have to Buy in inventory um and get you know third like Logistics set up and like all these other things up front to do it right right because you want to do a good job because you can only have one reputation and so they have to front all this stuff and if you don't have money it gets very hard right and so that's where sometimes having like you're not exiting your brand before you have the product you take a tiny bit you give it to somebody else so they can bet on you
(13:21) and then you can put that money towards something that will make everybody more money now um I'll give you a fourth example of this so I had an accounting firm uh kind of like coach consultant whatever you want to call it reach out and um he was like hey I'm trying to think about the ultimate version of my business now his business was a business World role it made a lot of sense because there's a lot of m&a activity in the accounting space um for a variety of reasons but one of them is that uh the book of business is just worth a lot of
(13:47) money there's usually high gross margins or net margins in the business uh it's incredibly recurring and sticky like people don't normally switch who they're doing their taxes with year to year to year and so they have massive ltvs um the hardest part of the business bus's acquisition is getting customers but get keeping customers is actually not too difficult in that business as long as you do a good job and so he was like how do I sell my accounting firm coaching Consulting thing and I was like well that's not what you want to sell because
(14:11) no one's buying that but what people are buying is accounting firms in glob together and so the the top version of your business is having a rollup of 10 20 accounting firms that you can exit every one or two years and exit for 100 million bucks or whatever and you take your slice and you say hey I'm the one who's putting this deal together and I get 20% get 30% whatever and if you're thinking about this and you're like well why would somebody give up that kind of percentage well here's how it works so when you buy in bulk right when you go
(14:38) buy toilet paper or Costco as a consumer when you buy in bulk you get a discount like the more you buy the less you pay per roll that makes sense what's interesting is that in investing it's a volume premium so basically the more profit you have the bigger the company is the bigger the rollup is the more you get per and it's because big money is lazy and so they will pay a premium to not have to do as many deals because deals are costly it cost a lot of time a lot of attention and so if you have to do a 100 deals versus doing one deal
(15:04) you'll pay a premium to only have to do one deal and so if those individual accounting firms could sell at call it uh four times earnings on their own right if they can sell in aggregate together for call it 12 times earnings then even if they give up 30% of the 12x they're still double as good as they were before and so everybody wins and the thing is is that I spend a lot of time trying to find those types of situations in business where it's like literally everyone wins it's like if we work together rather than be competitive
(15:34) if we can collaborate and I'm telling you all the guys that I know who make gobs and gobs and gobs and money like it's so rare that you're actually competing against people like I used to say this in the weight loss world I was like we're not competing against each other guys like because I had obviously a big community of gym owners and we had tons of gyms that are on the same Market I was like guys we're competing against the couch like we're competing against Netflix we're not competing like we're competing against chocolate like we're
(15:56) not we're not competing against each other right like it's it's only I think it's like 11% of Americans like have a gym membership it's still a tiny percent of people who go to the gym and and that's have a membership not even use their membership and so I mean just look at how many fat people there are like it's not like it's not like the problem doesn't exist right and so people get really obsessed about their competition rather than just thinking okay how can we collaborate and we can all get better because the thing is is that the private
(16:18) Equity buyer the ultimate person at the top of this food chain who who uh Aggregates fragmented Industries those guys don't think like small business owners they just think think oh this is really fragmented I'm going to roll all these together and make a much bigger thing they don't care that you have some sort of animosity cuz they just remove both Founders who have egos and say cool these two work well together and I can see some synergies in terms of cost and I can get more profit and own more of the market they just
(16:44) don't think about it like that and so all the richest guys I know are just like like it's so funny because there's these these these blood feuds that exist between businesses that are local but like the guys who you eventually sell to if you you know succeed and do a good job with it those guys don't care at all and they just roll everything together anyways and so we have this whole Obsession about like competing but like the reality is that if you collaborate you end up making a lot more money I'll tell you another quick example on this
(17:08) so there was a dental association that we were looking really heavily into so they had like 700 uh dentists that were in their Association and dentists have to buy like floss and toothbrushes and toothpaste and whatever you know other stuff they need right and so they spend like 20 30,000 a year on kind of like consumable products that they have to use in their practice and so what they did was they did a co-op in terms of group buying so they said hey let's all come together rather than be competitive let's collaborate and let's buy together
(17:34) as one and by doing that they're able to negotiate a big discount in rates and so the discount that those guys would save in buying together exceeded the cost of the annual membership which by the way brilliant model and so like as long as you plan on being in business why would you not want to have a savings that's in excess of the cost of an association which if you ever have the opportunity to do that like I said great model especially in a niche and so they they did exactly what I'm talking about is that he took the top you know 11 of the
(18:00) of the dentists rolled them up and they sold it for 120 million but the PE group damned them was extra smart we were bidding against them um for the business was like hey you know what we'll buy your business too while we're at it because we'll buy your goose and the eggs because they all they saw was wait you have 700 other dentists in here well that's our that's our egg pipeline for the next 5 years and so they just was like cool so we'll do this roll up and we'll pay you a a premium on your uh Revenue which was actually recurring to
(18:29) be in in defense of this business which is again why it was sellable because they just knew that they're like okay well we'll do this rollup but next year we'll just grab another 20 of them or another 50 of them and keep add adding it together and so the thing is is that the most valuable version of that business wasn't actually that business it was the eggs of that business and so making sure that you understand which is the goose and which is the eggs for the business that you're building then I can Orient my whole business to shoot out as
(18:53) many of these eggs as I can and by doing that you have a goose that lays golden eggs and ideally you hold on that goose and you pet that little Goose as long as you can

Transcript:
(00:00) hi my name is alex ramosey and i own acquisition.com and our portfolio companies will do 85 million this year what i want to talk about today is one of the the pivotal moments of my life that that took me from uh really just getting into a head-on collision in a dui and having basically no money to my name to you know 12 months later having three million dollars in profits not knowing what to do with it there was a series of decisions that happened in that period of time that radically transformed my life and so i want to
(00:30) talk to you about one of the more significant ones today and so uh kind of like i just alluded to leading into my dui head-on collision i had six gyms two with one partner i had uh four three with another partner and then i had one on my own so i had all these kind of weird arrangements that were going on in my life at that time um i also had a partner that i was doing a 50 50 split for dental agency work and another and the same partner we also had an agency together for chiropractic agency work i'm also doing in-person gym launches so
(01:07) that means that i'm i was flying out in person and doing gym turnarounds and trying to launch gyms and at the time i was so stressed that i was drinking i mean probably half a bottle every night just to honestly not to get drunk but just to not be stressed it took me a really long time to just even like function you know what i mean in the morning because i was so spread thin mentally and what i want to kind of talk you through is some of the decisions and how i thought through them because i don't know where you're at right now and
(01:37) it doesn't really matter what the scale is of what the decisions are because i've made decisions like this at multiple times my life i ended up going to an attention coach i know that sounds ridiculous but i went to a coach to help me manage my attention and so one of the things that i think us as entrepreneurs we think about all the time is like you know we're managing our time we're trying to be productive and i worked every hour of the day that i was awake and yet i still didn't have that much money at the time everything was tied up
(02:00) and you know the gyms and all that kind of stuff and cash flow for employees and all that kind of jazz and this uh this coach had kept telling me he's like you need to you know you need to aggregate your attention you need to focus he's like you're spread all over the place i pretty much just like would nod along and and listen and i tried to do some of the stuff they told me to do but um i wasn't making i mean i was making some progress uh but it wasn't until uh i uh drank so much that i ended up uh getting into a head-on collision about
(02:27) 60 miles an hour on the highway uh and i actually walked away um from that and uh it wasn't i didn't hit anyone i was actually getting pulled over and there was a car that was in this in the side the shoulder that was turned off it was dark and so i was looking over my shoulder um and just kind of going from lane to lane as i was you know getting into the shoulder as i was getting pulled over as i was getting pulled over by the cop in the shoulder there's a black car and i just i nailed it and so anyways uh they
(02:54) say that because i was drunk i was really relaxed and that's why i didn't get any injuries who knows but anyways i stepped out of the car you know i'm i'm getting whatever they do you know sign you know sign paperwork whatever and um the next day uh after layla picked me up from jail as my girlfriend not um not my wife at the time she was like this guy's a real winner anyways and so she picks me up and uh the next day i have a conversation with him obviously and he's like he's like your lack of making decisions is going
(03:27) to kill you and i remember him saying that to me and he was like the reason you're stressed is because you have all these decisions that you know you should make and you're not making them i wanted to make this because uh i wanted to talk about probably the the the second hardest decision i made in my life the hardest decision was quitting my job probably the second hardest decision was was the decisions that i had it was a multitude of decisions that i had to make that i knew i was supposed to make and i just didn't know how to
(03:51) confront them and it seems like it's a common theme in my life that when i only make decisions when i'm literally confronted with my own mortality and so if you notice that as a common theme among my stuff it's because for some reason i can't get myself to decide to do things unless i literally think i'm going to die and so i saw this and it became the the catalyst for me making a number of changes in my life and so what i did over the next you know really the next 48 hours was a rapid series of decisions that consolidated all my
(04:18) attention into one thing and so that's what i want to talk to you about so the first thing i did i called up the partner that i had the two agencies with and i said hey i can't do this i'm doing gym agency work where i'm flying out and doing turnarounds i'm doing dental agency work and we're doing chiropractor agents where i was like i can't do any of it so i'm i'm just i'm out i just was like i'm out you can have everything i'm done it was like okay um and that was a horrible conversation to have because i felt like i was
(04:46) letting a partner down and then i called up um the partner that i had in uh in in in the the multitude of gyms more of the gyms um and i said hey you know how can we figure out a way for us to you know walk away i want to do this gym launch stuff um and so you know we ended up working it out and i basically gave away the gyms at fire sale numbers more or less i was able to sell uh two of them successfully in a for a better number but the rest of them i pretty much just gave away and then uh the partner that i had that i was in the
(05:22) new gym with i said you know hey i'm i'm i don't i don't want to do this anymore i need to focus on on gym launch obviously all those conversations did not go you know super well they weren't super well received but i think i just was only able to have the courage to do it because i had almost died the night before and so it just gave me this massive perspective where i was like am i i'm so afraid of letting these people down that i that i might die and so i um i ended up making that all those decisions just in a matter of like a day
(05:53) or two and having those conversations and so i think the the the lesson for me um that i've taken with me that's been the most valuable thing of this is one you won't die when you make those those calls but second a lot of times i feel like when i was a newer entrepreneur and even as i feel that as i accumulate unmade decisions right i think we accumulate these unmade decisions or unma un unconfronted conversations and what happens is there's like a portion of my brain in my decision making my thinking power that
(06:24) just gets allocated to this chunk this this decision right that needs to be made that is unmade that i know i should make and i probably know what the right call is but it's just sitting there unmade and so it's like as we start accumulating these things it's like my my actual amount of of thinking power continues to decrease until you get to the point where you're so reactive because you have no brain power and there's a small like corollary to that i don't know if you've ever like if you remember when you were a kid and you had
(06:49) like homework or something like that and you were like staring at a math problem you can figure it out and um and you know you you're staying up late into the night and you're like whatever i'm going to go to sleep and see if i can think about the morning and then you wake up the next day and you feel refreshed and and you look at the problem and it seems obvious you're like oh it does here it is and then it's done right um i feel like that is the that is an expression of having far more attention far more decision making power far more
(07:16) thinking power um because you can concentrate on this one thing and all of a sudden it seems easy and i think that business and life are a lot like that at least they have been for me where it's like if i feel like like simple decisions are are take an inordinate amount of effort it's because i'm too distracted i have too many things too many unmade decisions too many unconfronted conversations that i need to have and um those can be life conversations with a spouse it can be conversation with parents they can be conversations
(07:41) with siblings they can be conversations with business partners they make conversations with employees they can be decisions that must be made and i think one of the power most powerful things that that i've tried to remember is like i'm only one decision away from changing my life just one decision i'm one decision away from from changing my life i can quit my job that is one decision right i can start a business that is one decision these are decisions that we have to make at some point in our life and these are like the
(08:02) crossroads there's two kind of major major themes that i have one is that most people don't regret doing things they regret not doing things and so i know that when i die i don't want to regret not having done things i'd rather do things than fail so that i do not have the regret and i'll have the experience and having that kind of thought process has been extremely helpful for me to draw back to the point of this this whole thing when i made these decisions and layla was with me because she basically said as well after i got off
(08:28) the phone call with the coach she was like if you don't change things she's like i'm not like this this has got to change like i'm not going to be around she kind of indicated that she didn't say it directly but i think i understood i could read between the lines and i valued my relationship with her uh more than a lot of the other things that were going on in my life and i could tell that she was a little bit outside of the storm that was alex hermosie at the time the storm of chaos and so she was like you have to make these
(08:54) calls and so i made these calls physically like phone calls and also these decisions and what resulted next was really the you know i had to suffer the pain of the consequence of those decisions which was very hard for me um but i felt determined that i had made those decisions i felt confident and i felt like i had more attention and more bandwidth at my disposal because i had made the tough calls and i started believing in myself more because i was like man if i can make these calls then i can do this next thing and so that was
(09:21) kind of i would say the explosion that created the beginning momentum of like i can do this after i basically shut down as many different side projects as i could um that's when i went all in on gym launch and so gym launch actually was started in 2016 which was probably 2016 into the first half of 2017 was like the worst 18 months of my entire life and that was also when i coincidentally met layla my wife so she saw me at the absolute worst and for some reason decided to stay with me because she believed which is why
(09:51) she'll always have my my eternal gratitude we made this call i i ended three partnerships um i sold sold or let go of fire sold you know at the time i guess if you if you were just trying to number those like eleven nine businesses or something that was going on and so this is one of those things where people are like man i have i have i have so many businesses uh you know etc and it's like you have to do them in the right sequence like i didn't even i wasn't barely making any money and i had all these businesses so i could feel good
(10:19) about my status when in reality i knew that i wasn't that successful and so um it was only when layla was like this gym launch thing is working like all we have to do is just give it our full attention and it will work at that point i felt so i want to stay defeated but i also felt like my my slate was clean right i had cleaned the slate and like i pushed everything off the side um in the face of my of my mortality um that the stress of not making these decisions was going to kill me and so um that's when i just focused
(10:48) full in on on on gym lunch and um and things kind of took off and i think in another video i'll tell you that story of how how things actually started there because i think it's valuable for a lot of people who are going through it right now but i guess i wanted to make this video because the the takeaway that i had from that is that i'm always one decision away from changing my life and um i'm often one conversation away um from getting my attention back i'm one decision away from getting all my attention back
(11:14) from where i'm feeling distracted so i don't know where you're at right now but the most valuable thing that we have as entrepreneurs is not our time but our attention if we have all of the time but we have a million things going on we are useless because we have no decision making power we have no thinking power because little pieces of our brain are being allocated these unformed unfinalized decisions um that maybe can cost your life and i don't know i mean it did almost for me which is why i've been so ruthless with my attention since
(11:38) then um and so and had to by by consequence so disciplined with my focus it's not because i'm naturally that way so hopefully this story will illustrate that to you that this was not something that naturally came to me but was a decision that i had to make to save myself and so um don't know where you're at right now my name's alex from rosie we own acquisition.
(11:58) com uh our portfolio companies now do about 85 million a year um i made this channel because a lot of people are broke and i don't want you to be one of them and i think that everyone has 100 within their control to become the top one percent of the united states uh which is already the top whatever percent in the world so anyways what's up everyone um if you did like this hit the subscribe button if you didn't love you either way and i'll see you next video bye

Transcript:
(00:00) if i were 85 years old and i got to go through a time machine and be back in my body as i am now to experience my life from my 85 year old self it's dramatically shifted how i see everything so let me walk you through it i've struggled to feel grateful for most of my life it's not that i don't have things to be grateful for i have tons of things to be grateful for but i don't feel gratitude and so i've tried a lot of different practices to try and feel gratitude you know the journals and the daily meditations and things like that
(00:28) but they've never really stuck that's not to say that they don't work for some people but i want to share with you in this video is one of the most powerful perspective changes that i've ever experienced if you don't know who i am my name is alex romozy i'm the managing partner at acquisition.
(00:41) com which is a portfolio of companies that does over 100 million a year i make these videos because i hope that you make all the money in the world and you experience all the joy that you possibly can in the process i have spoken in the past about the frame of the veteran which i won't recap here but it's really just having different frames or perspectives through which to see circumstances so that you can improve your experience recently i've been trying to toy with one that would create gratitude there's a clip that went pretty viral not that long ago it's also
(01:04) my number one tweet of all time which is when i was 20 i wanted to be a millionaire now that i'm a millionaire i want to be 20. when i'm 85 years old and in my mind i imagine i will be a multi-billionaire at that point i know that i would give up everything that i have of material wealth just to be poor and 20 again i call this the frame of the grandfather or the grandfather frame and it works like this if you've ever looked at pictures from your past and you look at where you grew up or you look at you know your old room or you
(01:34) look at a picture of you with old friends doing something we tend to feel these feelings of nostalgia and i tried to quantify like what is nostalgia so to me nostalgia is gratitude in the present for past circumstances for whatever reason we're able to kind of look past all of the kind of minutia of how we were feeling our moods and we're able to kind of like see big picture the things that we are grateful for take a pause here i'm sure all of us have tons of childhood [ __ ] and things that we wish were different and blah blah blah blah
(02:01) but there are still elements of our past our childhood our adolescence our teenage years our college years whatever it is right where you feel grateful some of you guys are superstars and are always grateful for everything and i'm you know i'm jelly i don't roll that way it's not like i wake up and i'm like man i just want to count my lucky stars like i just don't that's just not how i function and i've been trying this on and i i hope you do too because it's been it's been really like improving my life i tried to do this i wake up
(02:25) thinking to myself if i were 85 years old and i got to go through a time machine and be back in my body as i am now to experience my life from my 85 year old self seeing it again if i wake up and i feel my body and i'm like oh this is so nice i don't have all the joint pain ah my wrists don't have arthritis and then i wake up and i'm like i remember when we used to live here even when i looked at layla this morning i was thinking to myself man like this is my wife right at the beginning of our marriage you know we're
(02:56) only six years in we wake up and we walk over to you know to have our coffee in the morning which we always do and i'm like isn't this so nice i remember when we used to have coffee here together this is great and i look out the window look how young vegas looks it doesn't have all these buildings and these flying cars like it does now it's it's so underdeveloped compared to what it is today and i feel gratitude for an external just environment which i would never really think that but i know that my 85 year old self will totally
(03:19) appreciate those things as i'm going through the day applying that frame also to business where i can see that you know the ceos of our companies and the people that work within our holding company acquisition.com they're stressed about things and in my mind i'm thinking oh isn't this cool that we get to do this together isn't that fun isn't that neat look how cute that is it is the most powerful frame that i've encountered i think the reason it's so powerful is one it operates almost entirely from a frame of gratitude that
(03:43) for me i can feel for whatever reason gratitude journals the meditations things like that like i don't feel that but thinking about my 85 year old self being able to re-experience life through my 32 year old body it's really shifted how i see things and also decreases the amount of anxiety and stress i have over outcomes because i'm like this isn't going to matter in the long run i also think it helps from a business the term loosely but like a business wisdom perspective because when you think about the decisions you think about it within
(04:10) the larger context of your life and you're not like oh yeah i'm going to make that short term dollars because you're like i'm 85. i don't have anything to prove you know what i mean you think about like the really stressful things that you've had happen in your past i feel nostalgia for the sleeping on the floor that i did at my gyms for how tired i used to be at the end of the day of taking 20 plus consoles for months and months and months on end and rather than feeling stressed about it or resenting the fact that i have to do it like i get
(04:35) to do this i get to make videos talking to a camera look at my 32 year old self go trying to make his content trying to help other entrepreneurs like isn't that cool if i had to characterize seasons of my life i would say i was very angry as a teenager and young adult and then i went from angry to being aware of the deficit between where i was and what i considered to be happiness from there i kind of switched to what i have affectionately called the [ __ ] happiness mantra which i lived for a very long period of time which was i stopped
(05:02) trying to optimize for happiness at all and just really stopped thinking about it all together which i think moved me closer to something that i would consider to be joy you can be joyful independent of circumstance because joy is from within happiness tends to come from external right it comes from circumstance and i think when we look at the grandparents or at least the people that are older that i aspire to be they just have an internal joy they have gratitude for being able to live it one last time because the end of
(05:27) the day like it is our last time i'm being real here like i've had a guy that i graduated with died a few months ago and um he was a really successful guy really smart kid did really well i mean this is really dark but he got randomly murdered and you know he had grand plans for his life and i think to myself i'm like you know tomorrow really isn't guaranteed thank you for your attention i know you have a lot of places that you can put it and i am grateful that you chose to share the moment with me so those nation appreciate you guys
(06:00) bye

Why I don't follow my feelings.. - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) if you can expose someone to a stimuli and get a consistent outcome a lot of marketers and sales people like to talk about the internal thoughts that someone's had like first they need awareness and then they need blah blah and then so they're basically just make up they reverse engineer fictitious steps of someone's mental thought process when they have no evidence to support what someone's thinking at all and so i don't find it useful because it's not useful like what are the things that are useful these are the things
(00:28) that are observable that we can drive action towards that that we create an outcome and then we have a feedback loop and so if we have those things then we can move the variables and get closer to where we're trying to go and the feelings although i recognize that they exist they're not helpful in trying to edit what our activities are i would say there are days that i feel like less energized or things like that for sure not about like the big picture of like i don't believe that this cause is not worthy but i do think a lot of
(00:55) people have that too where they're like what i'm doing is meaningless right and then i get into i think everything's meaningless and then we can just create whatever meaning you know we choose to because if we don't believe in a capital m meaning which a lot of people disagree with that's fine but if you don't believe in a capital end meaning i think that's very freeing because then you can create little meaning for whatever you want and so if you believe you can then choose to architect your own life in whatever ways that you deem meaningful
(01:19) and make the activities you do aligned with that meaning the difference between capital m meaning and little meaning and this is kind of like the basis of nihilism which people have like a very negative viewpoint around which i'm not entirely sure about why but like capitalism meaning means that like this is the meaning of life period like for everyone this is the meaning of life whereas if we say that there is no single agreed upon meaning of life and then people say well then that is your big meaning of life and i'm like yes
(01:44) you're right i believe that there is no meaning that is the thing that i that i believe and they're like well then that is the capital then sure that's my capital meaning is that there is no meaning what's the implication of that it means now that we have meaning making machines in our brain and so we get to create and destroy meaning as we see fit and so if we choose an activity and we deem that goal meaningful because we think it's more interesting or it energizes us then we can ascribe meaning to that and do
(02:08) more of it and what's nice about not having capital m meaning is that that can shift right that might be good for a season and then it can shift i will say that the downside of not having capital meaning which i consider to be religion off the shelf is that it's more difficult because you have no one who's saying here's the big box of rules you can read it and then that way you don't have to make the decisions about it but i think it's more difficult but ultimately more rewarding if you have reasoning behind why you believe what
(02:31) you believe because then you have to independently come up with your own conclusions about those things it also makes it malleable so that if you get new data or new evidence then you can change your mind which a lot of people again have difficulty with but like if you change the information then it would make sense that if it materially changes the outcome that you the way that you believe about something should change and i think a lot of people identify with their beliefs as a part of themselves rather than as
(02:57) what i prefer to call them which is assumptions because they work the same way what's the difference in belief and assumption not a lot right the only difference is just what we call the word and so assumptions are based on things that we've observed and then we assume something as a result and so i would say that beliefs are just assumptions and but when you call them that they become less tied to your identity if you have an assumption you don't say you challenged my assumption it's like well hey challenge my assumption oh
(03:20) that's great i i was assuming this it must be this and then they become much more flexible and then we don't tie our egos into them and i think ultimately it serves more people better in the long run i feel passionately about my viewpoint of the world mostly because i struggled and i was in so much pain for such a long period of time i'm only sharing this despite the fact that i get attacked for sharing this because there are people who this does resonate with but when there is no required meaning then a lot of language
(03:47) changes which is should must need have to like all of these things no longer exist because there is no capital m meaning so i don't should have to must need to anything and so a lot of the expectations that we bury ourselves into that weigh us down are just implied shoulds have to's musts and so if all of those disappeared then in a lot of ways it's very liberating and so for me in business it allows me to take actions even though i know that i shouldn't or must not or other people would judge me for not doing it the way that they thought i
(04:21) should do it because there are no rules which is why that was the preference to the book it's like there are no rules we can live our life whatever way we want to live it and that's okay i read a youtube comment the other day it's like hey you know you talk a lot about being sad and like how have you been able to x y and z and i don't identify with being a sad person i think i i have been sad in the past but i also don't think that there's a problem with being sad and so i think that there's just so much power in acceptance it's like so many people
(04:50) make themselves miserable because they think that they shouldn't be who they are and they shouldn't feel how they feel and so much of the medication that gets prescribed right now is because someone's like oh i'm anxious and why do we feel like someone shouldn't be anxious they are human why do we feel like we shouldn't feel sad we are human why do we feel like we shouldn't feel frustrated or angry we are human and so i think it's one of the most like interesting things or phenomena where if you have a line which is the normal
(05:12) human existence and you have points above the line and points below the line you have the median right or the the middle point and people want to not feel the things below the line and then we ascribe or label the things below the line as bad and things above the line is good when all of it is and so i think that if we just accept that and accept ourselves and accept the feelings that we experience as things that we experience like rain and weather and sunshine it's not like rain is bad not like sunshine's good it just is not like happiness is
(05:38) good or happiness is bad or sadness is bad or sadness is good we just label it that way and i think the labels create more suffering than anything that we ever actually experience so when you're sad do you try to not be sad no i actually don't think about it much i think a lot of people spend a lot of time and effort trying to figure out how they feel because they want to then judge or label themselves as i'm doing well or not well like a lot of effort goes into showing like how do i feel about this i mean my follow-up
(06:04) question be like why do you care why does it matter and that's why when you asked way long ago about like how much do you think feelings matter i don't think they matter at all like what would the case for feelings mattering be then why do you believe they exist it's a good question and it gets really interesting because it's like how i experience a feeling that i label in my head is sadness is it the same way you experience the thing that you like it's like seeing green and i see green and you see green what if all of our greens
(06:31) are different right i mean it's it gets very interesting like that but i think that i experienced something and if we were to just measure it based on like brain activity and like heart rate i would say that i become aroused in the literal sense uh from experiencing what i would deem as emotions and so if we were to describe it or define the term in that way i think i experience emotions and so i mean i'm fairly confident i experience emotions if we were to try and measure it that way then that's how i would say yes i do
(06:53) experience them but the question is just like how important are they and then it would be like for what if it's for accomplishment not very important for fitness not very important you know if if we're saying how important is emotion for love which is another emotion right it becomes like amorphous trying to go to amorphous but then you say okay well for defining love by what i'm willing to endure to continue to keep something then how important is it well it depends on how much i've conditioned myself to accept this thing so like if i want to
(07:22) stay married it's probably far more effective to condition someone to stay married because that is the external consequence of a good marriage as you stay together right i'm just saying like we're just purely measuring from out from external circumstances and so i think trying to measure and define things is what i actually geek out on and i really enjoy i think most people get bored of tears when i talk about this stuff so i don't talk about it much but that's the stuff that like um when when we keep peeling back layers of like
(07:46) why do you think you're able to get out of you know a difficult place in your life or why do you think you're able to go through these things a lot of it is because i believe that i will redefine terms and so we'll have some instance or something that i should do and i will redefine it or i'll say i i don't should i can just accept it and that's why the biggest refrain that i have in my head for like my own mental illness is just like and that's okay period like i don't wanna go to that thing that's okay

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on everyone i hope you're having a phenomenal weekend restful time um this podcast is dedicated to all of the uh younger entrepreneurs out there so this is a little departure from the normal business owner but i think that you'll still find value in it if you know any younger entrepreneurs or you have uh you know teenagers or kids or you know college you know college-aged people slash maybe even people in their 20s 30s right who are getting into business and so maybe you left your job and you're getting into business now
(00:26) whatever right this would apply to you and it's regarding expectations and i think that expectations are literally the thing that will destroy your life uh or will make your life and many of us uh i think many people in general have you know figured out and many world religions have figured this out which is you know the secret to happiness is uh haves over wants which is let's say you have you know have one thing and you want nothing you will be infinitely happy the problem is where you might have a million things
(01:01) but you want two million things and you will not be happy right and so you can simply change how happy you are by expecting less and so one of the things that i specifically wanted to address today was the expectations around education and the reason this is a really meaningful topic for me is that i've i think i've talked to you about my neighbor and watching him go through the the crazy expectations that he has as a young person has been really valuable for me because i've also seen a lot of those characteristics that he has in myself
(01:32) just add zeros to it but it's still fundamentally the same thing and that's what's been uh it's been meaningful for me and so anyways uh i have tried to frame things uh so if you are trying to learn things which is going to be the first step to any kind of entrepreneurial endeavor is i like to liken everything to a bridge because i think it's a simple visual so imagine where you are on one side of you know this this valley right is where you are and where you want to go is on the other side of this big valley right and you
(02:04) have a bridge that goes across the two sides now the problem is is that people will buy things they will buy courses they will buy mentorships they'll buy workshops they'll buy seminars they'll buy events they'll buy whatever right in an effort on some level to get over this bridge right of where they are to where they want to go and it could be from zero to a hundred thousand dollars a year it could be from a million dollars a month to two million dollars a month it could be from a hundred million dollars a year to a billion dollars a
(02:31) year whatever it is there's a bridge right and along that bridge are bricks and i like to liken um each skill as a brick on the way to where you're trying to go and the problem with the expectations of somebody who's trying to learn a skill or achieve a goal is that they have a binary outcome i either achieved it or i did not i either am making a hundred thousand dollars or i am not and the problem is it can be incredibly frustrating because if you have a binary outcome uh then it's very easy to get a zero out of one right
(03:07) where the reality is most things are exist on a continuum and so this is the difference between a psychological binary and a and the biological continuum which is i'll give you a couple of examples so it's not uh uh are you diabetic or you're not diabetic it's how diabetic are you right it's not uh are you smart are you dumb but it's how smart are you right and so we like to psychologically bucket things into yes knows because it's simpler for us but it it it misses actual reality right and this can be especially dangerous as
(03:41) we're trying to acquire new skills and so the reason i liken this and i think it's so dangerous in education uh because that's what we're doing right if we're trying to educate ourselves we're trying to acquire skills is that we think as we're trying to get across this bridge that let's say you buy a course on copywriting right and so you're on one side of the bridge you buy a course on copywriting and then you still aren't a millionaire wow right the problem is uh you may have put another brick on your bridge you may be closer
(04:10) to where you were to getting to the other side of the bridge you just haven't achieved it yet and so this is one of the issues that i also see um just in general like it's so funny because in the in the in the i'll say guru world um you know people will take on a coach that coach will move them forward you know to a certain degree and then they'll take another coach and that coach will move them forward to a certain degree and so forth and so on and then the thing is is that they're they're like i'm working with so so i used to work
(04:35) with that person they suck right but the problem and i used to do this right like and this is why i think it's so ridiculous um is that like if you were looking at your schooling right and you had a had a third grade math teacher and then later you had a calculus teacher you wouldn't be like screw that third grade you know uh math teacher the stuff that i'm learning from this guy is so much you know more advanced whatever right and i've had a lot of our clients say that about their franchises that they work with and things like that and i
(05:02) just it it drives me nuts because it's it's it's stupid you know it's for lack of it's stupid because a lot of times you need you need step one to get to step two right and you don't have to and p it's because people have psychological issues but like they they can't they can't say i've learned from all of these people right and it doesn't it doesn't decrease your status to say i've learned from many teachers look at all the richest people in the world they say like i've had multiple mentors i've had so many people help me out over the
(05:30) years and i think if you can shift that perspective it will be incredibly valuable for you but one of the other things that's so poisonous about especially in the like the quote make money world is that if we if if everyone in the world viewed college because i think about this a lot i'm like why is it that people will spend two hundred thousand dollars four years of their lives study you know aztec literature of the 1700s and get to the end and not in any way be upset about the fact that they're not making money when they
(05:58) graduate they can't even get a job like why is that and the only reason that i can come up with is that they didn't expect to right and so that's it like that's the difference is that people come in and part of that is because the marketing messaging and the sales and all that kind of stuff so don't be wrong like the reason that you know the big academic uh powerhouse has been able to stay there well one is because they got the government to get on board and give away free money so that's obviously one part of it but the other part of it is that
(06:25) when people are coming in they they expect nothing like nothing literally they're not expecting anything they expect to get a check mark next to the name that says you have a diploma congratulations right and so uh if my my my my request of everyone um and i've requested this of myself is that when i go into trying to learn something that i do not give myself a binary outcome of uh did this work or did not work but instead give myself the question am i closer or further away from my goal and i think that has been tremendously
(06:57) helpful i've i've spent i mean recently i i spent 50 000 on uh i think eight hours with someone uh it was different than uh the the grant cardone one that i did um that's that was four hours for 120 000 if you're curious um and honestly i got enough value in the first hour that i was like i don't know what i'm going to do with the next three calls um with grant it was really good um but the point is this you know with the other one that i that i did it was actually to have assistance on a higher level project that i was working
(07:26) on and about halfway through i realized that um it was not a priority uh for me and so i could either say this got me you know i'm not gonna be like hey screw this guy right or anything like that it was just um for me if i can get the perspective that something is not a priority that is valuable in and of itself and so does that take me closer or further to my ultimate goal closer and so why would i be satisfied and so shifting uh our education expectations to is this another brick on the bridge to where i'm trying to go
(07:55) or instead of excuse me instead of am i at my destination or not and i think that this is probably one of the biggest things that you can do uh or like that it's or it's been useful for me and this is what i've tried to shift my neighbor's perspective uh for himself on which is it's kind of alignment with that kind of investor mindset which is if i were to look over a five year time horizon and i were to continue to acquire skills like this would i and i put more and more bricks on my bridge uh by the end of that period
(08:25) would i be better or worse off and likely it'd be better but you will be worse off if you keep trying to build a new bridge right and that's why when you jump from opportunity to opportunity a lot of times you can never get to where you're trying to go because you take two steps of progress and say oh i'm not there binary outcome therefore i will start something else and it's only after failing three four five six things then on the seventh thing you had enough acquired skills from your first six failures that you were
(08:48) actually able to make it all the way across the bridge and that's what's kind of interesting about this is that like there are plenty of people who uh you know have come to us and immediately start making a lot of money right and then they and then they're like oh my god gem lunch is awesome and the thing is is that like i we don't honestly deserve all the credit because you probably like some of these people may have gone through three four five courses that they believe failed them when in reality there may be 38 skill
(09:15) sets that they need to create their their business you know core skills and they may have acquired 24 of them from other people and we just happen to be able to get them the last 14 that gets them all the way across but because they have a binary outcome expectation they then attribute all the credit to us and i don't think that's fair um you know uh to themselves in terms of their their mental space but also to everyone else that they've worked with right and so i think thinking about it this way has been really helpful and especially and
(09:45) this is again i mentioned the franchisor one earlier but i'm gonna say it again i i can't tell you the amount of facilities specifically that worked with the franchisor and then said you know started working with us started making more money and we're like i hate my franchisor you got you know like screw them blah blah blah but the reality is that many times they wouldn't have even survived long enough without the the fundamental bricks that have been laid by the franchisor with their business model there's so many fundamentals that
(10:10) they may not even been aware of and mistakes that they would have made that were avoided because the franchisor got them 70 percent of the way across the bridge right um and we just got them the last 30 right and so um another perspective on this as well is that let's say you've got two people who all have who both have all 38 bricks on this bridge right on the on the path of your opportunity vehicle you're trying to pursue to get to the other side right now let's say both of them have all both all 38 bricks
(10:40) but with your learning style and their teaching style you're only able to accurate or you know absorb 25 of the first guys right it's kind of the same thing right it's like for some reason like you know i maybe the first one you worked with taught you how to sell but like you it didn't absorb or wasn't real for you and then later on in your life uh it was able to be real for you and then you attribute your success uh to the second person when in reality the first person helped you along the way and so um this
(11:10) has just been really valuable uh for me from a shift in perspective in my overall happiness um but also just in thinking about outcomes and what what what do i believe is reasonable and i think i've been i've been asking myself this question much more frequently which is do i believe my expectations are reasonable and is there a way that i can lower them and uh there's there's difference between lowering your expectations of the performance you want of people i believe you should be absolutely intolerant of people who do not want to be world class
(11:39) at something uh or you should be intolerant of any lack of effort but if you can maintain absolute intolerance to anything but excellence but then also decrease your expectations of the outcome then that is going to be a winning formula so increase expectations on activity and actions decrease expectations on outcomes and i think that that is a formula for business success just as uh haves over wants is a formula for happiness in life and so anyways i figured i would share that with you um just quick quick recap of
(12:14) takeaways try not to think about things at least for me this has been valuable i have shifted to going from binary is this good is this bad two how good is it and instead of thinking uh this is what needs to happen is is a first is that a reasonable expectation and b can i lower it and b and c can i raise my expectations of the activities that i would be willing to take to make my very low expectation so believably reasonable to achieve that i should hopefully surpass it and so um i think when we go into uh expectations
(12:46) around education and skill acquisition and thinking about things on the the continuum of am i closer or further from my goal as a result of this decision uh many times we will think much more favorably about our experience and be significantly less frustrated with what might be perceived as a momentary uh quote setback which isn't even a setback it's only a setback because we think it is rather than i am 22 of my 38 steps along the way and i just need to continue to identify which are the bricks that i am missing to get me to my
(13:17) goal which is ultimately the role which is why so many you know billionaires etc talk about having good mentors because they can look at your skill set they can look at your bridge and say this is what's missing this is what you need and the thing is is that when it's sometimes that last brick it's that one thing that you need that you didn't see and then all of a sudden you tribute all your success to that person when in reality it was because you spent four years building the other bricks so anyways hope that was valuable for you
(13:41) hope that made sense uh keeping awesome and uh having a happy and productive life all right lots of love stay real [Music] [Music] [Applause] you

I Sold My Company at 31: My Detailed Breakdown of the Decision - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) we're all one decision away from massively changing the direction of our lives we can take one drink and get into our car we can sleep with someone that we shouldn't have and destroy marriage um or we can quit a job or we can sell a company and so one of the things that's always been interesting to me is that billionaires millionaires hundred thousand heirs people who are have zero dollars people who are in massive debt the only real thing that distinguishes these people is the quality of their decisions and so what i wanted to do in this video is walk you through the decision process that i went through in
(00:30) selling the majority stakes of three companies for 50 million dollars last year um and my name is alex mosey and so i i make this stuff because i want to document the journey mentally for me because i think i'm going to forget the details of these things as i age and like kind of what i was thinking and and the different pieces of it and so i made this little presentation based on notes uh because i actually took really extensive notes throughout this entire process of what i was thinking through you know different variables i was considering because this is not a an instant decision the the whole process
(00:59) for me actually took almost 18 months um and a lot of deliberation a lot of back and forth all right and so that's what i'm going to kind of focus on in this video so uh to sell or not to sell so there were seven variables that i looked at one was kind of the story externally and internally the second was money and finances you know for me uh personally third was kind of energy and headspace the fourth was team resources in terms of like what am i going to lose am i going to gain number five is the future and the vision for myself number six was
(01:23) what was the best decision for the business and then number seven i'll loop around and tell you what i ultimately ended up doing and why probably more importantly why all right so my name is dr mosey my wife and i are business investors and we in safe portfolio companies here's your youtube proof because i know there's a lot of people out there so you can just google apg gym launch and you can see all the top results are you know public disclosures of them purchasing making a big investment in the company out of 46 those two were at a 46.2 million evaluation the third sale i can't
(01:48) disclose the number the company did 12 million the year before i'll just tell you that okay so quick backstory i actually ended up writing out the backstory for this in in more detail so this will get you 100 up to speed to the same context as i had so i spent the better part of two and a half years obsessing about a single decision whether or not to sell my business and i'm thankful to tell you that two and a half years later i made that decision so what i want to walk you through is how i made it and hopefully help someone skip the two and half years of mental charging that it took me to get here so let's start with why did i want to sell
(02:17) so let me take you back into a moment that i decided to sell and then bring you forward to this moment so leila and i were on a walk in march of 2019 and we had just done 4.4 million dollars in revenue that month and taking out 1.7 million in owner dividends that month she stopped and she looked at me and she said let's shut it down i don't feel like doing this anymore we don't need the money let's just shut it down and move on and being the motivated money motivated entrepreneur that i was at the time i was like hey now let's at least see if we can sell this all right maybe
(02:41) we can get like a small payday before moving on to our next thing and so i went up and hit my network up and asked anyone if they knew anyone who could help me you know value my business and let me know what somebody might pay for it and that's when a good friend of mine rick mayo introduced me to investment banking friend of his who specialized in our space which was the fitness base at the time um and so within a day or two i was on the phone with a guy named mike okumian and he was a banker in the fitness base and he transacted a handful of high profile
(03:06) deals and after a few introductions i shared our dilemma and asked if there was you know he thought the company could be worth anything and what he told me next really changed my life and so i'm loosely paraphrasing but he said dude you grew from zero to 17 million dollars in profit in two years and you're now on pace to grow fifty percent again this year and i was like yeah i know we're really tired of it though and michael was like uh if you continue this growth at the end of the year he's like i could sell this for 150 million easily
(03:30) and i was like really and he was like yeah and and if you can disassociate your brand uh from your face and maybe get another acquisition channel going probably even more and so my job just about hit the floor right i was used to small business ownership where when you stop wanting to do business you bake someone to buy from you and you're trying to recoup your costs as much as you can get but this was something entirely different right 150 million that's not even rich the generational wealth right and as a reminder i was 28 all right and so my wife and i probably had maybe 20 million
(03:58) bucks saved up at the time but this was an order of magnitude changing wealth for us and so after getting off the phone with michael my head was spinning and i felt like my world perspective had shifted forever and it had from that moment onwards the next two and a half years all i thought about was how do i sell this business for 150 million dollars and interestingly from that moment onwards my business plateaued more or less right i mean we grew but not to the same degree that we were going before and it could have been because i was already burned out which
(04:22) is possible um it could have been because of macroeconomic forces uh because there was a little flu that went around that affected gyms or could have been because i wanted to i shifted from wanting to build something to wanting to sell it and i have no idea all i can say is that i stopped going i stopped growing after that conversation and so i can truthfully tell you that 50 or more of my mental bandwidth for the last two and a half years was dedicated to the idea of selling and what's more difficult about that is i can't really talk about
(04:47) it publicly right and so it's this kind of like this burden that you keep in the back your head that just eats up a lot of your thoughts that you can't talk about right and so what happened was all my decisions changed from what is going to provide me the most long-term goodwill with our customers to what would a potential acquire think of the decision and would it make the company more or less valuable and i think this ultimately hurt my business the heart behind the business had shifted from the process to the outcome and over the next
(05:10) year our revenue went up but our profit dropped because i thought an acquirer would want to see lower churn which is true but i made a terrible mistake and lowered my prices in an attempt to do so and it ended up cutting about five million dollars in profit in the process so i went from 17 million in profit on 26 million top line to the next year i think we did 37 million top line 13.
(05:29) 4 million bottom line which is still obviously not a bad you know outcome but it it should have gone the other way should have gone like 19 million on 37. like i said although we grew by 40 top line my bottom line by 25 and so you know we also thought we needed to show we were legit and hired a lot more people to sit around and do nothing while the core team was still hustling to get the work done either way we had we splunked up to like 135 employees i think at our peak for that those two entities and so either way over the course of 2019 uh we pulled me out somewhat from the fulfillment of product divisions so that was somewhat of a win
(05:56) and then in 2020 we committed to selling the company right so that's kind of like speeding up to 2020 and we knew we could tell the story of the infrastructure cost being something that ate up margin and that we were still growing and we were on pace to you know keep it for a year and show some growth and then sell it concept so we went to market in february of 2020 and right as you guessed it there was this flu that went around kind of affected our business a little bit and we had the option of pulling back but layla and i were
(06:17) honestly you know just like even-handed about being the gym business right we wanted to not have that be the only thing in our lives the bankers ended up adjusting our expectations and said you know i think uh and mind you this was actually we weren't we were no longer working with uh the guy that was uh referenced earlier he actually was just a council like we ended up using a a different firm i think i think we can definitely help you grow yeah and get 45 for this business right and at this point we were
(06:41) fine with that we just wanted out and not really out just more like we wanted our focus back and so over the next three quarters our revenue and profit continued to decline as the fluid raged on and once the second shutdown hit the business really hit rock bottom in q4 so we had gone from like three to four million dollars a quarter in profit to like 500 grand in profit in q4 of 2020 right and so the bankers suggested that we stop the sales process and try you know try again once the flu had gone away
(07:06) right but lately the guy laila and i were kind of yet again really determined to be out of pain and so we told them to just you know keep going with the process and so they hit up all the private equity firms again and lo and behold we got a few replies and some firms were interested in buying our company at rock bottom what a surprise right and those replies after a lot of phone calls and meet and greets and information requests turned out to be two offers for the company and then you know for context i can't show the actual
(07:30) numbers of the trailing uh 12 that they came up to this for 2021 but i can tell you that they just consistently straight line went up um so basically q4 q1 was kind of like the bottom of it like december of q4 of 2020 was like the absolute bottom and that's really because because there was almost no hope you know i mean like it had the second round of shutdowns a lot of gyms had shut down it was just kind of looking bleak no one decided etc and so i'll bring you up to speed kind of internally we realized that we would have to build this business to run on its own because we didn't know if we were going to be able to sell it and we knew we weren't
(08:00) gonna like want to shut it down or something like that there's too many families that relied on us too many employees too many customers like it just it didn't make sense and so beyond that uh tactically we started an outbound call center um so that we can have a second channel so we started to take the steps that we knew we should do and from the feedback that we had from the first round which was like you need a second channel it needs to be less branded to you etc this is important to understand over the next 12 months i stopped attending all product meetings all client-facing calls all
(08:28) client-facing events so i didn't show up to my events like there was nothing we built an outbound call team that did 50 of our sales volume and we promoted a team of generous become the face of the consulting brand overall and so all that remained for me was a weekly 101 with the ceo uh a weekly executive call team that was 90 minutes and quarterly meetups internally so i was no longer public facing at all it was only uh internal that i was kind of facing and so now let's get back to where it was interesting so we signed and accepted an loi and at this point you know the
(08:56) profits had gone up significantly from from kind of the q4 bottom and i have to skip the actual uh numbers of what was around there i can just tell you the the overarching number which was which ended up being 46.2 and so here was the decision-making process and that's what i want to get into which is like okay so what did you guys end up doing and why all right because during this process the business kind of almost shot out of a gun 2021 and kind of had a really strong rebound um that's obviously why there was way more people who were interested first there was two and then there's two more i interested parties and so we had a
(09:26) handful of private equity firms that saw that okay they saw the bottom they saw the the fast rising back and they're like wait we could buy a company that just did you know 15 million in ebitda a year ago or two years ago and we they can bank on the fact that it'll probably do that again let's dive in all right so that's the back story so these are the considerations the story slash milestones that i was telling myself the money energy headspace team resources future vision best decisions for the business and ultimately why i decided
(09:50) what i decided to do i wish i could have given you more visuals for this but but i did this this already took me a lot of time to transcribe all my notes into one presentation and so there was there was two kind of composers i and and it was really kind of having this like devil's advocate in my head conversation that was going back and forth and i even just put these directional arrows to like what i said first and then what i responded with mentally i'm sharing these thoughts with you because i i want to show that like i
(10:14) don't think these thoughts ever go away you know what i mean like i i said and this is like i mean i was like i need a sale to be legit you know as an entrepreneur and then a friend of mine was like dude you already have seven successful exits and a handful for multiple millions right and i was like well yeah he's like you do seven million a month right now like you're legit i was like huh okay uh he's like this is not a reason to sell a business i was like okay that's fair um i was like but a big exit is an entrepreneurial rite of passage right and he's like so jeff bezos stuck elon they're not legit
(10:43) because they didn't exit their businesses i was like that is also a good point i was like well there's kind of like the four-minute mile component like there's no e-learning companies that really sell for you know or personality-driven brands that that are selling for these types of numbers not many at least and so i could prove that you know these types of models are sellable i was like well can i just prove that i have a higher net worth and keep it i was like that's also not a good idea or not good reason to sell it you know another story was like you can't have more than one thing and so
(11:08) that's why you should sell but you know in terms of keeping it's like well you just need to level up your skill set like there are it is not physically impossible there are other entrepreneurs who do this and so you just need to be better and this is just a great growth opportunity so that's not a good reason to sell i'm like all right fair i was like ah it's a big nice few to everybody who doubted and you know spoke out against me over the years and then it's just like you're better than that that's also not a good reason to sell so i'm showing this stuff very candidly you can reinforce uh the
(11:33) lesson of selling my gyms and so the big lesson there and this is one that i've spoken about a lot is that you know sometimes you have to give up what you have in order to give up uh to get the bigger thing that is unknown so you have to you have to let go of something that you do know that is good in front of you for something that you don't know that could potentially be great and it kind of hinges on the idea that what we don't do are the things that we regret rather than the things that we do and then fail at that was that's kind of the story uh
(11:57) there and the keeping argument that is like well that might be the wrong lesson to learn like maybe you needed to exit those things but it doesn't mean you need to exit everything it's making sure that we apply the correct lesson to the story and that might not be the right lesson from that story i was like okay that's fair and then you know finally doing a sale early selling the the majority uh portion of the business would unbrand me somewhat from the fitness industry because it's it's still something that drives me a little nuts
(12:20) it might also be because of how i look so that's possible just being real like i still see comments are like hey man i still find your content valuable even though i'm not a gym owner and i'm like i haven't made a gym piece of content in three years i'm glad like it's just funny and i consciously made that decision in 2019 when i rebranded my podcast from gym launch secrets uh and i hadn't spoken about your stuff in a while but i consciously rebranded it to the game which you can check out if you want and so my keeping
(12:45) story around that is like people have already moved out from that dude like a handful of comments is not like what everyone thinks about right you're not just like some gym dude you already have the majority of your money is made outside of gyms now i was like well yeah but people don't know that and so anyways these are the stories i was telling myself at this time right and so next is kind of like what are the what are the money money things that i was telling i was like okay well selling cash would be nice but the keeping argument is uh well after it you'll have
(13:07) a tax event so you'll actually be you'll have to give a portion of that to the government it'll actually net decrease your net worth because you already have that value and equity and because of the amount of money you already have so my wife and i at this point are probably taking from those two businesses about 45-ish million in dividends it's not really going to materially change your your living um which is true other thing though is that from a selling perspective it's like i can i can take that cash and then i can reinvest it and then all i have to do is just make the
(13:33) delta right so it's like i can take you know whatever cash i've received there i can invest it and then i can build something else and what i'd have to do is make up the net difference between what i do on my own what my cash grows into versus what that 66 would be worth in five years right and so that's the that's the net delta difference and i was like i feel like that would be still a pretty strong argument for uh doing the sale the flip side is what am i going to buy that's going to make me the same amount of money that i could from this company that's clearly going to you know triple
(14:05) and then you know triple in value and go back to what it was worth um you know pre-flu fair argument on the on the other side it's like well you're super super concentrated you know diversification is not a bad diversification's not a bad idea and then i quoted warren is a hedge against ignorance do you feel like you're in this space do you feel like you don't like that the the companies that you have you don't know anything about um well no i actually feel like i know more about the stuff that i'm doing okay well
(14:28) then you don't need to have diversification just go all in on the things that you know and then they will grow disproportionately which candidly my life is an example of that so it's hard to argue against that point you know rich people sell wealthy people never sell another argument for keeping it yeah uh i could also take out debt and still continue to own the whole thing kind of refinance the business and still keep 100 ownership if i did that but the problem for me from that perspective is i knew that i would never do that because i was already very tired at that point in running an entire another process from scratch was something that i just knew i wasn't
(14:56) going to be willing to do at least not on any short time horizon i was like okay well you can still do debt to fuel like m a and start doing acquisitions and just use that as the umbrella brand and i was like um well a couple things one i didn't have the debt relationships too i didn't know m at that level buying majority of 30 40 million you know 10 on the low side 30 40 on the high side size companies i was like i don't i don't that's those are mistakes that could potentially like undo everything i've done and i'm just not willing to uh to quote a friend of mine i bet the
(15:26) empire for a pot of gold that was kind of the argument against uh just using debt to fuel m a the the final you know keeping argument for for money was like after tax you're almost gonna get the same money as if you just take out debt on the company tax-free and that is true in theory uh but it's unknown based on promises from bankers that's not 100 because a lot of times they may inflate things uh just fyi side note bankers will inflate things for you because they want you to sign on the dotted line to work with them big picture consolidated from this is that
(15:56) like the money wasn't going to change my life in either direction whether i sold her i kept it which brought me to the next one which is energy and have space on one level it's like the story is you can't have more than one thing which i'm a very big proponent of the the counter to that is while riches people own lots of things okay well that's also true too but i think the main difference and i'll i'll hit on this later is that i think you can only have one active thing split split attention is one of the most
(16:21) dangerous things in entrepreneurship and i can tell you that when i did split my attention when i started another company and then a third company my revenue pretty much just continued to flatline so doing more things just does not like you have to focus and i think that you can have multi lots of things that are going on but you can only have one active thing so like if i own a building i'm not active in that i could invest in apple and i'm not active in that and so you can't own lots of things it's just to make sure that what you're owning is
(16:46) not owning you the next point here is that selling is a story it's not reality so it's like the idea that i'm just gonna like walk away magically and not care about the company or the employees or the or the customers it's just that's a story i'm telling myself in my head there's still 100 going to be things that i'm sleeping you know going to bed and thinking about the team and the company all that stuff and so it's like you you're not going to get what you think you're going to get from from selling i was like yeah but i could treat it like other portfolio companies because i'm just it's it's kind of
(17:10) redistributing my net worth you know accordingly across more more enterprises and then i can care about them more evenly whereas here it's disproportionate in terms of like lopsided for my net worth um so i was like okay that's fair another strong argument for keeping is like you'll grow faster never selling just never sell and uh let it compound tax free the counter you know for that is like i just have to outpace that delta what the cash can make me from investing plus what i'm going to make on my own uh versus what that two-thirds
(17:39) share uh would grow into right that's what i have to make up if i can make that up then it would make sense and then this one was actually from my closest friend he said what's the objective what problem are you solving you said i feel like you just chose the nuclear option of like okay you know i i want to get headspace back and so therefore i must uh you know sell sell two-thirds you know sell some majority of my company he said why don't you just match the conditions right like what is what do you imagine life to be like
(18:05) when you have sold majority uh and then look at what those conditions look like and then match them in your current condition and then you can keep the company and still have the effective sale that happens in your mind and i was like that is a fair point but you know my counter is that like i don't think i can do that i feel like i'm still i would imagine it's like having kids where even if you're spending zero time you know taking care of the kids even when they go to college you're still thinking about them right they're still taking up
(18:28) shower time they're still taking walk time they're still taking up morning coffee chat time right and so those are kind of some of the head space considerations i had team resources the big line here is that you know when you sell sell a company you you lose the resources right i'm so used to being on top and having a lot of leverage in my decisions it's way more just deciding at this point like i'm not doing a ton of doing um within any of the portfolio companies and so giving up that kind of all those resources like hey if i'm like hey i want to recruit somebody i just go to the recruiter and say hey can you
(18:58) recruit this person right if i want to like go build a site or i want to go put a book on amazon i just say hey can you go put this book on amazon and then it just gets done right so i would lose that and that might actually be a big asset for what i wanted to do next and actually allow me to move faster right so that is a is a strong argument for keeping it right so these were these are the four thoughts that i had written down during the process was like okay well i could lose the team and uh but like i could
(19:21) coach them to become like the type of people that could work you know at acquisition.com it's like well different needs require a different team that's not a really good shortcut like there's different different skills different backgrounds different experiences etc that's not really good to try and retrofit a team that was not designed for this right you know obviously i love the team they've been with you since the beginning this is me arguing to myself yeah but i need to give them room to grow and if i'm still there kind of on
(19:46) top of it they're not going to be able to like blossom into what i think they can they can really truly grow into you could make your employees wealthier you know if you kept it you could you know do some sort of esop program there which is an employee stock ownership program i was like yeah but they can also become wealthy um through the stock ownership plan that the new you know owners would put in it's like okay that's kind of moot richest guys all said that they regret selling their teams that's something i talk to people who are wealthier than me and they're like they all regretted doing it the counter to that is but they're all really wealthy
(20:11) doing their next thing so you know i get i and i can understand the i can understand both sides of it future and vision uh in terms of like what i want my my my life to be like this could be the cash cow to build the the conglomerate you know that funds all of these new acquisitions that i built into my conglomeration i was like yeah but i could use the cash from the cell to do the same okay fair um the version of me that i want to be can own multiple companies without running them yes um but you still need to give you know like
(20:40) like that's not reality for you right now and then you know finally here you'll still care about uh the team the same and or still care about the company the same uh but you'll just have given up the upside it's like so you're still gonna do the same mental work and mental decisions and strategic planning the way you always are but you'll just give up the upside and the counter to that is like yeah but i'll still have four companies rather than one and that's gonna really distract me from what i want to do ultimately which is acquisition.com and so um that was kind
(21:06) of like the future and vision component of it all right and so uh the last thing before i'll tell you why i made the decision that i did is the business component you know on one side i was like okay do you want to do what is required to get to 200 million i could just do the playbook that the private equity is going to do because i know what their playbook is and so i could just do that so that's an argument right you know businesses always go up in value over time right unless they don't in which case to become sellable so it's like if you keep it and it goes up then
(21:33) like you would still own the thing and it would be making more money in the future so the value goes up and you get dividends the whole time which is why business ownership is very lucrative but in case it doesn't in which case you don't make any money and the thing that you have has no value right um you know they don't have a magic pill they're not going to do anything you don't know how to do it's like yes but they're going to put all their focus on it and i am not because i'm doing other things that i want to do you know
(21:54) imagine what you're going to learn watching them do m a if we sell it um yeah but you don't need to learn you know learn from them to do that so that's a different you know perspective on it um if you want to do uh what they do just buy it from yourself you know and have it have your your new self buy it from your old self still go through the transaction mentally uh install the same incentives run the same playbook as them but just own the whole thing right um but i really thought about that i was like i feel like that's it's fear that's driving that decision fear of losing what i have
(22:25) and it's like hey you need to have the skill uh of being passive well i already have that it's just not i just don't feel like i have that about a company that i founded myself and then um you can always just use the transition plan that i already designed during diligence that i presented to them and just execute it yourself and it's like yeah i can do that in theory but i don't know if it's going to be that clean and so you know the one line summary for for this is like do i think selling or keeping it is the best decision for the business i think that if i keep the company i will increase my net
(22:55) worth more do i think the company will realize its potential if i keep it maybe maybe not i think that the people who were going to potentially buy it had a very good skill set in growing companies of this size they're more experienced than m a than me and so i think that the business would benefit from that all right so what decision did i ultimately make i'll give you my quick one-line summary of kind of selling and keeping after giving you all those different variables for selling anything that distracts from my berkshire hathaway will be a net loss
(23:28) so get into a better boat and this is just the classic example of like everybody told me that i was crazy when i was when i sold my gyms to start the licensing company uh gym launch but this is because like what they saw in front of them was six gyms that were making money and i was 26 or something and they were you know like why would you give something up that you worked so hard for and it's obviously making money and it's because like in some way it's like i have to believe in me more than they do because in their minds maybe
(23:52) that's what they think i'm limited to capacity wise and i think that i can do more uh and so that's the you know the argument for selling the argument for keeping which is also very compelling is you know become the person who can grow a cash compounding conglomerate without ever selling ever you know warren buffett never sells wholly owned companies he also says get into the best boat so he has two pieces of advice that contradict themselves and uh they're both very good and very very fair so what decision did i ultimately make
(24:17) right so everyone has a plan until there's a check in front of them to walk away from 46.2 so um it's one thing to say no in theory it's another thing to say no when you're one email away from that you know money right and so uh these are kind of the soft decision frameworks that i applied so the first one is that i had to acknowledge that there was no wrong answer right so i knew that if i did either of those directions ultimately i was still always going to be very wealthy and none of it was going to make
(24:42) any material difference in my life and whatever decision i tried to go to winners win and i would have probably executed either way and it probably wouldn't matter i knew also from a happiness perspective that i'll probably be happy in either direction and you know rationalize whatever decision i made either way that was like first and foremost none of this matters the second one is like okay well you know is it i could still make a better decision versus a worse decision even though they both might be quote or right decision um which has just reminded me of this the story of the boy and the horse you know father buys a a boy a
(25:15) horse everyone in the town says that's amazing the wise man says time will tell um then the kid falls off the horse and breaks his leg and then everyone's like oh that's terrible you bought the kid the horse and then the wise man says time will tell and then army comes around and recruits all the young guys to go to the military and then you know half them die and then everyone's like oh my god that horse was a blessing and then the watchman says time will tell and so ultimately you kind of get where this is going right is that you don't
(25:37) really know whether something was good or bad until the day you die and once you die it won't matter food for thought noting that the three hardest decisions in my life quitting my job to start my gym selling the gyms to start gym launch and then potentially selling gym launch prestige and allen to start acquisition.
(25:53) com and go all in on that each of those are the three hardest decisions of my life and it's because i had to give up something that i knew that gave me status that people gave me praise for that most people considered big material successes for something that was potentially bigger but completely unknown so some the bird in the hand versus the two in the bush and the thing is is that the hardest decisions i think in life are giving up the one that's in your hand for the two that are in the bush um and so it's like you have to
(26:19) take big risks sometimes to take the next kind of like quantum leap you know take the next uh jump in order of magnitude so these are the three hardest decisions i've ever made in my life and i would say that in order they were most difficult quitting my job second most difficult uh selling my gyms third most difficult uh selling these companies are my majority interest in those companies so i i i give this for context because i think that a lot of people who are listening to this like you're probably in one of these decisions where you have one in your hand and there's two in the bush like i think the hardest decision
(26:48) of entrepreneurship or really life in general is when do you give that up when do you not take the rational move and take take the upside one and so for me i just knew that regret would be more guaranteed from paths not taken rather than failed execution this is a question that i get from layla and it was uh one of the things that we both thought about a lot which is what am i most afraid of like which of these decisions makes me the most afraid keeping it or selling it and for me selling it was the thing i was most afraid of because i was like what if i can't recreate what i've done what if
(27:19) it's you know what it's a flash in the pan what if i'm a one-hit wonder which was silly anyways because we already have seven other businesses we've sold but i'm just telling you these are the thoughts you have right and so yeah like what am i most afraid of that was what i was most afraid of and so finally or second to last i had my 85 year old self test which i have i've talked a lot about and i'll talk more about which is i run and i'm doing this almost like without knowing now because it's been so
(27:42) ingrained because it's been probably the most effective distance framework i've had in my life and so i'm just going to keep using it which is like what does 85 year old me think about this decision and the honest truth is that 85 ruled me in this decision was useless because he was like it's not going to matter anyways uh do the thing that excites you and you know it's like what are you and like i'm talking 85 year old selfies like what are you afraid of and it's like that i'm not going to be successful if i do the next thing it's like well
(28:06) that's not a very good reason not to do it and so i was like okay i guess that's fair does who you want to become you know i was like well i really want to be a rational investor i want to be somebody who makes rational decisions he's like yeah but you know the ups like you're limited on your upside in this and so like if you believe that your life can be bigger than this then you're guaranteed to not get it if you don't take the big jumps i was like okay that's fair and so that was kind of like the main shifts that i got from my 85 year old stuff this was
(28:36) ultimately the one thing that mattered most and then i'll tell you finally why i decided to do what i did the next thing that i do will be 10x or 100 times as big and if anything takes my intent from that it will be a net loss i would hate to look back and think i was holding on too hard to what i had and didn't have enough faith or i could have if i took the leap and believed before sing and so at every level the fog is bigger but so too is the reward and so like as you you know climb the mountain right if you fall there's further to hit
(29:01) the ground um in terms of your perceived failures but like you still have to take jumps to hit the next mountaintops and so i think that was ultimately um the biggest reason for why we decided to do what we did um and i'll tell you one interesting thing which is that like i felt the loss of the business but i didn't feel the gain of the money the money really i didn't feel it at all um and so that was kind of interesting i felt like the loss of resources i did feel some level of relief for about three days and then it was back to normal which was nice and then now that we are
(29:33) back in this in this in this season of building i can tell you 100 that this was 100 the right decision um i you know obviously i'm going to rationalize whatever decision i make but after really thinking through all of the different angles this was the right call because i can already see and feel the momentum it's so nice to be back in the trenches again i love building things um i'm a builder and so it's great to build not only my own business but to build all the portfolio companies and so i'm just i'm learning so much more i'm being exposed to a lot
(30:08) more things which allows me to make more lessons and you know the mission of acquisition.com is to document and share the best practices of building world-class businesses and so you're like why does alex make these videos part of it is because of that like i wish that elon and i wish that that jeff and i wish that you know warren you know wrote books and made youtube channels right of like what they were thinking about at every given you know part of their journey because i hope that 30 40 50 years from now like we were like man if you look at alex in his 30s what he
(30:37) was deciding what he was thinking about and looking in his 40s when he was deciding what he was thinking about i want i wanted these videos to be kind of like proof of that um so that they could hopefully help others retrace the path but i am very very confident that the decision that we made was the right one i just can't tell you the amount of like creative energy it was like the moment we actually made the decision it was like my future unlocked again like i couldn't see past making the decision to sell it was like
(31:00) it was like i had to make this decision before the rest of the opportunities in my life opened up and so um i think i made a tweet that was shared a zillion times which is like the heaviest thing in the world is an iron or gold but it's an unmade decision and so i think um and i made that during the time when i was when i was making this decision to sell or not and so i think that for a lot of us there's these unmade decisions that weigh us down and like they eat up so much of our mental capacity that we
(31:23) just need to free ourselves up and and do it uh and pull the trigger those are the soft decision farmers that i allowed myself to to think through uh a 99 cent book if you want to give 66 cents of that to to amazon uh it's got three thousand five star reviews it's the first of ten books that i'm making kind of detailing the process of of scaling a business i have a course that goes with that that's for free you don't even have to opt in for it so it's not like an email collection it's just i think that the highest leverage thing that most people can do is is improve their offer
(31:51) that's the first place that i start with all the businesses that we take on that we invest in and so if you're curious like what we actually do we we invest in companies that are doing between 1 and ten million in profit uh typically within uh the e-learning or service space so uh you know chains of of brick-and-mortar service businesses that want to license or want to franchise or people who already have a niche uh that they have to find out that they do business services too so it's like oh i'm i'm good at you know bookkeeping i'm good at helping lawyers
(32:18) improve their practices whatever stuff like that are the types of niche licensing businesses that we go after because that's our playbook and so we work with those businesses to scale into you know 30 50 million plus and i make these videos for everyone else to hopefully get there um so that we can have the opportunity to um you know invest in your business and help you help you go to the next level so anyways this is part one uh this was just like the thoughts behind the decision i will do another video or two in terms of what i learned about the negotiation process i'll learn to explain what i learned
(32:47) about the sales process overall uh in other videos this one i wanted to walk through kind of what i was thinking about uh for myself and everyone for why we decided to to do that and then ultimately sell the two-thirds stick hope you found value in this and if you did watch another video and i'll see in the next ones

What Millionaires Know That You Don't - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) how is it that two entrepreneurs can start a business at the exact same time and two years later one of them is 20 times as big as the other one and how can an entrepreneur achieve success make some big risk lose it all and then start over again and then achieve back to the same level of success in a fraction of the time compared to somebody who's starting from scratch that's the question that i want to answer today in this video and if you don't know who i am my name is alex from mozy i own acquisition.com it's a
(00:28) portfolio of companies it's about 85 million a year and the reason i make these videos is because i was once broke and there are a lot of people who are broke and i do not want you to be one of them when you are scaling a company one of the difficult pieces of this because i've tried to think back like why is it that every single time we start another company or require an interest everything goes so much faster even when the strategy itself is not that complex and so think about this structurally most business strategies are not
(00:54) complicated find something that's something find something people want charge a lot of money for it and deliver that thing really well so much so that they tell other people about your product it's not overwhelmingly complex to consider the execution is difficult but the concept is not and so a lot of people think they're going to win on strategy when they're starting a business when you could have two people who have lawn care companies and one person has a long care company worth a billion dollars one person that can barely break five
(01:19) thousand dollars a month it's not because the strategy is significantly different it's just the execution how is it that an entrepreneur or two entrepreneurs can start at the exact same time and one can be get 10 20 30 times faster or when you start over again you can always skip these steps to get to your level of incompetence my theory around this comes down to pattern recognition and let me explain it's not just pattern recognition from the perspective that you have strategies or something that you're you're recognizing
(01:47) but actually patterns in people and so i'm going to give this a quick story to drive this this point home i have struggled for the last decade to find uh an assistant and so it's one of the things i'm actually you know a little embarrassed about but i i've gone over seven on assistance um so much so the point that i was just i almost kind of gave up just even trying to find an assistant and until recently i every time i had an assistant it just always right off the bat it just never felt like right and i always was like yeah
(02:16) maybe it'll get better it'll get better at it and they just never really did and the problem was that i didn't know what it looks like when it's right and so in the videos that i talk about i use the word the term ideal scene i don't know what the ideal scene of this dynamic looks like when we are scaling companies right and i'll tell you what i found out there in a second but like when we're scaling companies what we have to do is pay down ignorance tax of knowing what ideal scene looks like which is where speed comes from having
(02:47) people who have outside eyes look in who already do know what i steal ideal scene looks like so you can skip steps faster and so i'll give you an example what this looks like in real life like for me in the role of executive assistant thank god that like for me it wasn't a necessary thing to continue to grow the businesses now that i have one i don't ever really want to live life without one but the entire time i kept bringing people in i didn't know what to look for we do hiring you know we do the hiring process
(03:13) we do an onboarding and training process they never really got up to speed or we never really got in sync and then i'd slowly kind of fall away there would be distance and then it became kind of awkward and then i would end up having to cut the relationship and so in this instance we immediately synced up i really like the person i trust the person and they are so proactive in all aspects of my life that i just sit down and start working and then she places things in front of me i'm like hey i got 13 minutes she's like cool do this i'm
(03:38) like i've got you know 18 minutes here she's like cool do this and do this and every time i'm done i'm like hey what else should i do she's like boom and so we meet based on the priorities that i have and then she has this big stack and knows how long every every one of these things takes because i talk to her about how long i think the tax will take and then as i have openings we slot it in so it's like i wake up and i'm just crushing work until the end of the day because i know that the amount of time that's been allotted for each of the
(03:59) task is the appropriate amount of time and so and if i do finish early i get another task done right and so we can we can we can crush stuff but it's not so much that this is the importance of the executive assistant more so that it took so long for me to get one and now that i do have one i know that i will not ever not have one for the rest of my life because now i know what ideal scene looks like i know what to look for within the roles that exist in the company there are going to be these gaps as you're growing you know probably on
(04:26) some level that you might need somebody who's going to be a director of marketing you might know on some level that you need somebody who can be a director of sales you might know in some level you need a director of hr director of finance director of customer success director of product you know director of you know all these different things right legal maybe and so these heads of the companies have to come in and so there's two different ideal scenes that you have to know number one is what sequence these people will best fit and
(04:49) you hire because you don't hire them all at once obviously as you're scaling but the second is what does that person look like not just like what does the role do but what is somebody who's very good at this role look like what we're doing is looking at people who are exceptional at the role and saying how can i find something just like this and that is why people can go so much faster because once you have figured out what a sales director looked like who's good or a salesman who's good or marketing director who's good
(05:19) you can find and duplicate that pattern again fundamentally like this is like my belief in terms of speed of scale is that you do not know what the people look like and it's one of the issues that we deal with the most with our portfolio companies so the portfolio companies that we work with are almost all uh e-learning and coaching type businesses um and service-based businesses and we work with those companies and they're like hey you know my mom can do some math and so she's gonna be our uh our controller like i don't i don't
(05:48) think she's what that's not that's not ideal scene that's not what this looks like like just being able to do math is not i mean it's a requisite but it's not all of the requisites for becoming a really good controller and to the same degree it's like hey we've got our top salesman he's gonna become sales director like um i don't know if that's necessarily a good idea he might just be a really high level individual contributor and not a very good sales leader or sales manager the big mistakes that happen and they are so costly
(06:13) because of the time in two ways one it takes time to bring these people on board and then it takes time to figure out that they're not good takes time to off-board them and then the whole while you're not growing because that that whole cycle took the time if you had the right person all of the aspects of that depart would be growing rather than staying the same or shrinking right and you could have just moved on and started as as that department was growing moved on and started filling another role with the right person and then that
(06:39) department started growing instead you have to spend all this time inordinately on this department that you mishired for and then find someone else to replace and you couldn't even hire the next person you need and so when you're thinking about this and this is the big takeaway for everyone is that speed comes from picking the right people and knowing what right looks like and don't get me wrong you're gonna make mistakes we all make mistakes but i can tell you that it's very easy to know when someone is not a stud it's harder to know if
(07:06) someone comes in and starts as a stud and then goes down but i can tell you that every single stud that i've had every single a player i've had i've known they were in a player within the first couple days and so i've had eight players who then stop being a players but if someone is not an a player up front i've never had someone become an a player and so your tolerance or my tolerance for non-excellence continues to decrease in time so that i can not waste the time of trying to figure out whether this person is going to help me
(07:33) grow the business in terms of the thing that is probably getting in your way it's your tolerance is too high for people who are not that good and a misunderstanding of what the roles look like that you need to hire and so the things that you need to do are to decrease your tolerance and find people who already know what this role looks like when it is excellent all right so don't take advice from people who are one step ahead of you right because they might not know i mean how many times have you heard someone say oh
(07:57) i've got this new so and so they're so great and then four months later they're like oh no i actually got rid of that person it didn't work out don't listen to people who are like two steps you know one step ahead or six months ahead like it's not useful find somebody who's built multiple of the types of departments you're looking for scaled it for a long period of time and then that person will be able to share what the what the requisites are for the roles that you're looking for all right so anyways mosey
(08:22) nation lots of love keep rocking and i'll see you guys in the next video keep crushing

Why selfcare makes you poor & fragile [trigger warning] - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bP_rsdO3hWM

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going everyone in this video i'm going to talk about why i think self-care is absolute nonsense and why you should run the other way from anybody who's telling you otherwise and if you don't know who i am my name is alex mosey on acquisition.com got some new swag we run a portfolio of 100 million companies that make all the money and it doesn't matter anyways so purpose of this video like i said all this self-care hoodoo nonsense gets people in a lot of trouble and the reason for that is because we think that
(00:26) for some reason we are doing something wrong when we are not self-caring because it is bad to not self-care because we should we must or else or what and the reason this pisses me off the reason that i made a tweet that went viral um this morning about this is that weekends are new for humans they're not even 100 years old 1929 in england is when the first weekend got passed by a union and it's because people hated what they were doing for their life and so if you want to truly give self-care then stop hating what you do every day novel
(00:58) concept i know stop hanging out with people that [ __ ] suck mind blowing like i said i know and the reason that i am so passionate about this is that i have been told throughout my entire life that i was working too much i was not balancing the things that i was supposed to be balancing and you know what who gives a [ __ ] it's my life i don't need to live by anyone else's rules and neither do you right and so when people say you should be doing this you are not doing xyz just take a pause and be like are these rules that i want to listen to
(01:27) are those your rules that you're trying to apply to my life because there are no rules you can do whatever the hell you want if you want to work for a year straight work for a year straight and the reason you can work for a year straight is because you like what you do the reason these people try and project their own self-hatred for their own lives onto you is because they cannot imagine a world in which someone might actually like what they do every day and didn't don't need an escape a break from what their existence is on a daily basis
(01:53) and so don't feel guilty for just being you and if you don't like your life every day rather than try and figure out and make time for self-care it would probably be better to flip the ratio and start thinking what can i do in my actual life to stop hating it so much that i need an escape from it right and that's different from like yes you need to sleep yes you need to you know rest etc but there's a difference between that and like oh i just need a total spa day and if that's how you relax cool but the thing is is projecting on someone
(02:20) else how they should must need to have to relax or do whatever it's nonsensical it doesn't exist right i wanted to make this video even though it's short because i it just drives me bananas if you want to work work if you wanna take off take off just don't listen to what anyone else says about what you should do for your life you're going to die and so will they and it's not going to matter and in 10 generations don't even remember your name so do you want you're going to die and that is the ultimate freedom and for some reason we live
(02:48) under these chains that we think exist but don't and so i think the process of of growing and really making ourselves free is just simply identifying the things that don't really exist and only existed in our mind to begin with and i think that's why self-create really bugs the [ __ ] out of me or this whole self-care movement it's also soft as [ __ ] like just work right to get it done you need to like give yourself a [ __ ] bubble bath every day because like you're worked so hard like human's been here a very long time we've dealt with
(03:13) much much harder [ __ ] your you know boss having a deadline the next day is not the worst [ __ ] that you've been through and so as a final sign off on this think about the hardest things that you have been through in your life everyone has gone through hard [ __ ] everyone has had difficulties in childhood everyone has had difficulties with siblings with parents blah blah blah these events that shape our lives you have been through harder [ __ ] than this you will survive it will be okay you don't need to
(03:37) self-care you don't need to listen to what anyone else is saying you do you and if that means self-care by all means but just don't protect on anyone else all right lots of love buzzy nation see you guys in the next video bye

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video i'm going to walk you through the true competitive edge that our companies have had in outperforming other companies and if you don't know who i am i'm a business investor i own acquisition.com which is a portfolio of companies that does about 85 million a year all right so my name is alex mozy we recently actually just sold a 66 stake in two of our portfolio companies at a 46.
(00:19) 2 million dollar valuation so i don't sony any courses any masterminds and coaching cards with any mentorships i make these videos because i had a lot of pain coming up in learning these things and i hope that my pain is not in vain and uh i like it because it rhymes too what i want to show you is probably one of the most important questions that you have to answer that will ultimately inform your ability to compete within the marketplace there are kind of two schools of thought around business right you've got the kind of brain brain side
(00:42) there's my brain and then you've got kind of the heart side of business and the hard side is typically ignored because this one is very quantifiable and this one is not but the thing is is that i would make the argument and leyland i would both make the argument that this side even though it may sound touchy feely is actually the more important side and i'll give you a couple of examples before i give you some tactics around this so when you've seen like remember the titans or when you see a new coach come into a football
(01:09) team the actual strategy of the football game hasn't fundamentally changed the rules of the game are the same and typically the strategy of the team doesn't overarchingly change either they just actually do it better and so the doing it better and the higher output from each person a lot of times is not like 20 more a lot of times you can get two times four times eight times more out of the same people because they believe in what they are doing and so the thing is is that they makes that might sound like one of
(01:39) these motivational videos of like you have to watch remember the titans together and then everyone's kumbaya but there's actually the real conversations that have to occur in order to make the business grow and so there's there's lots of core questions that inform the the heart decisions of the company and so i want to focus today on just one of them right and so i'll give you an example of some of them so it's like why do we exist that is a very important question that you have to answer and it has to be answered well how do we behave
(02:07) what are our values is an example of a question that matters a lot who is in charge right during what decisions who does what those are all important questions but the one i want to focus on is the second one that i mentioned which is how do we behave the reason that this is so important is that it's one thing to know where you're going but it's another thing to know how you're going to get there and so this is just as true in business partnerships and marriage in terms of what you want uh to have happen and how you want to get there um as it
(02:34) is in business okay and so what i want to do is actually just walk you through the three values that we have at acquisition.com and why we believe them and so from an overarching perspective the way to come to values um is to look at what are the non-negotiables okay and so what i mean by that is and every company is different because the core thing about values is that they have to be things that are true and innate to you right like for example at southwest uh have fun is one of their core values and if someone does not want to have fun
(03:06) or does not believe in the processes that they do to have a good time then that is a non-negotiable for them that person cannot work at that company it is a fireable offense and so these are not aspirational these are not things that you would like to have these are things that are core to who you are as a person and as a team all right and so when you decide on these non-negotiables they are by their very nature non-negotiable which means that you hire based on these you fire based on these and these are the core spirit of the team and some of
(03:34) the mistakes that i see when people make values is that one they don't draw the line in the sand and so one of the core things about a value is that it has to you have to be able to say this is not this right you have to be able to say okay between justice and mercy we lean towards justice or we lean towards mercy which means you have to repel people with your values all right and so if your values do not repel people then they are not values they are platitudes okay and so it's very important the next thing is that when you're making your
(04:01) values the values themselves need to be ideally said in words that you would normally say so if you have little sayings inside of your community then then a lot of times those can become some of the values you have so for example jim launch one of our first portfolio companies uh speed is king do the boring work these were different ways i mean we could just say work ethic but that's not the way we would have said it we could have say be fast or fast turnaround times but speed is king was the way we would have said it okay
(04:28) and so some of the things that i've learned with this is also you cannot have too many values as in i'll say it differently you can't have too many values you have to be very selective at the the true core values of the company all right and so if you're you know between two a lot of times you just have to chunk up uh and kind of get a broader value but they become the core and i think that what we have found is that three is the sweet spot and that number has continued to distill down over time but i think three
(04:57) is the amount that your human brain can comprehend as lenses to make a decision right and the reason these values are so important is that when you scale the company you have to scale decision making which means you have to scale the frame with which you duplicate the decision making process which is should i hire this person even though alex is not involved in this do they align with the core values and the more strengthened the values the easier it is to have a black and white example of i think this person means two out of the
(05:24) three or one out of three but we only accept three out of three and i will tell you this as an additional point if you have core values in the business i would relay them to all aspects of your life if you would not do business with someone for a decade do not do business with them for a day it's one of the novalisms that i like a lot and so if you wouldn't if you don't want to deal with this client for a decade don't deal with them for a day if you wouldn't deal with this employee for a decade don't deal with them for a day you have to and
(05:49) and the extent to which you hold your line of intolerance around these truly non-negotiables will dictate the health of the organization and if you make these non-negotiables and realize that there are people in your organization in your client base that do not ascribe to these then you must make the changes to fix it and that is the pruning of the tree that will ultimately grow the tree all right these are the short-term pains for the long-term gains all right so what i want to do for the rest of this video is walk you through the three that
(06:17) we have that we look for the entrepreneurs of the companies uh that that own the portfolio companies that we invest in uh that we look for internally in terms of the employees that we hire and grow onto our team so this is both internal and external for us and then finally what we hold ourselves to all right and so these are the three for acquisition.
(06:38) com number one is unimpeachable character and as we were coming up with these over time we had like loyalty was something that was really important to us like absolute integrity was something that was really important to us like long-term minded was something that was really important to us and we were like we had all these words on the board and whatnot it was like what's the what's the what's the through line on this what's the thread that kind of weaves all these things together and for us it was we just want
(07:00) to deal with people who have unimpeachable character if someone has a wisp or an edge that just feels a little bit off these are things that earlier in my career i would i would rationalize and be like but they have all these other things and the the more seasoned i've gotten this the more i just don't negotiate on it it's like if i don't feel like this person is unimpeachable character i want to do business with them it's because if i wouldn't do it and a great frame of this is like would i do this with this person for a decade
(07:22) no then i don't want to do business with them for a day and so here's three frames that you can look at that i like a lot right and this is uh this is a little story that i got from a friend of mine who was talking to somebody who's on seal team six and they were explaining the difference between people who were seals versus people who were on steel team sex right he said listen at this level every single naval sea navy seal would lay down their life for another guy he's like that's kind of the ticket of entry to just be a seal right
(07:47) he's like but the people who are on team six he's like we have other things that we have to look at right you know if someone has an ego they're going to become he's like the hard problem somebody who's who has an ego but is a really high performer because they become cancers on the team right and a lot of us have these people or have had these people in our companies and i can tell you they are such a cancer like you don't know the damage they are doing to your culture which is ultimately affecting the overall company
(08:08) performance all right but the first the first through line here for us and the easiest one is like if we see someone who has an ego then then then we already know that they're not going to be they're not going to be receptive to feedback they're going to point fingers they're going to always think their idea is best uh and they're going to think they're better and ultimately we just don't want to do it that type of person right but here's two two questions that they asked uh in team sex that i really liked a lot he says not only can i trust
(08:31) this person with my life he said can i trust this person with my wife can i go and leave and leave my wife with this guy for a month and expect nothing to happen can i expect no passing comments can i expect no no moves no flirts no no no str stray looks because they have unimpeachable character the the second one was can i trust this person with my money if i were to give this person way more money than they have ever had and say i'm gonna leave i need you to hold on to this i don't know when i'm gonna be back but i will be back for it can i
(09:02) wait a month can i wait a year can i wait a decade and expect for that money to be sitting in the same corner that i left it and these are just questions that i ask when i'm looking at someone and thinking like does this person have unimpeachable character under what conditions do i think i could put what hot water could i put this tea bag in and see what's on the inside come out when you're asking questions and and for us when we're asking questions on interviews for uh candidates for the company but also when we're asking
(09:30) questions to the entrepreneurs what we're looking for is not even their answer but how they answer them to give us insight into their character and so for us unimpeachable character is the absolute foundation upon which everything we have is built the second one is sincere candor and the reason that this is so important is that we believe that you cannot make progress without feedback and if you can't give feedback then you cannot identify the deficits that exist in order to improve them and so for us having sincere candor
(09:56) is two aspects one of them is having the self-awareness to accurately identify situation and deliver the feedback that is good but also to be on the other side of this and have the humility to receive feedback not take it personally and to improve as a result right and so we look at this on the portfolio company side the entrepreneurs that we invest in and then also on the team side of the candidates that we choose to bring in do we think that this person can take feedback do you think this person has the intellectual wherewithal the
(10:23) emotional awareness to to give feedback in a way that is that is useful and constructive those are the types of things that really matter in an organization because when you have these unspoken things and these these these these wounds or these resentments what happens is this space starts to fill up between people and then their communication becomes less effective and fundamentally like running a company is based on how well you can communicate it's clarity of communication and so that is why this is so important for us
(10:51) as an investment company and also um in terms of the companies that we look looking to to help grow and so the third piece here is competitive greatness and i think and we borrowed this from john wooden because layla and i are both huge fans of his which is are you at your best when your best is needed the enjoyment of a hard challenge that is how he defines it but if you're thinking about this and this is how the value should stack up when you're looking at your own values which is how do we behave with this account
(11:17) within your company the three values should give you a vibe for the company overall like if you read these three things you should think to yourself okay people with unimpeachable character who have sincere candor and competitive greatness this should give you a vibe of the type of place that this might be if you're if i were to list off do the boring work speed is king have humility now there might be some similarities there between these ones and and uh and our gym launched one though don't sugarcoat it right which is kind of a different
(11:46) version of sincere kinder different flavor same concept right is that you should be able to read those values and say like i think i get the vibe for this place and you should also be able to say i don't think this person will fit in and so imagine you're interviewing someone and you're like okay i think this person can both give and receive feedback okay and they can do that effectively you know like i think they're very solid people i think they have undefeatable character when i think about the different um different things
(12:09) and stressors i would expose them to i think that they would hold strong but it's like oh i don't know if they're like really driving i don't know if they're ambitious i don't know if they really want to like take the hill and do big [ __ ] right well then but they have two out of the three i think they could still maybe fit for the it's like no if these are non-negotiables then they are non-negotiables and you have to continue to massage these until you get exactly the true core that gives you that triangle the three lenses to look
(12:36) through if you have 10 values it's impossible to make a decision it's it's it's also almost impossible to think through candidates there's too many lenses and so that is why we found three to be the sweet spot for us and so and look at a different one let's say you've got somebody who's competitively great super ambitious super hard charging right can accept and give feedback but you don't think they're characters there like you think if if things got hard they would revert to something different then that's somebody that you don't want
(13:00) on the team because things are going to be hard in the future that's a virtual guarantee that within business things will get hard and so you're just predicting what's going to happen in the future and just avoiding the landmine and so what i've also learned is a tangible side note is that a lot of times success in business is just making fewer mistakes is trying to avoid the dumb decisions trying to avoid the people that are going to become cancers in your company more than it's making very smart moves a lot of times uh the
(13:23) level of activity continues to decrease as we've weathered and scaled our our portfolio but i think the the skill with which we execute the things has improved because we were just more deliberate and we try we still make plenty of mistakes but we try to make fewer of the dumb ones over time this video is for making the values within your business what are the things that you stand for what are the non-negotiables with the company what are the things that you want all of your clients to adhere to what are the
(13:48) things that you want all of your team to adhere to and what are the lenses that we can use to truly draw a line in the sand and say this person does not fit in and if most people don't fit to the non-negotiables that you have good most people shouldn't be in your company all right so lots of love mosey nation if you're new welcome i make these videos because i went through a lot of pain and suffering to try and figure this stuff out and i hope that that pain is not in vain lots of people are broke don't want you to be one of them enjoy

Top 10 Fast Business Lessons From My Last 10 Years - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WsYgWC7NmO8

Transcript:
(00:00) our portfolio of companies does 75 000 per working hour 40 hours per week and building this has taken a long time and so what i share with you in this video is 10 lessons that i have learned in observing all of those companies over the last you know 10 years let's start with the first one and if you don't know i am my name's auction mosey i own acquisition.
(00:20) com it's portfolio of companies does all that stuff all right so the first one is uh something that actually learned from the private equity managing partner who acquired two of the companies uh last year number one is that most things don't matter and a few things matter a lot and you can achieve outsized returns by only focusing on those few and so once you figure out those few things you can ruthlessly eliminate the rest and the thing is is that this is very hard because a lot of us get really excited we go to workshops we go to seminars we
(00:45) see ads on facebook and we think oh you know i should be doing this new sexy thing and the reality is that there are very few things that can give you 10x 50x results and so if you just focus on those few things you can get a lot of other stuff wrong and i think all of us could use more second chances and more padding right and so if you can just focus on those big things you can make those mistakes and still succeed and so when the private equity partner who kind of taught me this lesson is when i was observing some of the things that he's
(01:08) doing with jim launch prestige labs during the last quarterly uh meeting you know our team was going through all the things that uh that they were doing to kind of you know improve the company and grow and i could tell that he was only interested in only two conversations that occurred number one is that you know we were building in some technology into the business because that would yield a much bigger multiple for the business in the future the second was accretive which means basically value additive m a so looking at companies
(01:32) that are similar in the space that they could roll in to the overall conglomerate because in his mind he knew that the only way to you know sell that you know those two particular companies for over you know 250 million or more which is the the goal would probably come from those two main things and the rest of it for the most part he just considered blocking and tackling which was just yeah of course you know we'll grow we'll do these things but the big nuts the big levers uh for getting that growth was going to come from very few
(01:57) things and that is where he allocated all of his attention and to me that was a very important lesson to witness that was number one number two is that the size of your slice of the pie matters more than the shape all right so a lot of people's egos mine included right 100 of the pie which is a perfect circle right we want 100 of the pie but our bank accounts only care about how much that slice of pie weighs right if you are one percent owner on facebook you'll be significantly wealthier than owning 100 of probably the small business that
(02:21) you have right and so the thing is is that in order to do that it means you have to give a place to the pie because it takes more people to build big things right and so getting other people tied and compensated for the achievement of your vision is one of the key things that is required and i noticed that because as soon as we've uh done profit sharing plans and given you know bonus pools and things like that to tie leaders into the success and the achievement of the overall vision we got significantly outsized returns in excess
(02:47) of what we had given up and so it's just the the weight of the slice that we have or that we keep is now worth more than if we had had 100 and not had that incremental growth through enlisting the spirit and willpower and drive of other people right and one of the interesting things that i've witnessed is that if you look at the richest people in the world the vast majority of them do not own 100 of their company i mean the vast majority don't even own the majority of their company look at basis only it's 10
(03:10) of amazon at this point elon owns 20 and 17 percent of spacex and tesla right and so there's you know if we take lessons from these people it's that the more people you make wealthy the more wealthy you will become right and it's true from a business to consumer standpoint if you sell kind of b2b but also just from the overall infrastructure of the of the marketplace like the more people you have who are rooting for you because they are vested in your success the more you will ultimately make and this is difficult for our egos and this took me
(03:34) way way too long to realize number three is that big things take time all right um i knew that when i was you know younger in the entrepreneurial game i was very obsessed with fast wins fast wins fast ones what can we do this week what can we do this month rather than thinking 10 years out 20 years out and the thing is is that when i and i learned this lesson from andrew chung who owns panda express and he lives in the building above me he actually owns this entire building uh which he bought for i think like 150 million and he owns
(03:57) the building next to us which he bought for 5.6 billion big dude and he owns 2 600 locations of panda express and he owns them all 100 he has no franchisees no licensors and when asked on an interview what the keys to success were there were two themes that that came out one he said your customer must absolutely love your product and number two is that big things take time right it took him 45 years and he still continues to grow this day and the majority of the growth has happened in the last you know five years or so this
(04:20) year he opened up 600 locations of those two of those 2 600. so a huge chunk happens near the end and that depth of expertise takes time to build because remember we're competing against other people who've also been doing this for a long period of time and the one thing that we can take to our advantage is if we've just been doing this longer right and we get these compounding results that happen over a long period of time and so i think rather than making this a patient's platitude thinking of this as what could i do for a very very long
(04:45) period of time because the only things that will be very big will take a long time and i must be motivated to not change my course or see some shiny object that's going to take me away from my overarching vision or goal and so i think when i started thinking this way the companies that i had continued to grow better with higher quality people and made higher quality decisions because it wasn't about the short win it was just is this gonna matter in 10 years and what are the few things that will matter in that long period of time
(05:09) and then let's ruthlessly limit everything else and just focus on those things number four brand matters a lot all right and so this is something that took me again a very long time to understand and the way that you build brand is that you make promises and you keep promises not only to the level that you made the promise but in excess of that so you make a promise and then you deliver above that promise brand is simply the reputation that you have in the marketplace is what people say behind your back right and what most
(05:32) people don't have is the invisible hand behind the scenes that's pushing higher and higher return on advertising because more and more people have heard of you from a friend before seeing your ads or your reach outs or whatever it is that you use to get customers right and so what happens is that most people do the opposite of that they make big promises they under fulfill and then over time their cost of acquisition raises beyond the increase in cost per impression or cost of time on their labor because they
(05:55) have an invisible hand that's suppressing their growth which is negative word of mouth which is much stronger and much more viral than positive word of mouth and so people don't understand they think they blame the platforms they blame you know pixel changes and things like that when the reality is that they have negative word of mouth that's working against them and they just don't know how big of a deal it is right and so the beauty of brand if you build it the right way is that it gives you this is the tactical behind
(06:16) brand is that branding gives you premium pricing power all right if you look at a cup of coffee that's plain a cup of coffee at starbucks they can charge you know four or five times the price if you look at a white t-shirt that's plain and you look a white t-shirt that has a nike logo on it they can charge 10 times more you put a gucci logo on it you can charge 100 times more right and so what the brand does is give you pricing power and that pricing power translates directly to bottom line profits right and so when you have that branding power
(06:40) you can have outsized profits compared to the marketplace and give yourself a competitive moat that over time if things if cost of goods increase or supply chain gets broken down the people who are trading in commodities and do not have a brand behind them will go out of business whereas you will have the padding of your profit margin to continue to weather the storm and endure for the long haul number five simple scales fancy fails all right when i look at the companies that we have that are the biggest in the portfolio they have
(07:02) the simplest business models because scale creates complexity all on its own you don't need to add complexity we don't need to help complexity exist it already exists at scale and so we have to make the fundamental units as simple as humanly possible we have to make our offer suite as simple as humanly possible we have to make the customer journey as simple as humanly possible and who we serve as simple as humanly possible so we can streamline our messaging streamline the customer experience streamline the products we
(07:26) streamline the pricing so that the customers understand what we're doing the sales team understands what we're doing the customer service team and success team understands what we're doing and so all we're doing is adding more to that machine rather than adding uh complexity and adding new doodads and i love this quote because i think it's a really good one which is do not risk the empire for a pot of gold which i heard from my good friend uh charon cervaza who sold his company for a zillion dollars all right um and i just really
(07:51) really like that so simple scans fancy fails and a lot of times we need to ignore the shiny objects that are sent here to test how good we are as entrepreneurs and how dedicated we are to keeping things simple because if you cannot keep it simple a lot of times it means you do not understand it which means you may not even understand your own business number six emotions are the enemy when i look at the portfolio founders who are the most successful they are the least emotionally reactive they are the most rational in their
(08:13) decision making they are the most long-term minded and so one of the one of the the truisms that i've adopted is nothing is ever as good or as bad as we expect except for the things that we don't expect all right and so i'll unpack that so from a tactical perspective when we make these projections we think there's this new thing that we want to add a lot of times it's not going to be as good as we think it is right it's usually going to be less than that and to the same degree the equal opposite side of the coin is
(08:34) if there's some threat that comes in most times it's not as bad as we think it is or it's going to be so we catastrophize uh negatively worse than it really is and we and we project that something's gonna be much better than it is and most times it's in the middle it's less than our imagination could anticipate except for the things that we never expected which is why the al size returns often come from things that we didn't expect at all right and so most times we need to be much more conservative in our estimates on either
(08:58) direction so that we do not become emotionally reactive and swayed by the greed or excitement of the upside or the depression and fear of the downside and i can tell you the amount of times that i thought i was going to lose the different companies that i've owned over time is a lot and the amount of times that we have lost them is zero up to this point you know in the last 10 years and so a lot of times we think things are much worse than they are and we make bad decisions because we think we're up against a wall we think that things are
(09:24) going to die and so that's not true that's your mind fooling you and i think one of the disciplines from the character traits that has to be honed over time is a decrease in emotional reactivity number seven level 10 talent is only attracted to level 10 opportunities i learned this from steven schwartzman who wrote what it takes he's the founder of blackstone now he's worth i think 30 billion and his and blackstone i think manages almost 700 billion dollars so a lot of money and he said this very well so i'm not going to
(09:49) try and pair it as as though it's my own he says you need level 10 talent to build anything big right and so we have to think long and hard about how big this can be so that others people's dreams can fit inside of it and so like if you want to build a dry cleaning a local dry cleaning business there's nothing wrong with that it's just that level 10 talent is not going to probably be attracted to that opportunity and so we have to think long and hard now if you think my true goal you're not just saying this but it has to be true to you
(10:11) is that i want to build a different way for people to clean their clothes in a convenient way because that's something that you are driven to do and you think you can do it for a very long period of time and you don't think you'll get distracted by other things that are shiny objects etc you will be able to build it to a size where other people start to believe you and then you will be able to enlist level 10 talent and i also learned this one from sharon because i like this quote a lot he said your best talent isn't even on your team
(10:32) yet the best talent exists in the future and so we have to make room for those people which goes back to the slice of pie and things that i was talking about earlier all right number eight in terms of lessons that i've learned in building our portfolio compounding in business creates breathtaking results when you add the one ingredient that people hate the most time everyone hates to add time because everyone is impatient and if you look at the people who i think in my opinion i look up to or the most successful they have one thing under
(10:52) control which is their impulses they can control their impulses because they see that adding time is the single greatest variable to achieving the outsized returns that you were looking for and so one of the things that i've noticed of the portfolio companies that we have the biggest companies our portfolio obsess over the 101 improvements versus trying to double in 90 days they can extrapolate the fact that a 10 per quarter growth rate means a 40x growth rate over a decade and they can actually think in decades because you know what
(11:17) right now if you're doing a million bucks a year if 10 years make you do 40 million a year would you be okay with that you don't need to swing for the fences every time if you just hit singles and you do that consistently set goals that are far more achievable will be that people will actually believe they can do and c gives you room to overachieve those things and i think that the goals that i have set for the portfolio companies and my own companies has consistently got more and more conservative now some people set goals
(11:39) that are completely silly right and you know they're they're useless in that they're so achievable that they're not worth anything and so that's not who i'm talking to and i would say the vast majority of entrepreneurs i talk with that is not their problem they're usually setting goals that are way too unrealistic and that goes back to the expectations of thinking that things are going to be better than they really are right and so we have to set goals that in my opinion if we were just to do these things and that were the
(11:59) assumption if we just did 10 or quarter how much bigger would it be at the end of the year if we did just 10 a quarter for the next two years how much bigger would we be right and obviously give ourselves rooms to overachieve those things but if we just did those things what would it look like and a lot of times it would look really really juicy but most people are unwilling to take that short term goal and say i'm just going to hit the 10 we're just gonna we're going to make sure that beyond any shadow of doubt we can hit that right
(12:21) because that is where the breathtaking results occur is that those one percent five percent 10 improvements that happen over the very long period of time and that is what creates the magic and compounding right a lot of people talk about compounding from an investment perspective but if you are in your own business shifting your hat a little bit more to the investor hat even though all of your net worth or probably the majority of your net worth is in your company if you can think about it like an investor you will start to getting
(12:41) the investor-like returns which is probably what you want rather than the erratic unreliable you know it would do or die type of mentality that happens especially in the earlier stages of a business but as you mature in the business itself and the business matures the thinking must change number nine any number no matter how big multiplied by zero is still zero all right and so risks are to be respected right the biggest companies take actions that have very little downside all right and so most times um or i'll say this
(13:07) you would only take a company-sized risk where you put your company on the line when not doing so risks the company more all right and so that's the big thing is i see people people who want to be portfolio companies so companies doing you know three million five million et cetera who right when we hop on the phone with them like hey i want to do this big thing and i'm like you know that's extremely risky for for the business at the size right now they're like yeah but we have to do it and i always kind of think do we though like
(13:29) do we really because the answer is probably no and it's usually emotions that are causing a distortion in reality for the founder and so you only take a company size risk when you really know that if you do not do if inaction right or continuing to do what you were doing um will create a failure now we've heard the case studies of kodak you know you know losing their business and you know blockbuster losing their business but there are far far far far more times where business was perfectly fine and the founder basically destroyed it
(13:55) because of their own irrational fears or excitement or exuberance over a new opportunity that was not core to the business and then put the business on the line and lost and so you do not take company size risks unless the company is truly on the line and you have very strong evidence to support that which is in the vast majority minority of circumstances and most times if you were solving a problem that most people suffer from because you already have product market fit because people already buying the thing people are
(14:19) always going to want to make more money people are always going to want to improve skills people are always going to want uh to lose weight people are always going to want to have better relationships people are always going to want there are a lot of things that those demands those desires will not disappear and the reason that we invest in businesses that are non-tech related for the most part is because we know that we can consistently i would say 80 portfolio is not tech based right so the vast majority of businesses we know that
(14:40) if we can do the boring work we can repeat successful actions once we find product market fit where people want this thing solved and we can solve it well most of the growth comes from not putting the company on the line but doing the things that no one wants to do which is simply improving simply getting better at fulfilling the promise and i'll give you a quick story on this dragon dictation way long ago there was a dictating software this is probably like 20 years ago that came out very early days in computing because a lot of
(15:03) people weren't even good at typing this so they created dragon dictation they created a 2.0 version of direct dictation that had zero new features zero all it did was be more accurate at dictation when people would speak they would get more uh accurate results on the screen and they were praised by so many people for making this move but the thing is is that most of us don't want to do that hard work of making the thing that we actually sell better improving the experience decreasing the the time to experience result decreasing the time
(15:32) to value improving the customer health score segmenting customers by their needs and and trying to match those better with the products we have a lot of people don't want to do that work because it feels boring feels heavy it's not sexy it's not exciting but that is where you drive the outsize value that is where you build the brand that gives you the premium pricing power that is where you build the word of mouth that ultimately creates the competitive moat that you can stand on as a company for years not days number 10 sell what the customer
(15:59) wants not what you want to build all right and this was a big one all right because our egos want to matter but the thing is is that we don't matter we want to be right but what matters more is what the data says and so we have to lead with data rather than ego and i mean there was a company um that we have in our portfolio that really wanted to do this uh at a new ascension a new product line that was going to be uh an upsell and a very high ticket thing um in their business and i felt strongly that it was not what the the clients
(16:24) wanted they're like dude but we're so good at this this we could provide so much value et cetera and i said well let's just let's just survey right and let's survey this is what i think we should we should offer which was more of what people were already buying just an increased version of the thing or this new thing right that's really exciting for you guys and so we did the survey and guess what came back 85 percent of the people who were customers just wanted more of the thing that they already had 15 percent wanted the new
(16:50) shiny thing and so the thing is is that these types of huge pivotal decisions in a business can completely off-road you and destroy your business by simply not taking the step to listen to your customer because a lot of times our egos don't want to listen to that we want to be right we want to do the thing that sounds exciting to us but that a lot of times isn't what the business requires and so what the business requires is a founder or ceo who's customer centric who's customer focused who's not focused on building what they think is exciting
(17:14) but building exactly what the customer wants even if it's boring to them and hell if it's born to you awesome means you're already probably pretty good at it right and that is where the depth of expertise gets built and compounded over time number 11. this is my the simplest way of putting business success into a series of statements all right so the recipes for success in my opinion can be boiled down to this make promises keep promises build brand use brand to increase pricing power above the market use extra profits that were supported by
(17:41) the brand to spur growth through hiring better people and adding new acquisition channels give slices of the pie to get a bigger slice overall and enlist more people in your vision and then give time time and that is it so if you don't know how my name is alex mosey like i said i'm managing partner at acquisition.
(17:55) com uh we take three million dollar companies to 30 million dollars plus and beyond that is what we do every day you can find out more at acquisition.com and uh if you dug this leave some questions in the in the comments i've been trying to answer the comments um more than i have in the past i've been trying to allocate some time am i scheduled to do that love you guys mosey nation you guys are amazing i don't deserve you i appreciate you nonetheless and if you're new to the channel welcome and i'll see you guys on the other side

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YUXLJauT4eY

Transcript:
(00:00) all right we are here Black Friday I have a special edition today with uh the man the myth the legend Harley who is president of shopy we're going to go over five to seven stores that are absolutely crushing it now here's the advantage that Harley has and that we can share that no one else can he knows what's going on in every single store across the world in Shopify so he knows who's killing it by how much and what they're doing and then we're going to highlight some of the things that they're doing specifically well so that
(00:29) you can either buying us to your you know Shopify if you're if you have a Shopify store or just how you how you sell whatever it is that you sell we're we're effectively turning on the camera for conversations and you I usually have private right like over text or F calls or whatever I'm like hey check this out this is really cool and so now we're just going to kind of like open up the Kona for it before we do that we you check this out yeah let's go so we so Black Friday sat Monday weekend uh is sort of Super Bowl we have millions of
(00:53) sources on Shopify and so what we want to do is is project in real time literally like minute to a minute how things are going and uh we I think we hit Peak a little earlier today brand new EST on Friday but we're now at a 3.4 75 million doll in sales every single minute minute every single minute 28,000 orders per minute and almost 30,000 unique Shoppers what is amazing though okay so we're about to North America is about to come here can I stand up yeah so what you're about to see is this North America right here so you see
(01:24) where the orders originating from where it's going to but there you may also there these little fireworks oh okay so those fireworks every one of those fireworks is a brand new entrepreneur getting their very first sale that is a brand new entrepreneur being created the common threat of what we're going to we're going to talk about today is that they're doing things that I think are unobvious incredibly effective well let's kick this off with gym shark I was just texting null before this like hey is there anything uh that n is is is the
(01:53) best I think with gym shark because obviously we're going to look at the site we're about to break all like the little details down but there's also the things that they do prior to getting into the site right which is what is the brand what is the brand context that this sits within and so I think Jim shark does such a good job of building the brand and giving and providing value and making positive associations with the right people the right athletes at the right time um that when they give when they need to give and they did like Reps for mental health like they give when they need to give but when it's time to ask they ask if they mean it and
(02:22) so Black Friday is the best time to ask and so let's dive into it they also know Their audience really really well so remember there's a couple things let's start high level and we'll go into actual Tac High Jim shark is the quintessential online retailer started online Ben Francis starts this he's literally a pizza delivery guy in 2012 starts jym shark and they build this amazing online business it's an online brand phenomenally but actually right now one of the most interesting things about them is they have a massive physical store popup in New York city so they are
(02:53) not necessarily staying within the confines of one particular Channel they're expanding well beyond that as well this offline presence is going well now now they will still do the majority of their sales I suspect they haven't told me this I suspect will be online it doesn't matter this idea of having a 12we popup for the holidays is amazing that's one second is it's a 12we holiday popup right it's not four days it's 12 weeks and so the fact that they're doing a three-month popup about holidays means
(03:19) not only are they starting before their comp competition they're also ending after their competition yeah right so they're expanding that that's something that's really cool they did this really cool social media Campaign which was sort of like quote there will be signs and no one knew what their will be signs meant well what it meant was in all their advertising there would actually be Easter XG these little of what they were doing now it wasn't obvious it was super unobvious but because Jim shark is so creative and their community and fans are so creative their fans kind of
(03:48) understood something there so people started going doing a deep dive into every marketing campaign every new product so they actually convinced people to spend more time on the site to look at look at what is actually doing It's Kind like the super when people are like oh I just want to watch the ads it's like they're actually they're getting their whole audience the most engaged audience to pay attention to it but not only that but also make content about their marketing that's exactly right which then gives them this whole
(04:11) extra you know lift to uh their their Impressions and so I I thought that was really really cool so a couple things so I'm just put that what is is Easter eggs a lot of Easter eggs they did really really well all right cool so let's start with the uh let's start with the site so what's the what's the if if we're talking pure conv look like look at like this site is a effectively a giant coupon yeah now one of the little this is me getting s ttic so if we look here there's a couple things that I I want to point out
(04:39) to to to my folks which is number one is they talk about lowest prices on top sellers which is nice because number one it's like okay we're not just doing it on the crap we're doing it on the good stuff all right so it's point one number two is now this is a little bit of um again this is just tactics notice that it's with the code and so I know this sounds like a small thing but sometimes basically getting people to I think you maintain the retail value from a brand perception perspective and then only at
(05:05) the checkout people then realize the savings and I think it I think it feels different as as it's closer to the purchase now that I don't have a a double blind Placebo split test to back it up that's just me as a well actually what I would suggest though is that in this particular case they're being incredi like they're giving it to you in a silver platter they're saying effectively go by right now now traditionally if you look at this site in 3 weeks from now it's very slick oh yeah black incredible imagery great product photography this is different I
(05:33) don't know what like this is a completely different thing that you've never seen before I also want to point something out also look at the order on top there's only three things in the top header yeah women's sale men's sale accessory sale they don't have any of their other product categories this is deliberately designed for this particular week so if we're thinking about when you're when you're making offers for whatever it is that you're selling it's it's it's narrowing focuses right or F fol folks ey right so we've seen that yeah F the um so they did this experiment
(06:04) there's 24 jars of gem and then six jars of gem at the Super Market and they had people try them out and the 24 jars of gy had more people try them but less people buy and then the six got way more buyers like two or three times more buyers and so the same thing happens is that we have to focus as entrepreneurs and say okay I'm going to have a disproportion amount of attention my customers are going to have their wallets out at this moment what am I going to prioritize yeah yeah and it's a parox of choice yeah give people too much choice and they're going to get lost so this I think is very very effective because they are they are
(06:34) giving you breadcrumbs leading you exactly to where they want you to go I'm say focused product Suite is another one and I'll add in the uh the conversion conversion coupon uh emphasis all right so there is one other thing that before we move on from them that I I thought was interesting so I was curious about why would they do a longer popup and one of the things that I think they did didn't tell me this but I is at the early stage of their popup again this was a holiday popup that was three months in in in in
(07:04) duration is I believe they figured out very quickly what was going to be the hottest items for the action season so they pretested again this is only my hypothesis they're very smart I think the fact that they were able to get in in in October 1st they knew what was going to sell at the end of November no one else was able to do that I think that type of I don't know like like crystal ball yeah I think I like I think that is very effective and I'm certain that's in some marketing meeting or some meeting at that company or even in other
(07:34) companies they said why would gy to a three- Monon popup for the holidays and I think they were thinking themselves we're g to get so much data soer so what's your later this is such a so all businesses I like this big generalization but like data is so powerful when it comes to weaponizing resources right and so for us for example like I'll just completely different perspective but like the content that we know performs the best tends to be when we look at past content that has done well and then we combine
(08:02) just winners and so it's like we create you know 450 pie of content a week but we only make one or two Longs and the Longs do really well but it's because we have 438 shots on goal that we say okay we're just going to take the top 20 of the you don't have to make any assumptions right you can see right away we know this before that's exactly right awesome those are some of the things I think for Jim shark that that work really well all right rock and roll let's let's move on to uh let's actually let's go to let's go to let's go to the let's go to bark Buck you have it up here let's rock it okay okay box okay
(08:30) Bark Box if you have a pet you likely know you want to move this I'm going to this guy we'll recap at go all right Bark Box this is like a you know an Alex size posted note this how I good um okay so BarkBox if you don't know it is this incredible Pet Food business pet company um and one of the things that I think they do really really well is that they have a deep understanding of their customer not just disimilar from gym shark but one of the things they did was they actually created challenges to get discounts so
(09:04) rather than simply give up the discount they created these pet quizzes they've been doing this for a couple weeks now but it also it created this interactive gameification it wasn't simply here's a coupon go buy it and they have competition I mean there's a lot of shoes that there's a lot of other companies out there but I think one of the reason that bbx is winning is because it doesn't feel like a simp a simple transaction it feels like you're actually doing something a lot different it's like customer it's like and you're also challenging people to say like if you do this and you do it
(09:34) well you get this reward right it's almost pav yeah and and I think um so I just I think they did it really well I also think thing they did is they created um a very personalized experience because one of the things they got from the quiz they got a lot of great information about the customer notice common theme on the data here side not yes oh yeah exactly I mean all these people are yeah they're retailers I guess primarily but they're incredibly smart um business innovators they look at data there they're they're scientific
(10:05) about how they run these promotions and so here's a great idea because they did this challenge based coupon so you got this gamification piece of it but you also they were able to ingest a ton of data from their customers so now you know like I I didn't take the quiz but I assume one of the quiz questions was name of your pet um tell me about the age of your pet now you actually have a wonderful datab they know they're remarketing what they're going to be precisely now you have this wonderful database breed right sure um but I think
(10:32) this idea that like the best entrepreneurs play into the brand the strength of their brand they're not trying to be at some point we're going to talk about butcher box not be box you make that mistake it may be awkward um but they're not trying to be like a high-end Meat Company they're just trying to be who they are and I think they have a really good understanding of that um so lowkey personalized experience that was delivered through this gamification I think they did really well and Mar box is been phenomenal and I'll talk about uh one
(11:01) one really big one so on jym shark I didn't mention it but it was there they had a top banner and so one of the one of the best and most valuable pieces of real estate on on any online story is going to be the top banner I think when I was scrolling this guy there it is yep so you can see they have their top banner and they're they're making like that is especially on mobile which you probably know the percentage of traffic but a huge percentage of traffic more than right now across the internet more for online retail more than half the
(11:28) traffic is on mobile historically the actual check out was lower that's changed with things like shot pay ah like shopay I'm not not this isn't a shop pitch it's true because even though you may browse on a mobile device you didn't want to have to put in your credit card number on a mobile device annoying but now it's we're to Checker whether it's chop or or appay makes much easier so conversions have gone dramatically up on a mobile device because of acceler J which is great because that's where a lot of
(11:52) impressions are served precisely so uh BarkBox also has this but I want to double click into not actually double click but like let's zoom into uh the they wanted to make it easy for firsttime buyers and so they're going you know obviously they have all this marketing theyve all these people are sharing stuff and get your first box for $7 right so they know obviously they're going to they're going to do things for their repeat customers they're going to take care of their existing audience but you have this opportunity where you have a disproportionate amount of eyeballs with new customers and so if you can double down and make a crazy offer
(12:22) because you know what your LTV is on that customer it's a great time to do it now when paired with and this is again we're going to mix and match here but with gy shar's iners emphasis it's like you can get this deep relationship now they're approximating that by getting tons of information on them but in the IRL setting so in real life you also get the this test for in a clothing store right and they're like wow and it it becomes a totally different shopping experience it becomes an identity shift
(12:47) you say you know I'm a gym shark fan I'm a gym shark athlete whatever and look products that are on there they are their top I don't know I I can't really see if there's light there I those are top four selling products likely right they're just making it all the here's what we sell do you want these things you can buy them right now we have so first-time buyer incentives uh and they did the same thing as as uh Jim shark which is prioritize the buy box right they know what people want and they're making sure that it's clear and evident uh and it's look it's timely what look
(13:19) what the banner says bark Friday that web this page is created for today it is Black Friday it is not it is not like the weekend or holiday special this is a deal for right now in hyper real time and if you don't get it by midnight yep you know as I say in French safey need yeah safing makes so but yeah so Banner urgency and firsttime offer prioritizing the best products using data to it to create deeper relationships for remarketing the future people are going to have lower action thresholds uh now so they're
(13:53) going to it's easier to get people to take that first step and give you a little bit more information we' did something like that this morning as well which is like okay we're going to make this big for acquisition.
(14:04) comom uh we have our scaling road map that came out but people had to fill out all this information for their business now obviously that's going to help tailor the thing that we're going to give them but it also helps you it's going to be useful for meix and actually that's a great quit proo cow because most people don't want to give information for free but if I can give you information and return for that information you're going to give me a discount you're going to give me money back person that's right and also bottom left corner of the screen this is what they want they want you to Bas up for their subscription yeah right so they like it like yes you
(14:28) can buy things alak cart are up there as well but it's ultimately they want a multi-on subscription from you and they're giving you an incentive to do it on bark Friday now also to to to bark back to Har back to Harley's Point earlier notice the top we've got there's only three three or four things that that they had there and I'm sure that um their site probably has a more in-depth navigation uh course I mean we this is the trend we're seeing right now right these sites are built for today yeah built for today I mean when you have when you when you that sounds cheesy but
(14:57) I mean like literally built for Black Friday yeah because you you might be able to do a month like think about the amount of work that you do for a month if you can do that amount of sales in 3 days then you should allocate the same amount of re basically you should respect that time as an additional month of year yeah yeah all right so look like you know 12 hours ago Shopify you know if you looked at that counter when it first came live Thursday night it was about $800,000 a minute now it's $35 million a minute like this isn't just some random thing this is the day the
(15:26) consumers are purchasing and these people have begin to prare how many minutes would we going rough 10 15 I was going to do the simple math just to say while we've been on there's been probably another 50 million in sales that we we got we got a lot to cover here yeah let's do it let's uh let's go to QVC back because this is not unobvious when I told you I was going to talk about QBC you told me you're like are you sure I was like yes trust me on this one and I was like save it for the live because everything you started getting into was like everyone's gonna want to hear this so if you remember if you like me you remember QVC is like
(15:58) what your mom was watching on TV for like the 17th pair of fake jewelry uh that's not fake it's a stone from Africa that was mined in you know whatever right uh and so this is a totally different QVC from what uh I grew up with and probably you grew up with and so yeah Harley take it away okay so QVC the the the way that it used to work is actually very very it used to it was it's a very simple process you had it was a channel that ran like basically indefinitely it was like always on and they had these people coming and presenting these beautiful things check out this if you want this call us now then it evolved
(16:37) and it became if you want this go to this particular web page so actually QVC came to Shopify and they said we actually want to build video on demand they wanted to build something where concurrently with the actual ad the video you can actually purchase right then and there like oneclick checkout and so the way it works is you actually see these product thumbnails show up in the video on demand and it's under like the the hottest holiday host gift Channel um but the thumbnail link over it's guilt on hydrogen which is Shopify is headless product and you can actually
(17:08) check out while you're watching the video the reason this is interesting is because there are way too many ads videos out there where you effectively have to leave the video to go make the purchase meet people where they are if they're watching the video make allow them to continue to watch the video Don't Stop the flow of information don't stop the entertainment value because that's not what they want there's a very high likely of chance if you if you get them to leave the video and go into a checkup like a four page checkup or even a onepage checkup yeah too much friction
(17:36) and so the fact that QVC which is I don't know how how long they've been around someone can probably figure that out but they've been around for many many decades the fact that they've created a seamless like concurrent shopping experience tells me that even older companies are able to innovate and use technology some really cool stuff and I would bet dollars to Donuts that the people who buy once are more likely to buy a second time while they continue to tune in and so it's like we don't want to break this moment so we talk about this in our stuff like we have hyper buying Cycles like there are these moments where buyers will enter so like
(18:08) let's say you you decide you want to start doing a Turkey Trot or you want to do some 5K or whatever well as soon as you make that decision all of a sudden you're like well I want I want new shoes and I want some shorts and I want one of those iPod you know armbands yeah and so if you if you immediately sell the shorts and then they have to leave they are they might forget about that and then they'll remember again but with a different retailer and so it's like when they're in that window a lot of a lot of business owners are afraid to like kind
(18:32) of lean in it's like that's when the when the when the iron is hot strike whatever the saying is um yeah go the other thing I was goingon to say is you know when I was last when I was on your your your your podcast you talked about that you know a lot of people that you you meet with sort of own more traditional businesses gyms there is this this I don't know this thing that I hear a lot which is well this is the way it's done right like I've inherited this business where I bought this company and this is how we do sales This Is How We Do you know are we business I don't believe like if QVC is able to innovate
(19:03) entirely on the process there's no reason that every one of you watching that has a more traditional business is not able to do so um and and I I just I have to give credit credit credit is due it's an amazing experience and the fact that they came to Shopify which is not it's not the traditional Shopify Merchant um I I think is great so I like the idea of reducing friction and common themes here so boom we've got a a top Banner for right now with the code same thing look at say Black Friday right so everybody knows they're in the right
(19:32) place at the right time for them and I will bet you again dollars to Donas that those four boxes that are the first thing that you see underneath those those deals are probably the things that they know are the things that that were getting this this page has already been optimized for conversion they know that these items that they have in each of these categories are the things that people are wanting to buy right now and look at the products right the products are amazing products these are things
(19:55) they want to buy right now they also have this game Spin to Win but they like I don't know just I like the fact that it's it's a clean site it's very obvious what they want to do and it doesn't look like a 50-year-old company not at all yeah the cool thing that QVC has is they probably have more data during this season than maybe like anyone and so they know exactly what people want to buy right now and they and so like also for a smaller retailer or like any kind of smaller business a lot of times we
(20:20) like to think about things as David and Goliath and we're going to talk about a David and goath story in a minute but we have this idea that like we want to like beat the big guys one of the best things you can do is look at what they're doing like if they have a certain different categories that are put up there it's for a reason they've got a team of people that did a ton of research for six months and the cool thing is is that you can use someone else's team in research and basically take the inferences and then still use them for your business yep let's talk about the
(20:45) David and K thing because there there is one store BK Beauty do we have that those up here can you pull pull up BK Beauty there we go okay so um first of all BK Beauty um yeah look like you me yeah uh so fairly simple in terms of the look clean great imagery they you know they give you their endorsements of of like why you should buy from them very simple you know value statements here but here's what's really neat some of the people that at BK Beauty they are actually I think they're the top selling
(21:18) like at all brands on Tik Tok shops which which we power they are the top selling shop bkb I'm not kidding it is unbelievable and most people don't haven't heard of them but here's the thing about BK Beauty they are um they're not glossier they're not Kylie Cosmetics I know I know glossier and Kylie well because they're on shop like Fenty as well they're not like that they're more of a a startup brand and so when you talk about startups you often end up in this like David versus Goliath thing the thing that I think was so genius about what they've done recently
(21:48) is they said look there's Mass like the Cosmetics industry is littered with hedonic like you know uh incumbents big companies out there instead of going head-to-head with them they went actually created Partnerships with them so listen to this they created Partnerships with Maybelline L'Oreal and other major Beauty Brands that were just getting started on Tik Tok they went to them and said look we actually know how to do Tik Tok ads better than you do instead of us competing with you why don't we do collaboration and actually this idea of David Goliath they said it's actually
(22:19) going to be D David actually partners with Goliath and it's amazing to see a startup partner with these very large Brands and uh and and they've done some really cool stuff they've also native migrations I said Tik Tok but they've also used Shopify to Native integrate into YouTube as well so right from a YouTube cosmetic tutorial you're able to buy BK Beauty but they just seem to be doing things completely different um and um and and and so speaking of the different thing so I said that there one of the biggest stores the biggest store in Tik Tok shops they also do traditional marketing usually you see
(22:50) these merchants or these brands that do one of the other they're either the Insurgent or they the incumbent if they're the Insurgent and social media they're doing things that like you know that the big companies can't or they're they're incumbent in the nut traditional marketing yeah BK Beauty you can find them on Tik Tok and you can also find them on The View for example right so they actually they don't they have no um specific biases towards different marketing channels agnostic exactly show me the return on ad spend what is the
(23:18) RAS where can I get my CA to a particular point that it makes sense for me relative to my my lifetime value so that's a company that I just think is doing things completely different they they haven't emulated anybody else and I love the idea of collaboration versus competition and um I'll just say as a as a personal different side note on this is that this direct native integration so this is actually kind of a similar SC to the uh the QVC uh story earlier but um if you have the opportunity it's one of those High leverage things that's worth investing in which like I'll give
(23:49) you a very a simple example like I have uh on Twitter this little box that's inter now I'm sorry Jesus yeah so on X there's uh there's this little box it's like a buy box for people of products but for me I just made it a$ Z product that then just goes to my email list and so because it's so native to to the platform it outperforms relative to my view count compared to other platforms I have because it's so native well same with Tik to like Tik Tok really wants to make Tik Tok shops a thing I don't know how long that's going to last but if you were early on that you did well same thing with YouTube and Spotify when
(24:22) Spotify wanted to get into the podcast business those early podcasts generate a lot of sales because you were actually a your growth with some other company's macro Mission or or you know objective for that particular and they're and they're flooding and so like the David and goli thing is that if you're one of those early uh podcasts it's like spot you get to basically tap into their resources and their distribution and their kind of track record where they get to tap into your Innovation your adaptability and so uh a lot of these big guys like real talk for all the the
(24:54) smaller entrepreneurs here um you are a dangerous player on the board right because they know that given the size of their infrastructure it's so difficult for them to make big bets and everyone's afraid of losing their job and having the bad idea that a lot of these bigger companies just kind of stay relatively stagnant they just let's just stick with the Playbook it's worked for five years it's worked for 10 years don't don't mess and the big companies you know just to say it like they don't have the found they don't have the
(25:18) founder energy right you know I I've often said and I Ben has heard me say this on the gymstar at I was like I bet you there has been some board meeting where someone on the Nike board went up to the the white board said some of our you know major risks is jib shark yeah um that is unbelievable that that a 10-year-old company is an exal threat to a company like Nike but it's true these you know a lot of the small businesses that are that are watching you think that the big companies like you're worried about the big companies eating your lunch they actually are way more
(25:47) worried about you eating their lunch and the reason is they have way more resource they have way more Capital to deployed and invested in their ads so if you use creativity and they're using capital and you beat them well you can with a new idea they can't spend unlimited amounts of money and you can do things as a small business that they can which is things that don't scale so for example I I bought this so my I I bought this this is um if you really like coffee and you're not price sensitive there's a coffee machine called X blue okay X blue um and letter
(26:18) X and blue and it's this beautiful you know the pourover method for coffee do you drink coffee uh probably not so I drink coffee in the morning I have a machine so the like the way to drink coffee is like the Hipster Brooklyn style T of right I don't have the patience for it so X has actually figured out how to actually do that what I loved about it so I bought this coffee machine I found it on on the shop app it was really great but I got a hadn't written note from the CEO from the B of it and the note was like Hey Harley thanks for buying it I love Shopify I watch your have this podcast called Big Shot he's like I like all these things
(26:49) there is no way that any major Coffee Company could have ever done that that doesn't scale yeah so actually you know the X was probably thinking about how Breville is going to eat their lunch but brille should be way more worried about them because xlum can do things that that don't scale and that's where you can get those crazy BR at like basically you can compensate for their lack of capital by having Superior row I'm talking about them right now yeah right I'm talking that like it took them eight minutes or or five minutes do some research on me write that letter and now I've told that story 10 times and
(27:18) that'll probably sell 10 machines yeah it is a great cment it is expensive um okay let's keep going here because there's a lot going on I want to talk about one that is super um which one we Burger King for let's do Burger King okay so this is weird Burger King Size up for Shopify um not our typical Merchant by any means they also don't sell a lot of like physical product that would ship to you their burger restaurant but they created this thing it's called the most Whopper full time of the year and it's a freaking Advent calendar and I was like this
(27:53) thing it's weird and and do you see it there there you go yeah pull it up there okay there it is there we go this thing sells out instantaneously okay um it was 12 items ranging from figurines to Brandon sunglasses um it started on November 22nd uh it was uh it cost $19 54 cents they were created 1954 um and you had $100 worth of of product in it um it was unbelievable it sold it immediately the reason this so interesting is because McDonald's doesn't doing things like none of the competition like this but they were able to create these things that actually are Collectibles it's not for people that like the burgers there it's for people
(28:35) that like pop culture right and they expanded their brand well beyond that but it was this like the thing about Advent calendars even though there's oldest time is it's a it's a consistent reminder but the brand and actually uh Brew dog did one um vages did one fly by Jing did one a lot of great Brands did Advent calendars this year I haven't seen Advent calendars come in in a long time but the reason I think Advent calendars actually could work if you have the right type of product and brand is because it's not a oneand done can
(29:02) you toine admin yeah it's it's basically uh it's it's a scheduled release okay so you you you you buy it could be 30 days in this case we're burking was 12 days but it's it's effectively um something you get um multiple times okay and it's it could be delivered to you all in once or you actually can get it every couple of days for a period of time so you buy it once now there's an element of surprise there's an element of Discovery and mystery about these ADV calor you don't always know what you're getting um and it worked really well one of them so fly by Jing which is um sort of a sauce
(29:35) company very popular sauce company um I don't know if you can pull up fly by Jan they're they're really fascinating um if you can find it it's worthwhile just while they pulled it up this is also the same like Easter egg energy vibe from gyar it's the same idea so look at this and these cheap things this is their Advent calendar it's beautiful but here's the thing they're testing sauce this year for 2025 this is entirely I mean it's a cool product they made money with it but it's also a test of what they should make next year so one of their sauces I'm going to pronounce this wrong but it's
(30:06) not San but Sichuan sauce um was in this and they wanted to know whether or not their fan base was going to like this and and the the presumption was use this like have your your best sellers you know as couple as a couple of these releases but have a couple demos there and see what the crowd thinks of the demos and in fact this completely sold out so this was sold out in 2024 and all they did it strictly by email social media and by text messaging and this is a way for them to test things that they're considering launching next year
(30:37) and they're able to do it through the Advent site and so one of the cool things with this is you can drive huge amounts of scarcity huge amounts of PR around some crazy unscalable thing right like fundamentally you don't know which of these sauces are going to be good hypothetically now every business has their own sauce right their own products there and whatever and so for them they get to say okay well we don't want everyone to try off because might suck right and so but they get their hardcore fans with lots of scarcity lots of urgency tons of earned media that comes as a result of that and then the the big
(31:07) cookie for them is like not only do they get all that stuff they get the data that's right now let's go back for a second to Burger King because the other thing that Burger King did is Burger King typically has their total adress Market is it's large but it's fairly shallow okay I think what they were able to do with this particular calendar this Advent calendar was they were able to create a different relationship to the brand very few Brands can possibly do that a lot of the race car companies do
(31:30) so you may drive a Porsche for example there's a lot of wearing Porsche jackets not not my style like that stuff but that now they're able to like you only you only may drive that car once and a lot of people can't afford the Porsche but a lot of people that cannot afford a Porsche are walking around in Porche merchandise right or Ferrari or Ferrari Ferrari is probably even a greater example of that so that's kind of what Burger King did they're like look the transaction is typically you buy a burger or fries but now actually we're
(31:54) going to create a limited edition product that is going to be super cool and I think that they created a new type of relationship with an um an unobvious um constituency of of their of their of their brand and I I I'll I'll pck you back on two other things I think burer King did really well that we were talking about before this um is that they've been very Nimble and like they're dare I say like becoming almost cool they're almost cool well they're like in fact their their tagline now is forget the forget the clown McDonald's go with the King and then they they did this this massive uh I don't know if you
(32:26) guys saw this but they did this National deal where it was like you could get a a Whopper if you were within 500t of the McDonald's and located it yes yes and so but they so this is how they got this massive adoption of their app was but it's like think about how many different ways could I get adoption of an app it's like but not only did they do it they did it in a fun cheeky way uh so people would drive to McDonald's to then buy the the walk I always thought like uber should do that with push notifications
(32:53) at a particular hour um near bars like near like sixth stade Austin Texas or like you know in in downtown in Vegas or something where you know someone is around is is probably out at a club or a bar they probably had a few drinks why not just say would you like a car right now push it as opposed to have them pull it right and I I I think there's a lot of opportunities or or you know um Uber eat even can kind of do that hey it's late night hungry you just got out of the car yeah right we know you went from the club District to your home you probably want like a snack or something
(33:23) like that when they get into the car you're driving by the time you get home can guarantee that's where you sort of like forget the this is actually I'll take a like we has been public now for 10 years yeah um we're about to celebrate our 10 year anniversary May in May 2024 um this this will be sort of the May 2025 will be our 10 year anniversary we un public May in May 2015 the we did this road show where you meet all these investors we did 93 meetings on the road show I I absolutely loved it data company public I think From aler
(33:54) perspective is like one of the coolest things I was able you know our team rang devel to New York Stock Exchange it was a very special moment but the number one question we got when we were on the road for Shopify was we like the company we like the product but your Tam feels very small your total j market and the reason that that was an annoying question for me or annoying point was they were sort of looking at us taking a bigger piece of the pie rather than growing the P itself and at the time the pie was retail smbs right if you think about shop today a lot of people like that you
(34:25) shop we have B2B business a lot of them are not snbs anymore they weren't able to properly predict what we were going to sell to I think that's what a lot of people do wrong they look at I own a gym therefore the people that I'm going to Target are going to be people that go to other gyms and that's you taking a bigger piece of existing pie instead of thinking about like what if I Target a people that have never been to the gym before how do I grow the pie itself that's how you build real billion dollar
(34:49) companies I think so one of the really interesting so it's obviously I'll jump on the galy but one of the things that we used to talk about is your biggest competition is the couch and so G right exactly it's the couch right and so one of the really cool things is we like to sell in a vacuum in every business you have right because you don't want to price compete you want to be able to have your own unique message that's going to resonate with specific audience and so with when you when you create your Market they don't you're you're
(35:13) everyone's first love they don't know they're not like well you know the other guy down like of course you're going to have some people who price shop but the vast majority of people if you're kind of activating going from 0 to one one the market is a gazillion times bigger and so um it yeah go ahead used to say I I know read a little bit and he used to say the Netflix biggest competition is sleep kind like and I I think that's sort of how you have to think about it that your total deal market for what
(35:38) you're selling is the same Tam as oxygen it just doesn't matter of how do you find your way into it and Burger King is now like again are they going to change their entire business no but they've created this new way for customers to engage with them and I think that's really really cool let's go a butcher boss let's do it okay so um not to be confused with bark Bo yes yes that's right um also beautiful site yeah beautiful photography um are you are you a carnivore oh yeah okay so like so am I like just my mouth is water just kind of looking at this right it's just
(36:16) spectacular so here's the thing so first of all their Black Friday thing in advance of of Thanksgiving was they want to sell as many turkeys as possible okay that was their thing they're like they want to sell turkey now it's it's gone now cuz was last night they've already changed the site but if you would have looked at this two days ago it would have been all about turkeys but here's what they did there is they acquired a company called Truffle Shuffle okay Truffle Shuffle is a really cool company
(36:42) but it's it's it's live cooking classes they acquired them and they did this thing called go gobble paloa and it was all these amazing cooking classes okay they over delivered free information like in an insane way not gimmicky not social like sure like actual incredible things here here you go um and and they gave a this amazing class this class could have been you ever seing like those amazing documentaries on like Netflix about like Chef's tabl it was so beautifully done and there was only like the logical step would be to have a call to action for the class to go directly to you know uh to the brand they didn't
(37:20) do that they simply overd delivered and didn't ask for anything in return knowing that by creating more value than than people expected they would come back the next time and eventually to your point they will say now it's time like like you said about Jim shark eventually they're going to say if you want to actually do this with us next time go buy your own ingredients and here's where you buy it so here's what's really so I love I I like anybody in my world knows that I love this strategy a ton right so one is they went after a media asset first and so they're like okay well we have a superior
(37:49) monetization vehicle than you know this this media company does right they can sell sponsorships or whatever and the thing is that when you when you buy into a media I'm not going to super deep on the m&a side but like whenever you buy media their monetization mechanism is sponsorships right so they run it's and so basically if every one of your competitors and maybe you're running ads in a specific channel it's like well wouldn't it be cool have I got those ads for free yeah right it says fun what did
(38:14) they basically bought all of the ad space forever for one price yeah be the content yes right and so obviously with what we do we do the same I mean I love the strategy is what I um that's why I want to end with this yeah and so we're so I saw a different company do this really well um it was actually Levis and so it was so funny so I was uh I was I was looking for a pair of jeans or something I can't remember it was and they they said how to how to dress this pair of jeans now it's become a little bit more commonplace but the first time I saw it was years ago and they had one guy
(38:43) basically wear this pair of jeans in like six different settings and basically when the video he like would walk in and then it would like freeze for a second so it would it would show all the different things and then it walked out and then another version with the same jeans and so it very subtly cross sold a ton of other things well also say Okay jeans work for a lot because I mean jeans are so like you've got hipsters and jeans you've got working men like it's such a broad category so it's like how do you know even because like even the way that they put the model together is going to automatically only convert a specific
(39:12) type of the audience and so they showed basically four or five different avatars who you're like oh I don't resonate with the Hipster but that one's mine right they basically took a shopping cart and added to their Tam right they're just like they're going down the eye like Tam Tam Tam I I love that stuff also I also think what it does do it makes it invites you in let's say you're not as cool as a hipster but maybe you want to be but you're but you you do you do self-identify one of those other characters you believe oh that's this is
(39:36) for me right and I think that's I think that's really great I also like the fact that you do this well but what I loved about butcher box is they didn't actually ask for there was no call to action to buy during the actual class just check it out just check it out yeah and I think that that is that is remarkable because I don't think that is how traditional marketing typically worked and I think the best companies you don't know that you're being sold to and people want to buy they don't want to be sold that's right and so I had so I had I had a conversation with um Chris
(40:06) Davis who's uh New Balance at CMO and so we had a really good conversation the other day you guys will you guys will get access to it uh my notes from it and one of the most amazing things they did was he basically went all in on this concept and so if you guys have seen the big re you know boom of New Balance he came in and said okay 70% of our advertising budget is going towards bottom of funnel so me meaning like direct asks go buy shoes whatever right and only 30% is dedicated to storytelling kind of value creation emotional kind of you know identification for an audience whatever
(40:38) and so what he did was he said let's flip that and then for 18 months it basically didn't pay off at all and then at month 19 it just and then it just started taking off like a rocket and there's a couple of like I think meaningful lessons from that it was probably my it was probably my most significant story that I heard this year at least for me and so number one is given the amount of spend that those guys have it still took a year and a half and so if you were and they're New Balance right yeah they're like people know who they are already and so I think it's like the patience game of this is
(41:07) so big especially when it comes to Brand because I think one of the things that uh obviously we broke down the sites we should you know there's banners there's specific coupons everybody optimized their page for the day there was specific urgency there was clear three offers or four offers that they knew they streamlined the top part this one didn't have one it just has Banner um but the stuff that's happening outside of this is the stuff that really dictates how well well this is going to go right how much give has happened
(41:30) prior to this ask um is almost directly proportional to the amount of sales that they're generating um can we put up the the globe for a second because I want there's one more thing I want to sort of point out here which I think is interesting so you know you're looking at millions of stores it's great we're about to go to North America when you see these stores there's this often most people have this assumption that those are well that's Alo yoga and those are like the big ones on to that's not those are like millions of different stores the one thing though that I think that
(41:54) is remarkable now is if you sort of think the consumer side of it my my big takeaway from like Black Friday 2024 is that consumers actually prefer to buy direct with people that that they believe are behind the product that this idea of dis mediation isn't just a fat direct to Consumers on a fat that ultimately if you want someone to come to your gym don't put some model up on the ad put you up on the ad people actually want to buy from other people so one is I think consumers are voting with their wallets to buy the directly
(42:24) from the people behind it and even larger Brands like you know with Fenty it's right like like my favorite shirt is is James purse and I think he makes the best black t-shirts like J James puts himself out there to the extent that I feel like he cares more about black tach than anybody else right there's this there's this inherent personal personalization and personality to it that's the first thing the second thing is we talked about this a bit today but there is no online versus offline there is no Channel you sort of use a great term I think you said uh advertising agnostic it's ALS we're all
(42:56) Channel agnostic now oh yeah like there is no I buy a line I pick up in store it is literally just about consumer choice and if you think back you know 30 years 300 years I don't know maybe 3,000 years how retail was done the retailer the the the merchant dictated the consumer how to buy if you want to buy bread at the you know at a At This Town Square 300 years ago you go to the baker the baker would say here's my hours of operation here's how you pay wait in line here the one major thing that is clear clear to me through this is that things have been flipped in their head now the consumer
(43:31) is saying no no I'm going to purchase in the most convenient way for me which means I'm going to buy it online if I want or Buy in Tik Tok or Instagram or the online store buy a mobile app or buy a Marketplace but I think if you have an opportunity you're watching this right now to sell across different channels even though that's not what I'm I'm not a physical retailer Ben Francis Jim shark was not a physical retailer they're an online retailer and they're killing it in physical retail right now because they don't give a [ __ ] it doesn't matter where you B and I swear they don't care where you buy they care
(44:00) that you buy they care you have a great experience that is a future of retail and one of the reasons that I think that it's reflected here is because this is like this is means that entrepreneurship is becoming so democratized that companies didn't exist five years ago are now beating the [ __ ] out of the biggest companies in the world I don't know how Macy is doing today I don't know how Best Buy is doing today but I assume they're not doing as well as these people are doing because they simply are are too removed from the transaction from the value creation and I think like your point like value first
(44:29) right like soft ask give people more than they expect and then eventually they'll they'll give you what you they'll give you their their hard dollars so I'm GNA go I'm go super historical because you said 3,000 years Sor no it's good and so you think about the Roman Empire right and so there was this period of time before Shopify before social media where a lot of things got democratized by technology right um where but what defeated the Roman Empire it wasn't another massive Empire it was lots of Barbarians nibbling at the sides and then
(44:58) eventually obviously no silver bullets yeah hundreds of golden BB's that's theame right and so the thing is is that we as entrepreneurs represent those golden BBS and so that market share is these are gold BS literally literally is that market share is up for grabs and you can out the thing is it's like you can always out compete so I'm just going to draw here so it's like you're not going to beat somebody at the world right it's it's very tough to do that if you're starting out but you can be the absolute mayor of this tiny little duck
(45:28) and say like in this world if if you if you were an entrepreneur who uh likes black t-shirts I am obsessed with black t-shirts and people are like you know what there's these other brands that I like but I'm gonna black my I'm gonna buy my black t-shirts from this guy James James Pierce right and it's because like well I'm sure they have this whole catalog at for wori or whatever but like this guy just loves black I have a black T-shirt guy that's all I want to wear that's exact and actually so I just actually I pulled up I want so uh the top trending products
(45:57) right now across the world these are millions of Stores um it is an Alpine waffle beanie from viori it is a two-piece pajam set from Little sleepies it's a blanket from Lola blankets it's a lip liner from Victoria Beckham it's a peptide lip treatment I don't know what that is from Road and it's hair Ser from Olex these are not like other than viori I haven't bought anything in any of these stores yeah but there's a there's a massive business called Lola blankets that sells blankets and I'm willing to bet given that they're trending right now now across millions of stores they
(46:29) probably really give a [ __ ] about blanket and I'm pretty sure that little sleepies really cares about sleep wear and pajamas so this idea of taking a niche and blowing it up and inviting more people to participate you can build these multi-million dollar I mean or billion dollar companies in your Niche if you do that one thing really really well and this is where the Tam expands right and so you you think about like okay well sleep wear pajamas well the traditional person would look at that be like well okay what's the what's the number of pajamas
(46:57) sold every year or sleepware that sold every year and be like all right why think I can capture 5% or 10% but the thing is is like what we don't take into consideration is like can I make sleepware cooler than being naked yes tough on that one but like can I make it cooler than maybe a Mumu or a big t-shirt or whatever and so it's like okay that's what that's I'm I'm fighting the couch I'm fighting sleep and I think that's where these new categories can emerge and then you can so quickly with online now scale like to the Moon well I was actually going to say that as well so the percentage of crossb orders right
(47:26) now is is getting to 20% Which is quite remarkable because what that really means is that in 2024 the businesses that I admire the most they are default Global now again if you run a gym in a particular City that may be more difficult I understand that but if you were able to sell to a larger audience let's say you're based in Las Vegas I mean Canada's not that far that's where I come from like it's a three-hour flight there's 40 million people there and the average household income is pretty much the same as United States so you have another 40 million people right
(47:56) there yeah most shipping companies will go there uh at least for now we have free trade agreements so it's not that difficult for you to ship there so this idea of saying well I'm I'm a I'm a us-based or I'm a Canadian based company like the fact that jym shark is based in the UK I think most people don't even know that fact that Shopify is based in Canada I assume most people don't know that because it doesn't matter it's 2024 right we are all default Global and I think that is also an amazing opportunity that if it's working in this geography it's very easy to expand if
(48:25) you do it well and that is where this little dot over here just starts just starts being this little this little this little dot that could right and realistically what happens is it actually grows outside of the original town right is that there's whole other group of people and maybe you capture this little bit here that says you know what this I do like their pajamas better than someone else's but all these people are like man I like this just better than than whatever I was doing before I I'll personalize it so um one of my best friends in the world is a guy named David seagull David seagull created a
(48:54) company called David's te David T I met David in 2015 he was taking David's Tea public I was taking shop light public so he he built a billion dollar I like he took the company public it was an $800 million market cap company and it was I think there were 350 David te retail locations all over North America amazing T entrepr he ends up leaving the company and we're it's it's during the pandemic we're sitting around I'm like what do you want to do next he's like I don't really know I'm thinking about doing
(49:20) this or that I was like you're obsessed with tea he's like yeah I know I was like how you thought about doing high-end tea like really great well cuz I was like I drink I I drink tea but I have no idea what I'm drinking right I'm like green tea please or mint tea I'm like what about teaching the world about really highend tea great product exactly right teach people about it and he's like well the problem is we tried to do the David's Tea and it was too it was too highend it didn't work for that audience David was a mass audience a lot
(49:44) of flavors a lot of like you know like tropical flavors very sweet and so they're like it was too small of an audience I was like but what if we do it if if we just do it the two of us we built this thing called Firebelly t.com it's small company but we have one particular demographic it's for people that love high in and even though it's a small little dot in a larger T Market because we're the best of what we do in that particular Market it's actually real business it makes real money so I think that there is like you may be working in a company right now you I
(50:13) don't I don't like this term but like you know like entrepreneur an entrepreneur working in a big company and there may be something right now in that company that you think is a great idea but that compan is like it's too small of an opportunity it's priority seven and we're only the top three you may be able to start that thing and it may be big enough for you and 10 people to work on together even though the Fortune 500 thinks it's not that big of a deal sure and I actually think that is where those opportunities for entrepreneurs are endless yeah those
(50:42) crumbs on a uh on a hundred billion doll Cookie prom on that cookies enough to set you up for the rest of shop shop app store right we have 13,000 apps in shop Play App Store so if you're an entrepreneur you're a merchant you can find all these amazing apps and often we're asked why don't we build it ourselves well because we can't do that we have millions stores we have to do what most people need most of the time so we leave room for people to build their own companies and through that clavo is a billion dollar company uh
(51:08) aerm is a multi-billion dollar company we partner with stripe companies that were built on the ecosystem we actually encourage them we want you to go build because it's not something that we can do because we're focused on like you know transactions and check out and Order and inventory and Order management the bigger things we have to I think those are huge opportunities and that's all collaboration I'll just say that because I know Harley off camera too and like he collaboration is like in his bloodline totally um it's like I mean
(51:33) he's probably the most gregarious guy I've met like like if I if I like needed to connect with like the president of Zimbabwe I'd probably text you first be like oh yeah so I don't know his name I'm GNA mess something up but um I don't know the president of Zimbabwe I'm sure he's a great person and I think he should be an entrepreneur as well yeah I think he should start some sort of Zimbabwe you know butcher box you know company Bark Box type company and I'll bring this I I think I'll bring this on here but the the list of items that Harley just read as the top the top
(52:01) selling items that are happening across all of Shopify so number one everything that we just went is from the the horse's mouth the man who yeah you're hearing it first now I did like I did CNN I did like ABC I did CBS like I didn't mention some of these on there like this is this is for you and your community you were my people I am an entrepreneur like all of you and so but this is from pulling back the curtain of the things that these guys are doing it and Harley knows the the CMOS and the CEOs of each of these companies and got
(52:25) to I'm sure participate in some of these conversations that led to uh led to the creation I remember when some of these these companies were getting started their mom's kitchen table and they a lot of them had the same question I'm sure you all you all had I think the difference is that one like the head I mean if you're an entrepreneur you got to be you pers right like you know I I I always described as like like they're two types of people big Title Wave is coming and you have the people that run for the towels on the shore and you have
(52:49) the people that go get the surfboard yeah and like uh you know entrepreneurs are the surfboard people yeah and they're the ones that build these massive global companies think it's like a golden age of Entrepreneurship you know one thing we didn't talk about we talked about opportunity but also the cost of failure right now it's about as low as it's ever been so in terms of your you know 100 or 1,000 BBS you can throw out those BBS because if one doesn't work it doesn't mean you're going to lose your house so I I give this analogy of the lottery ticket which is like every entrepreneur has this like
(53:16) ultimate stack of lottery tickets and so you can scratch them off and cash them in and the thing is is that if you lose you're back at the exact same position you are at so you have basically unlimited shots on goal right now for the cost of probably a sub you know a software subscription and if you compare this to the the bakery that you uh have to start you know in 1930 where you have to work for 10 years put up half the money yourself sign away everything so that if for some reason the bakery doesn't work that's it for you that's it
(53:40) for life you'll never have a loan again you'll never yeah that's that's that's that's all you get and so it's like we have so many more shots on goal that the difficulty is so what's the what's the what's the competition for entrepreneurship it's distraction it's your phone it's it's it's never been easier to be successful and it's also never been easier to be distractive it's also hard like you know um I'm Canadian so I don't celebrate us Thanksgiving we have Thanksgiving another time but I suspect last night a bunch of you were sitting around your your dinner table
(54:04) with your family and they're like you know they're going around the table and you got like cousin David who's a doctor and you got like you know cousin Jennifer who's a CPA she's an accountant she works at you know some big accounting firm and they get to you like what are you do you're like oh I'm an entrepreneur they're like oh like how's the Tik Tok guys right exactly so like I I have felt like that my entire life it was I I kid you not we I've been at shop now for almost 16 years I'm 40 so more
(54:27) than the third of my life and I think it was only around like the IPO maybe a year after the IPO that my mom and dad were like okay like now I realized why you'd become legit you are legit so like I feel that too um because it is a little lonely totally right I mean entrepreneurship has a lot of perks and a lot of wonderful benefits but it's also qu quite lonely and unlike I think our our parents and grandparents Generations it's not celebrated like it is now usually people went into entrepreneurship there's this term called forced entrepreneurship that's why most people did for like most people
(54:57) became entrepreneurs in the in the like 30s 40s 50s and 60s because they had no other choices we are now choosing to be entrepreneurs because we're deeply passionate people who really give a [ __ ] want to build cool stuff the older Generations don't understand it as as well I think and I think the the the point you made about legitimacy is something that I I'll just I'll just make my quick statement which is um for everybody who's watching this that that is a struggle that all entrepreneurs go to at at every level and so some people call it impostor syndrome I I've never really resonated with that that term but
(55:27) the idea that you're like no one thinks I'm Legit right but fundamentally if you have a product and you sell it and customers are happy and you exchange goods and services for money you own a business period as long as you're you know abiding by the law right guess you could have an IL legal business but as far as far as I'm concerned I'm encouraging you know legal entrepreneurship um that's it that's legitimacy and if someone has a problem with you doing that [ __ ] them the snide comments at the at the
(55:53) thing oh yeah he's got his little te thing how's that going little guy but the thing is is that no one everyone thinks about today not forever and so like Shopify is celebrating their 10th year but like 10 years as much as that's a long time it also isn't that long to go from what did you guys IPO at a billion a billion so going from a billion to 150 billion in 10 years right and so uh I think I mean Microsoft was I think seven years from from inception to to their IPO and was a you know it took it took us 10 years to get to the
(56:24) billion from right like we were snowboard shop yeah that we were a snowboard shop in Ottawa Canada above a a buffet restaurant right and there's this and the thing is is there's this as you said endurance right there's this perseverance that has to kick in basically business is an infinite game and the only way that you lose is that you give up and so many of the permutations of the biggest companies in the world right now started as as surf jop slack started as something completely different than gam company right completely different and so your
(56:52) first business won't be your last business it's very unlikely that you're Zuckerberg or your BOS most most people have like I have nine nine failures before my first real big one and so like it's just part of the game I know you did t-shirts you did DJ I've done so many other things have not worked out you know the one thing that you and I have to do better and and maybe maybe we should do this maybe you do this better than I do but I often will talk about the Highland reel I don't talk about the bloopers right I talk a lot about t-shirts and DJs DJ which went well for Shopify of course but I don't talk about
(57:19) I had a slipper company I had a poker chip company I had a bunch of stuff that that that failed miserably um but I didn't like this idea that that you can just like have that endurance that the next one has the same motivation as the previous one I think works really well and like we are literally looking at like I pray at the altar of Entrepreneurship and these this is the result of Entrepreneurship you know $2.
(57:44) 8 million every single minute this is not coming from like you know this is the longtail shop ofice stor that are generating that are sell to 30 million unique shoers 30 million that's almost that's almost the population in the entire country of Canada where I come from and soil itself I think being able to separate failure from being a failure so basically failing from being a failure and so like failing actually makes you more likely to be successful than not because you don't take any shots right and so it's just making sure that you make that shift um and whether it's also at the higher level whether it's a new product line I mean like we
(58:16) talk about specific businesses but there have been products or features that you rolled out like oh that was shiing we we shop F we bought a company for you know for over a billion dollars and ended up selling it for for you know like because we didn't we needed to get out of it it was it didn't make sense for us we were we sort of called these things like main quest and side quests and we felt that shipping was a side quest and eventually we said we let to go back to our M Quest and so we still make a lot of mistakes but the key is that I'm not make not
(58:42) make that mistake twice and I think you also have to read sort of the the teager in the environment like right now if you're a publicly traded company there is no room I think frankly generally if you're a company at any scale whatsoever there's no room for growth at all costs right like you like you want to grow a business properly but you also want to show that you can be profitable um so like now a couple years ago maybe that was different but I I think you sort of have to react to like what the macro environment dictates from um but more
(59:10) importantly I think entrepreneurship is the greatest thing in the world I think it's the greatest way for humans to self self-actualize I think it it creates it allows people to find their own definition of success whatever that might be and doesn't matter what your last name is or who your father like my father you know is not anyone who would ever know he was a failed entrepreneur he a wonderful man he supported me but he was never able to help me financially and it doesn't make a difference because
(59:34) the value that I am my value as an entrepreneur is how much value I create not who I am and that's sort of where I think entrepreneurship is like this great equalizer yeah it's all based on performance all performance doesn't matter Nothing Else Matters which personally is something that I've always been very attracted to which is like you don't have it's not based on your ability to to to kiss the boss's ass no exactly like how good are you right one more thing this is this is this is how this is how I like to think things all right so we're going to do a Rapid Fire recap of the tactics that we talk we're
(1:00:04) have to take off my shirt sort of like yeah we're going to do it we're going to strip down it's it's strip tactics okay so right off the bat we have um this a mess hold on we started here I think right was gym shark yeah okay here we go so gym shark number one so uh they had an offline present so this was big I'll put a little check mark here okay so online company offline presents yes uh they wo in these little Easter eggs into their marketing to get their uh Their audience and their fans excited about their
(1:00:33) marketing like literally excited about the product and it was like a bit of a secret right it was like an Open Secret of like what what are they going to do next yes exactly now also in terms of products they weren't trying to sell everything they were trying to be more focused on the few products that were going to drive the most Revenue that they because they did a 12we popup probably already knew and will know from next for next year what they're going to do next and crush it yeah I I love it I mean can you imagine the meeting where they're like What's So holiday popup
(1:00:56) great how longone like let's do it for three months and they're like it's a holiday popup they're like do it for three months and they did it I think they're winning it's a long like a crispy crispy popup I what um also just making sure that the sites that you have during the seasons where people have their credit card out are optimized for conversion so like there is a time for Branding there is a time for making an ask and when the when the going is good go hard now uh we covered the pre-test winner so I'm going to I'm to we're going to go to what do we got we got Bark Box okay so Bark Box did this great
(1:01:26) great thing which I think every B I mean I'm a huge huge this is a star one for me quizzes challenges in-depth data collection so that you can personalize a discount or personalize an experience I think makes it just it just it you get data they get something back in return everybody wins and then you get all the remarketing on the back end it's just like a super super if you want to see who does challenge based Commerce better than anyone on the planet it's a company called Mischief you heard of Mischief I
(1:01:53) believe it's spelled like this yeah yeah okay okay Mischief so Mischief does these crazy things where they'll say there is a PT Cruiser remember the PT Cruiser there's a PT Cruiser in this block radius with the door unlocked and the keys in the ignition if you can find it you get to keep the PT Cruiser and they do these crazy Subs all the time but they are the masters of creating these like these gamification and if you're interested in this particular topic go study mischief and so if you're like okay where does that fit in my marketing strategy so when we were
(1:02:22) talking about the new balance of the 70% this is basically delayed Ras is that you're putting this money in saying okay well instead ofing spending you know again this is scale here but let's say you spend a million dollar a month in advertising if you say you know what we're going to spend 50 Grand on this car and we're going to give it away you will probably get more than just spending 5% more on your ads right so there's this point where you get these trade-offs we having the story and the emotional connection Etc is is Big Time
(1:02:46) um I like highlighting this which is if if you have when the going is good make sure that you've got something where first-time buyers know what to get now most of these stores had like a keystone offer that they had either it was line with their banner and even on the on the bottom left for desktop where it was just like hey this is the like start here go here um I love directing I mean every every everything that I put on my site says start here like just this is where you start leave the breadcrumbs
(1:03:09) leave them down the road you want them to take yeah yeah so common theme here obviously prioritize best products making sure that you have urgency in the banner these are super uh super tactical things and authorized for the date it doesn't not every day is Black Friday I get that but there are particular days like you know like New Year's is a day Christmas is a day boxing day whatever it is like there are partic Halloween there are particular days where you can simply just add a very simple new theme
(1:03:32) or skin your site to make it to make it so it's so timely that you know you need to check out right now because tomorrow you know it's going to be totally different I can virtually guarantee you that if you put a seasonal rapper so in the offers book the last chapter is about the wrapping paper with like how do you change your offer on a consistent basis without changing your business right and so my my theme Here is become a fraternity party player right like if Tom gets his his tooth pulled out it's
(1:03:55) like Ker wisdom teeth right like you it doesn't matter what the reason why is just that you have a reason so that you can have your promotion and so it could be your daughter's birthday it could be your anniversary of your wedding it doesn't matter uh as long as you say hey I'm celebrating my anniversary and because of that everything that's couples related boom and you can get that information through these challenges right and this is why this is like a super high leverage all right boom so next one is
(1:04:22) QVC this is low low tech means high tech Okay so oh this one I like because on the video Dem man like QVC this is to me a story of creating the least amount of friction even though QVC has done something for decades a particular Way new technology came out they made it less like again this is concurrent video you don't have to leave the video to buy you can buy write them there through a thumbnail they are if if they can change their way after 50 years because new technology made it easier everyone else can can do that I think it's amazing and
(1:04:51) so I'm just say like what's the fundamental of this it's frictionless yeah right it's dreamline it's it's meeting the customer where they're at and every single every business can take one step towards your customer what is crazy is that when you take one step it's an order of magnitude Improvement in terms of conversions um BK Beauty I mean this is like you know like you don't have to compete with the biggest companies if you want to you can but also there's T like some of these big companies I kid you not you're sitting up you're watching this right now they they are scared of you and so rather
(1:05:19) than you going ahead and and competing with them they got a big budgets some of them are worth comp collaborating with not competing with you may actually create something amazing they're going to love it maybe they can pay for your ad budget and you just made you made yourself less of a risk to them and you can sell more product and this is coming from somebody who's in these boardrooms who's talking to these big Brands so I want there to be like credibility behind what car no this is real the biggest brands on the planet are scared of not
(1:05:44) their their exact competition they're scared of two people in a garage yeah who's going to be the next the next guy to defr them all right so we got Burger Kake so uh having the Advent calendar the promo calendar I can't believe we have Burger King on it's awesome awesome yeah and so uh they you know obviously they were cheeky with their their marketing they're like almost cool now which where like I don't want to say like I think they're almost cool um and using their Advent calter to test I mean this is this emphasis that we talk about gym shark U obviously Burger King did it but I think this is like it's it's a
(1:06:14) it's a it's a multi- dip right like I I love talking about like how can I get double dip or triple dip or quadruple dip on a one move that I make and so this gets lots of PR it gets lots of earned media it gets lots of shares lots of people paying attention it generates sales it allows you to reward the most hardcore fans and it allows you to collect data so that next year you have a a huge advantage over your competition or at least what you would have done if you didn't have the data to sell more
(1:06:38) product y love it all right and then butcher box I mean this is sort of this is like this is you this is like like like this is totally it is all about giving give more value provide more value to them that you capture for yourselves and do that over and over again until you're ready to say now it's time for us to share in this upside but this idea of creating classes with no call to action no sales pitch just here's an amazing class here's another amazing class oh by the way this next class if you want to buy if you want to cook like simultaneously here's here's a link to actually buy the ingredients it
(1:07:09) just creates this different Rel it doesn't feel like you're being sold to I mean this has been my entire marketing strategy and so I'm I'm like I'm super privy to this and the thing that I will I will highlight and that I want to push back on because there's I can hear I can hear the comments saying well must be nice right of well how how they they could acquire something like that right like they can do that but or or this doesn't apply to my business as an accountant or this doesn't apply to my business as a whatever literally so this is my this is Alex's Pro my my true
(1:07:39) cents on this is that marketing and sales are one Continuum first off all right so they're not like these two separate functions just because of have different people do them does not mean that the actual psychological process is different and as far as I'm concerned all of that acquisition process is a process of education and so all we're so if we Define education as uh a change of behavior with under the same conditions so if same conditions new Behavior someone has learned we have educated and so the point of marketing is to change their behavior under the same conditions of what we of what we put out and so if somebody comes in as a
(1:08:09) regular T user and then all of a sudden finds out that these te's contain some things that aren't as good and these te's are much better they digest better they they're more cognitive clear they're deeper taste whatever then all of a sudden you you move you're like oh I'm no longer a normal teego or I'm actually I kind of do like these higher you mentioned accountants for example I assume that's one of one of the greatest examples because the tax code changes fairly rapidly in most countries even in
(1:08:33) the US right if you put every time the tax code change if you put in a 60c video that says here's everything you need to know about section 8722 this new change 60 seconds and you do it again and again if someone is looking for a new accountant yeah they're like who do I actually go to take advice from most oh yeah it's this person on YouTube who whats up these great 60-second videos I'm going to see if he's available or she's available he's obsessed with black t-shirts right like he's obsessed with the tax and specifically okay so we're thinking about C so we'll just let's use this
(1:09:02) give me the overhead so if this is you're like well I'm not going to compete with PWC or ey or some of the big County it's like yeah but but all we got to do is beat them with plumbers and E by the they are never e all those big firms they're never going to be able to do a 60-second video that's organic like that it'll have to compliance and committees and all that you can out compete them because you can go faster it's amazing and so uh with this this is the back Black Friday wrapup from behind the scenes from the man of the myth the legend the president of Shopify Harley
(1:09:33) thanks so much for coming up manate so much fun and uh thank you all for joining us this was unhinged and wonderful so me at least appreciate you guys rock and roll enjoy the weekend enjoy the holidays get back to work

5 Things that BILLIONAIRES think about that MILLIONAIRES don't... - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on OSI Nation you're here with Alex fosi YouTube's richest YouTuber uh or richest YouTuber to be um I'm King for those you guys who don't know me my name is Alex rosi we own acquisition. comom we do about $85 million a year I got a question the other day that was five things that millionaires think about uh that poor people don't and I wanted to change that to billionaires uh and that is because a lot of millionaires have terrible beliefs and uh you know I tend to agree with Grant Cardone on this one which is
(00:26) uh don't listen to millionaires listen to billionaires so you can choose to listen to me or not I hope that we will be uh billionaires in the next you know 10 to 15 years uh but we still have lots of work to go and hopefully the world doesn't melt down between now and then all right so these are the five things that billionaires think about that millionaires do not think about number one is the size of the opportunity a lot of times millionaires were pursue what most billionaires would consider small fries or small chips table staks things
(00:51) that are just not that interesting um because there's just not a huge amount of growth potential now when you're getting started it's not stupid to Niche down many of the biggest business in the world started with a niche but they had the ability or possibility to build something that was going to be truly enormous and so the total adjustable Market or the potential scale of a business itself is something that a billionaire will think about that a millionaire will not the second thing that millionaires do not think about or
(01:16) mistakenly prioritize is they prioritize promotion over product the biggest question that a billionaire will ask about a company is will people continue to buy this product over and over and over again and stated differently is this something that people will never stop buying if people will never stop buying this thing then it will be inevitable that we will make money right that is how they were thinking most millionaires on the other hand just learn promotion and because that is how they made their first money because they
(01:45) didn't make any money and then they start learning how to promote and they make some money they assume that I should just do more promotion and with the exception of very big Mass Market brands that are direct to Consumer and have big ticket items you know for example solar would be one where you you know promotion is going to matter a lot because you really are going to only send sell someone one time on this for 30 years so promotion is going to matter more in that situation but most businesses have a recurring nature of
(02:07) some sort right and so making sure that the product is good enough that when we put the promotion behind it people do not stop purchasing it so that we can get outsized Returns on our marketing and our business model overall it's something that billionaires will think about and not millionaires the third thing that millionaires will will will will mistake here is they will make the mistake of thinking I can do this myself or I'll just underpay just a handful of people to to to run this with me so they will have what we call the genius with
(02:35) the Thousand slaves model versus army of smarter people so the second criteria that I heard Steven schwarzman who's the uh owner of or not owner the founder of Blackstone he's worth about $30 billion talk about was that first he looks at the size of the opportunity and the second thing that he looks at is drum roll can I find 10 out of T who want to pursue this opportunity and so here's the interesting thing big to Talent only chases big opportunity and the reason and he says this quote and it hit me really hard he said well he didn't say
(03:08) this to exactly but I'm paraphrasing he said it's harder to start a small business than it is to start Blackstone because big talent doesn't want to go pursue a small business opportunity think about that for a second that one totally shook me to my core right is that the reason we have to have these big goals is not just for ourselves to get through the muck of of of wanting more and going and suffering through the trials and tribulations that come with entrepreneurship but also so that everyone around us can stomach it
(03:35) because they believe in where we are going and it is something that is true and it's a vision uh that is compelling uh and the opportunity and also the compensation that they can make right if you you're running a dry cleaning store it's very difficult to attract 10 out of 10 Talent there and I Define 10 out of 10 Talent as people who are the best in the world at the thing right nine out of 10 Talent is the best people in the world that I can attract given my company right and eight is somebody who is very very good at the thing and takes
(04:02) initiative and can yield outsize returns a seven is someone who is functional but has to take direction to execute right and a six and Below you don't want them in your business anyways right and the vast majority of businesses are run by sixes and belows let's be real if you're looking at your team most of the team is probably not best in the world or best in the world that you can get right of course not and that is probably because the size of the opportunity that you're chasing is not that good number four is
(04:27) time Horizons most millionaires and people who don't make a lot of money think in very short time increments they think in this week and this month they're thinking can I make payroll can I make rent and I understand that but the reason that the people gain outsized returns who are wealthier is because they see time as an asset rather than a liability they see time working for them rather than against them they see the opportunity compounding in and of itself because they have time on their side and so the smart person the billionaire will
(04:53) look at the opportunity say does time help me or hinder me in this opportunity because I have this little quote that I like a lot I prefer to play games where if you wait you win I'll say it again I prefer to play games where if you wait you win where success is an inevitable consequence of time you may not know when but you do know whether you will get there I would rather get rich for sure and get rich slowly then never get rich at all always hoping that I'll make it in the next 90 days which is what the vast majority of millionaires think
(05:23) they're only thinking about their next promotion they're only thinking about their next campaign they're only thinking about the next thing they're going to do rather than thinking big picture sure if I do this for the next 10 years what is going to position me for where I want to be and ultimately the opportunity that I want to pursue and five the last thing that billionaires will prioritize over millionaires is brand and this is something that I didn't understand really early on I thought brand was a waste of money I thought branding was
(05:46) stupid but a different way of saying brand is reputation right and I heard a a a man that I that I do business with frequently say this and I really like this a lot he said you only get one name you only get one and I it really it really struck me because I just thought that was such a such a Consolidated way of communicating the point we only get one name and the thing is is that your brand compounds with time the more decisions you make that are integrous that are aligned that are not short-term in thinking that are not sacrificing
(06:17) your integrity to get the short dollar which is candidly what most people do most people do that right and that's why most people have a so so or poor brand right they're like yeah he's pretty good but you know he kind of does some stuff every once in a while that's a little shady right but if you have an impactable brand the other types of people that you will track will be people who have impactable Brands and I can tell you this is that the the the area on the top of the mountain is very very sparsely populated
(06:42) they're not a lot of people at the top they all know each other it's crazy and you know why it's because they seek out people who see the world the same way they see the world and it's an exception to the rule rather than the vast majority and so if you want to have game recognized game if you want those people to sit across the table and look at you as an equal then it starts with the character of the person and if the character is right the billionaire will bet on the character of the individual knowing that they will get to where
(07:09) they're trying to go eventually in enough time because it is in inevitability provided the values continue and so when you're making the business decisions taking the long route that takes longer but will most certainly compound and make you wealthier in the long run is what billionaires will do rather than millionaires all right and so I wanted to make this about billionaires rather than millionaires because candid if you just know how to run some ads You Can Be A Millionaire right you can learn how to promote and sell stuff the stuff you
(07:35) might sell might suck but you might make enough money to be a bli a millionaire but to be a billionaire you got to play the game for a long time which means you have to understand that you must play the game for a long time in order to become a billionaire and if you're playing the game for a long time to be a billionaire then all your decisions are going to be made within that time Horizon and the context that that that that come with that the decision-making process and so if we're thinking about this if there one thing that you can
(08:01) take away from this that billionaires would think about that millionaires do not is understanding the time Horizon right because all of these other components roll into that right if we have a long time Rison we doing this forever I don't want to be the one who's doing it all so I don't want to be the genius with a thousand slaves I want an army of smarter people who are going to do this on my behalf I want 10 out of tens who are pursuing this opportunity and can grow it without me right if I want this to truly be something that is
(08:28) going to change my life I can't pursue a small thing for my entire life I got to pursue something big because it has to be worth it because and I heard this from schwarzman and I love it too he said small goals and big goals are equally hard so you might as well make it worth it right it's just as hard to accomplish making $100,000 a year it is as it is for somebody to make a billion dollars a year think about it the time requirement is the same arguably it's less to make a billion dollars a year you just have to think differently about
(08:52) it if I'm going to be around for a very long time I'm going to outlive my promotion and so only thing that will remain will be the product and what people talk about with the product and the decisions that I chose to make with my brand because I was thinking long term and so everything comes down to this concept which is can you think Beyond this week this month this quarter and think when I look back 80 years from now are the decisions that I'm making right now the ones that I would be proud of that are aligned with the long-term
(09:21) goal of seizing the big opportunity that is worth fighting for and so this is what I have I have learned and gleaned from the the handful of billionaires that I talk to and I constantly am trying to analyze them and think what do they have that I don't and maybe it's that I'm just too young and I just need to keep doing what I'm doing which is often times the response that I get and so anyways mosy Nation the reason I make this channel is uh is because there's a lot of broke people and I don't want you to be one of them these are the traits
(09:44) that billionaires will will will look through the lenses of rather than millionaires who often make short-term short-sighted mistakes um in pursuing uh their goals and so I don't want you to do those so anyways my name is O mosy Like I said acquisition. if you liked it hit sub subscribe if you didn't I'll love you either way and I'll guys see you guys in the next video bye

2 Types of Business Risk and the One I Choose EVERY TIME - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A9qHKjFPJ-E

Transcript:
(00:00) there are two big risks that exist in business the first is the execution risk the second is the idea risk now you could maybe make an argument for a third being you know environmental risk regulatory risk things like that but i would say big picture is does the idea fundamentally work you know is dr having strangers drive kids around in cars is going to be a really good idea uber right or creating lockers for cats is that going to be a good idea i don't know right or am i going to be able to execute the idea itself and if you don't
(00:27) know who i am my name is doctor mosey i own acquisition.com it's a portfolio of companies that over 100 million a year i like talking about business stuff and hopefully making fewer people broke in the world makes me die happy okay so i was having a really good conversation with a friend of mine uh who's a software entrepreneur he's had three or four software companies none of them have really hit and he's about the same age as me and he and i sit in very different financial positions at this point in our life and we were having a
(00:50) really in-depth conversation around this topic which is appropriately measuring risk and so one of the issues that i see with a lot of newer entrepreneurs is that they overestimate the payoff for a risk and underestimate the cost number one and second is they overestimate the likelihood of success they're going to have and they underestimate the risk in terms of the likelihood that they fail and i think this is really interesting because he and i were discussing the first quote that i have that's kind of it's in the intro of my book uh by jeff
(01:16) bezos i'll read it to you right now outside returns often come from betting against conventional wisdom and conventionalism is usually right given a 10 chance of 100 times payoff you should take that bet every time but you're still going to be wrong 9 times out of 10. we all know that if you swing for the fences you're going to strike out a lot but if you're also going to hit some home runs the difference between baseball and business however is that baseball has a truncated outcome distribution when you swing no matter
(01:37) how well you connect with the ball the most runs you can get is four in business every once in a while when you step up to the plate you can score a thousand runs this long tail distribution of returns that's why it's important to be bold big winners pay for so many experiments jeff bay says and so the thing is is that there are two big costs when you're making these risks one is you've got the money and things like that but i think the biggest cost is time and so if you think about portfolio theory which is uh for example like
(02:00) venture capital vcs though let's say they take 50 companies on and they're betting the fact that one of those 50 companies is going to you know 100x and pretty much carry the return to the entire portfolio and for the vast majority of the other ones they will either go out of business or basically not really do anything spectacular and so for the vc for the venture capital the investor it makes sense to take this approach because they're going to get very good returns uh using you know you know using this this method whereas if
(02:24) you are one of the 49 you know founders who has pretty much all of their net worth invest in this thing and it takes five years of your life away to only fail it can be harder to swallow and so he and i have had very different careers and lives and it's because we we value risk differently now he would say that he is not interested in making money and he just wants to do something really big and really cool i tend to be more money focused uh or money money driven whatever you want to say because i think that the accumulation of money will
(02:50) allow me to do really cool things later on in my life and when i say later i mean like you know give me 20 30 years um of doing this and i think we can do that now the reason that i want to bring up this topic is because picking the business that you're going to go after i think is a very important question that you're going to ask yourself and you have to understand that you're probably going to fail many times before you are successful and one of the hardest questions in entrepreneurship and this is also one of the things that came up
(03:11) in the conversation is when do i push or when do i pivot right when do i keep pushing what do i keep persevering on this idea that's not quite working and when do i pivot and it's one of the hardest questions in entrepreneurship because you don't know whether it's you or the idea and that's what's hard because sometimes it's like how many great business ideas have the founders have abandoned six inches from gold where they just needed to push a little bit harder and they were going to have the breakthrough and i hesitate to talk
(03:33) about the subjects i think most people just don't know how to push at all and so you know i put that as a big caveat now when we're talking about business in general i and this is my difference from my friend i prefer to only go after ideas that i think have virtually no risk of not being ideas that people want which then leaves only me as the variable the execution risk that it can be done well it can be well businessed right and so i think in a lot of ways this is just alex's two cents most newer entrepreneurs i think would be better
(03:59) served going after boring businesses that have established needs right so people want to have you know businesses want more customers people want to make more money people want higher paying jobs people want to have skills that are valuable people want you know to lose weight people want entertainment like these are all things that are not going to change over time and so what that allows you to do is hone your skills at business because you know if it doesn't work it's only you it's only your fault if it doesn't work right and so because
(04:24) the problem is that having the perspective from which to make a judgment on whether you have product marketfit can be i think a much harder decision of when to push and when to pivot right and as a total side note because i think this is really interesting i think there's three big questions that are really dichotomies that um you have to manage as an entrepreneur right one is one to push in one to pivot the second is how much do i consume versus how much do i invest right because you're going to be living your whole life if you always forgo the
(04:46) immediate satisfaction you may reach the end of your life and never have enjoyed anything right so there's a little bit of a balance there that you have to strike right and it probably shifts over time but there still means that there's some level of consumption even early on in your life and at the same time you also don't know if you're gonna live tomorrow right and that's where it gets really interesting and uh it's a personal question right and the third is is kind of the balance between like how much do i you know delegate uh to other
(05:06) people versus how much do i do right because you gotta do something and you can delegate everything right like and so there's there's balances here and so today it's just about the the push and the pivot uh and idea risk versus execution risk and so for the newer entrepreneurs you probably suck at business and that's okay and that's because you're new which is totally reasonable totally acceptable and of course you should suck because it's hard and a lot of people do it right if you want to be in the top one percent it's
(05:26) one percent of people that means you have to beat 99 other people out of 100 in order to be the top one percent which is only 400 thousand a year right not only it's a lot of money right and so the thing is is that instagram makes everyone feel like if you're not making money lg you're poor which is not true you can save 400 000 a year for not that long and uh and have a lot of money you know what i mean and so anyways back to the point if you're picking businesses the difference that he and i had is that his mentors always went super super big
(05:48) they wanted to go change the world and whatnot but what i don't think we see or appropriately risk or value is the graveyard full of people who went big and struck out and i think is an interesting caveat to this jeff bezos gives this example and i want to dive into it in a little bit more detail let's let's zoom out for a second let's eliminate jeff bezos elon musk warren buffett from the names that you have in your head if we were to think what would be required to be number one in the world at a thing right you'd have to
(06:13) have the natural proclivity right because if you're competing against everybody the people who are gonna have natural advantages based on genetic code upbringing whatever are going to they're going to win more right so that'd be the first thing we'd want if we wanted to create this person who's going to be likely to win number two is they'd have to have a tremendous amount of skill right so they'd have the natural proclivity the the nurture that created an environment where they had work ethic to pursue the skill right so they have
(06:34) to be very very good and then third they'd have to be lucky right because if you think about a whole bunch of people like imagine everybody who's born really you know has his natural tendencies or proclivities towards these activities right and then does a ton of it in terms of volume so they get very good what then separates them luck right the people at the very very very top have all the all of the things aligned comma and luck and so it's interesting that he has this quote around risk um because one of the things that's unique about
(06:58) bezos and even elon right and this is probably a further discussion on business strategy overall is that they've had virtually limitless access to capital right like as in they can basically raise money endlessly to fund these risks right and so the equation that he said which is imagine you go to vegas casino and there's a there's a table that has a 10 chance of winning but you get 100 times payout when you do right if you can play the game on an unlimited time horizon then you absolutely should just play as played as
(07:26) many times as humanly possible right but most of us do not have unlimited spins right and that's where this gets more interesting and so if you were to imagine a dollar as a year of life okay that you have in your entrepreneurial career and let's say to build something really epic would take 10 years and that's like minimum you know what i mean like facebook was 20 is 20 years old now right which is kind of insane to think about i think it's 20 years old is it 20 years old i feel like it's 20 years old it's pretty old 15 years old it's pretty
(07:50) old right let's just say 15 right if you want to build something epic which means and how long does it take to test the idea before moving on right that's another big question like how long does it take to really give it your all on a thing and so we were having the discussion and he said i think we should say 35 would be you know you have 35 years of life and uh you know how long do we do we chunk and we agreed on five years as a mid-ground because it takes 15 to really you know see something all the way through if we said 15 was the
(08:16) chunk that didn't seem realistic because it doesn't take you 15 years to find out something doesn't work right um and so it's that about so we said five was the was the number you can come up with your own right and so a more realistic way to see this right would be uh you know you've got a one out of ten shot at 100 times payout but the minimum bet is five and you've got 35 bucks interesting right the conversation changes now let's say that you're now 15 years in let's say you bet three times you lost all three times which would be reasonable
(08:39) that would be expected that you'd lose three times you could even lose all three of the first times but now you're 15 years in and you have still no money huh how do you feel about yourself right how do you feel about your skill what's your reputation all these things kind of weigh in you know what i mean this is why i think this is a really interesting discussion and so i will give you my two cents because he and i disagree on these things because i have the perspective that all the people that i know the wealthiest in the world eliminate risk
(09:00) so that's what they do they control risk they they virtually eliminate they figure out ways to play the game in new ways where they cannot lose right i'll give you an example if the rock came out with a i'm trying to think of something he hasn't come out with because he came out with apparel and whatever let's say he came out with uh let's say he came over the book right let's say let's see the rock writes a book maybe he already has written a book i don't know and he writes a book what's the likelihood that
(09:20) it's not a bestseller virtually zero right it's virtually zero so he's basically limiting the risk because he controls another variable she has a massive audience right and you can build that deliberately and so when we think about these things the richest people that i know control risk and only play games where if they wait they win and my friend has not taken that approach and he's like hey i just want to go big or go home and the thing is is that he's gone home more than he's gone big and so i uh i will give you alex's two cents
(09:43) and you can choose to do what you want with it and i'll just explain my views on risk i tend to go with the highest likelihood bet and i tend to if i have two bets let's say one where i have a 10x payoff for a you know one out of two shots right which would be a two to one risk adjusted return all right if you're curious you just multiply the pay off by the the by the likelihood or if that's a 5x sorry i've messed that up but you get the idea you multiply the payoff by the percentage likelihood and if i had an
(10:08) equivalent risk adjuster return in another one but i had a higher likelihood of achieving it so if i had a 5x that i or a 6x that i thought i had a 4 out of 5 chance of getting versus a 10x that i had out of the math on it but whatever a one out of two shot at getting i would pick the the four out of five shot that had a lower upside that's me and i think part of that is because the games that are set up that way are usually going to be just execution risk businesses and i feel like i can i can pay that down in other ways right i can
(10:33) pay down that risk so i can virtually nothing's guaranteed but i can virtually guarantee the outcome and so my goal is to string as many of these virtually guaranteed upsides in my favor for a long enough period of time that i let compounding work because compounding on a long enough time horizon creates the outsize return and so the idea is how can i play how can i get as many w's in a row and as few ls as possible for a long enough time horizon so that i create the outside's return comma and get delivered pretty cool and and
(11:04) stress-free or not stress-free but like a pretty cool life along the way right now if we played the game the way that we talked about earlier where you have the 35 years that you can bet and you're three bets in you're 15 years in and you don't have anything that can be pretty hard hard on your ego hard reputation maybe you learn bad habits like there's a lot of things because you won't know especially if there's an idea risk that's at hand like is it me or was it the idea right and so for that reason i'm in favor of the significantly lower
(11:27) risk and he and i were you know talking back and forth he's like you know what i've observed from you is that you just you go for the sure thing and that's a hundred percent what i do that is i've always gone for the sure thing and then i just continue to try and trade up the upside of my sure things right so the first short thing you can have is a very high paying you know income job and then the next sure thing would be like if i were to quit a job i would make sure that i had more income for my side hustle probably where i believed it
(11:50) would be very reasonable for me to get that you know within a very short period of time so then i would you know make maybe that switch and then i would look at you know all the opportunities that existed and think okay what are these things uh on a risk-adjusted basis and this is again where people make it you know errors like just assume like you have to take the negative assumptions and i'd say like the the better i get at this at thinking this way the more i i continue to make which is i'm gonna assume everything goes wrong what then
(12:13) do i make right and so if you can just say like assuming none of the good things that you think are reasonable are going to happen happen can you still win and i think when you think that way what happens is you give yourself room to be pleasantly surprised and exceed expectations but what happens is when you set up the game that way where you're like i'm assuming these are the five things that i think will happen and will go right but i'm assuming none of them are gonna go right do i still win and if you can still win then that is an
(12:37) opportunity worth pursuing in my opinion and so that's um that has been the approach that i have taken which is how can i virtually eliminate downside risk how can i eliminate idea risk and how can i and when i say virtually eliminate downsides i meant to say the execution risk so how can i eliminate idea risk by only going after things that people i already know want and then how can i stack the chips in my favor like the rock where if i want to write a book i want to make sure it's a best seller no matter what right how do i do that and
(13:03) then think about all the things that can go wrong assume they go wrong and then think what would i do in order to still succeed even with all these things going wrong and then i think when you take those actions you may not hit the thousand x return but let's paint a different game that you could play so let's say you could play there's the two games one was the one that jeff bezos outlined right which you got uh you know one out of ten shot at getting 100 times payoff the game that i prefer to play is how can i get a 3x
(13:26) payoff with a 95 chance of certainty and i still have the same 35 right minimum bet well i'll bet 5 and get my 3 and then i'll bet my 15 i'll get it and i'll be at 45. and then i'll bet my 45 and i'll be at up there we go i'm already at 120 or whatever it's already got my 100 times payoff by thinking about it from a risk-adjusted basis now it's not going to be sexy it's not but if you double or triple or 5x things enough times you get to the 100x very quickly and you can do it with limited downside knowing that
(13:54) you've controlled for the idea risk and have only focused on the execution risk which is yourself and so that's how i've thought about risk with opportunity that i thought i would share with you because it was a really cool conversation um i hope i hope it gave you some light in terms of uh at least how i think of things um and maybe some of those ideas uh could serve you so mostly nation love you guys i don't deserve you but i love you for being as awesome as you are leave questions in the comments for uh for future vids they're really helpful

Transcript:
(00:00) So, it's July 16th, 2025. We are 30-ish days out almost to the day uh to the August 16th uh live launch. I wrote the book because I hadn't heard anyone talk or write anything about it at all. And I saw it as one of the most important things that you can put in a business. I am kneede um in just a bunch of different facets of the launch.
(00:27) So, it's funny because it's a, you know, it's a few hours for everyone who shows up, but it's like multiple years of preparation that we're doing. We're on the way to the airport, go meet Alex and Ila for a flight cuz content in the plane typically does better. So, I just grabbed basically every hook that's been working for the existing winners, plus a bunch of the organic ones that did well.
(00:55) Yeah. Yeah, I feel like it just got harder cuz they turn it off and they turn it back on. Oh, I thought it was I walked in then. Ain't easy being easy. So, you're good just witnessing ads. I was told I'm a big clipboard guy. I love wildly underrated. Everybody's like, "Let's go to AI." I'm like, "Let's print [ __ ] out and put it on a [ __ ] clipboard. You can write on it.
(01:22) You can hold it. You can pass it to someone. You can keep a couple sheets in there. Never forget that. You guys might want to wait to do ads until we take off. It's going to be loud as [ __ ] Yeah, Leila's been a sport, but being not bothered by me just doing ads and doing this BDS while she sits silently. Great. Yeah.
(01:42) What do you think about the launch? You think it's a good idea? I think what's more interesting is hearing what it's like to prepare for a launch that you know that many people are watching. I think that's more fascinating than hearing about the book itself. Should you change that? I don't even think people would believe it cuz like at the end of the day, I don't think entrepreneurs like we don't get a lot of, you know, honestly, we just get [ __ ] on most of the time.
(02:06) Like we get told we're bad people and so I wanted to make an event by us for us to help solve as many of those problems I possibly can in one day. Are you sleeping? No. No. No. I can tell you. Actually, I can tell you exactly how many hours I'm sleeping. I'll tell you my last foot in death's door.
(02:25) I know what I'm saying. Yeah. Sean says, "Old man reaper is knocking." Old man mosy. 5 hours and 45 minutes last night. 5 hours and 20 the night before. 5 hours and 17 the night before that. 7:45. That was Saturday. Yeah, that was on my birthday. Yeah, that was your birthday. Well, and I love you had this tweet that's like everyone's got battered like no one's playing 100%.
(02:47) Is it kind of like Yeah, no one's playing. People are like, "Oh, like like I didn't do I only slept five hours last." Like [ __ ] at the volume we're doing the ads, it sounds like it'll be Yeah. No red flags really. We're just on standby to see what data just says they're going to send us some data tomorrow.
(03:03) So there's a little more statistical significance. So then we'll turn around ad creative for both Wednesday's shoot and also the private jet ads on Friday. Yeah. I think one of the things that's really big, like I'll I'll I'll give you guys a little hint that I think is going to be our our dark horse of the the many small wins we've had up to this point.
(03:21) Yeah. All right, great. Fireworks. I'll see you guys. I wrote the book because I hadn't heard anyone talk or write anything about it at all. And I saw it as one of the most important things that you can put in a business. And so I wrote down everything I knew about it and decided to release it. A lot of business owners think that they need to change something about their business or get into a different business because they're not making as much as they think they should or want to. And a huge part of that is your
(04:00) actual money model. It's your monetization structure. How you collect money, how you charge for what you do. So I started writing money models in 2021. I had a mentor who told me that I should document like the artifact or the crystallized knowledge of that. I took that advice and I ended up writing just this massive tone that was 400 something pages and uh that's what became um all three of the $und00 million uh books and so many models is offering the right thing at the right time in the right way to the right customer. And that takes a
(04:33) little bit of practice but that's exactly why I wrote the book. right now there's just a lot of different pieces going on. It's like we've got inventory stuff going to warehouses. We've got um other surprise little bonuses that are also traveling around the world. And I enjoy this. Like this is the this is why most people don't do it and this is why most people don't win.
(04:54) But like I outline those details so that it's uh kind of clear like oh there's there's more than one thing that happens. It's not like Alex is just going to go on YouTube live and be like hey I have a new book. We're on our way to North Vegas to go to the warehouse. um Money Models book warehouse to check out inventory. Alex on the way there right now.
(05:12) So yeah, we'll see how it goes. What's up? Ready. Hi there. How's it going? Thank you so much. Appreciate it. Thanks for having us. Hello. Hello. How are y'all doing today? Good. So, what did you guys I guess for today? We want to make sure we hit what I know see some of the inventory on the couple pictures. I mean, we're hoping to do over a million copies. So, it's a lot of boxes.
(05:36) We're striving very, very aggressively to get all of the shipments out within 72 hours, which is just a herculean feat because I think we're going to pass all of the launch sales that we did last time before we even release the book this time. Yeah. All right. How many How many pallets do you guys have? I'm not going to ask you to take all the pallets down.
(05:56) I'm just I just want to have an understanding. Roughly about 80, I believe. I think we just take one pallet down and then we'll just film it and call it a day. Well, 240,000 divided by 3 is 80. There's 24 in a box. So, how many people will be here to like actually move the product? What's what's kind of the tenative plan for getting Cuz I mean, I do that math like, okay, 10 guys.
(06:22) I don't know what how many how many books a minute somebody can put out. Um, you would know that math better than me because last year we had 30 and they got [ __ ] hammered and I am five, this will be five times bigger than last year. Now this time we are distributing between three different warehouses across the US.
(06:41) That way we can get it to you guys faster. We have 300 plus support staff that are going to be here for the launch. We have installed uh really exceptional AI. It's just a lot. It's a lot because we have high standards. It really just comes down to that. It's a lot because we want it to be exceptional for everyone at any touch point, any surface area that you're exposed to at the brand.
(07:00) All right, so we're opening this bad boy up. Somebody's gonna get a a lucky uh a lucky copy. Our goal is to get 1,800 more of these pallets of books, and we're going to try and do it in 24 hours, which is absolutely absurd. So, like, we're we're here, and we haven't started promoting it yet. Yeah. At all. From that's an email. One email.
(07:20) It's one of those things that we can definitely box up if needed. So, no, I appreciate it. Thank you so much, Stephen. So, we just got out of the warehouse. Um, just double checking on numbers for pallets and books and what's going to get pre-kitted and making sure that they're staffed up so that they can uh handle the volume.
(07:36) Obviously, this is not all the locations. This is one of many. So, we'll have a meeting tomorrow and centralize with leadership and make sure that uh it's fully staffed so that we can uh accommodate it. But, there's always the unknown. So, thank you guys for all coming. I appreciate it. I'm Alex Shamoszi. That's where it starts. So, it's like I'm Alexi.
(07:57) This is my 100 million book launch. And then we like rock and roll, right? Yeah. Those ads are actually already done. Um, we finished the 40 or so that we filmed. What I'm going to do is I'm going to take the best hooks that are still that will still work. Yeah. The last couple. Great.
(08:15) So, last launch there was no um there was no offer to liquidate ad spend. Uh and so I just printed the money for the advertising. Um this one I'm demonstrating the concept of the book which is a money model. So basically how do you pull cash forward accelerate cash conversion uh within a business so that you can scale and so I want to demonstrate that with the launch. So that's what I'm doing.
(08:35) And so basically the goal is to spend as much money as humanly possible uh while maintaining break even or better. And the end result should be more good people knowing about it. So, this one should be bigger than the last one. We'll find out as long as ad accounts and, you know, all that stuff works the way, you know, we hope.
(08:54) If you're struggling to get as many customers as you want or it's costing you too much to get customers, rather than thinking, "Oh, I'm spending too much to get customers, do what you can control, make more from each one." And so, if you want the free event and the secret project, you only have to do one thing. Click the link, register.
(09:11) I'll see you there. Cool. Cut. I feel like that one's going to do what? Yeah, that crispy. I think it's possible to put a book in the hand of every entrepreneur in America. Books and experiences are the two things that really changed my life. The goal is to just have a really awesome experience for everyone in Mos Nation to come together and do entrepreneur things and do it for the greater good.
(09:38) Businesses rarely die of starvation. They often die of indigestion. Fundamentally, you need another way to attract customers. Your business isn't growing because you don't have a good enough money model. When was the last time you ever heard of a money model? Well, you probably haven't because no one's talking about it. So, we can say we got another green dude throwing a party. I like this, too.
(09:54) He's going to pop off. Come to the book launch August 16th. August 16th. Yeah. Well, hope to see you there. No, you bet. See, this is why we advertise. No one knows. We think We think we're so important. No one knows. And if you're watching right now and you didn't know, now you know. August 16th, the book comes out. It's going to be sick.

The Truth About Retiring At Age 31 - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahslH-8qoFY

Transcript:
(00:00) at this point in my life i have enough passive investments that i make multiple million dollars a year uh without doing much and over the last nine months i struggled mightily with this fact and it was because i had completely removed myself from the portfolio of businesses that we own which do about 85 million dollars a year in revenue what i want to talk about today is kind of what that nine to 12 month journey was for me kind of living in pseudo-retirement and the single thing that has gotten me out of it because i was candidly you know
(00:33) pretty depressed and i couldn't find a way out because i kept looking for the next goal post right the the second championship ring because the desire was that that ring would somehow make the first one more valuable you know at the time of this making you know we've now crossed about a nine figure net worth i'm 32 my wife's 29 and it's hard for people to to conceptualize this but like i really don't need anything like i need nothing as much as that has been the goal for a long time which didn't need nothing it
(01:03) also introduces a new variable of needing nothing which means that there is nothing for me to do what i want to walk through is the kind of single phrase that i've been repeating to myself over and over again and it has become the chorus in my mental dialogue to myself it's around work and so what i realized after pseudo retiring and not really being involved in the businesses and having them continue to grow and continue to pump out cash flow is that you know the first thing that god gave adam and i'm not religious but
(01:33) i think that there's there's power in this in this story the first thing that god gave gave adam was not eve it was a job it was work to do and as humans we wither without adequate challenge we are formed against something else right the hotter the fire the harder the steel as a person who desires to continually grow i had removed the challenges in my life and felt stagnated or stagnant as a result of no challenge i had to re-examine a lot of different pieces of my life which is why do i work and up to this point the reason that i
(02:13) worked was for the outcome it was for me to build up my net worth to create financial freedom to be able to have all the time to do the things i wanted to do but in so doing i removed the things that i actually wanted to do which was challenges which was work that i found meaningful with stakes that are real the single chorus that i continue to react to and i'll show you the background on my phone it's hard work that's it and i love this proverb in the bible i can't remember which one it is i think it's i can't remember i want to
(02:45) say 14 3. our work works on us more than we work on it that's a loose paraphrasing but that's how i like saying it is that your work works on you more than you work on it and so if i have the desire to grow i must work and the goal cannot be to stop working that is what most people say and i think it's because the word work still is has has terrible connotations in society the amount of people who are like man you won't have to work ever again like dear god that sounds horrible i just lived it i never want to do it
(03:15) again but hard work is work worth doing the fact that it's hard makes it worth it when you look back and when i look back at the times that i enjoyed most in our entrepreneurial journey was the struggle was the times of lacking was the times where the stakes were high and we had to perform anyways not because of the outside circumstances because of what it told me about myself we do not have values until they are tested you cannot say you are loyal until you have a way to cheat on your spouse and know that no one will catch
(03:52) you you cannot be honest until you have the ability to steal money and know that you will not be caught and then choose not to do it anyways and so to the same degree i cannot grow unless i have something to match the ability to conquer that i have now i can't hang up my my suit right my arms uh my weapons just yet and so what's interesting is that as i've shifted my course to this thing what a lot of people when i share it say oh yeah because if you work hard all the other things will follow i'm like no no no no you're missing it and i had to
(04:30) correct this in my own head because that's how i started it if i do the hard work the things will follow and that's the common thing like it's all about the process not perfection it's it's not about the outcome it's about the journey like everyone says this [ __ ] but deep down they still want the akka and i'm telling you removing the outcome truly has been the most liberating thing i've ever done and i i can't begin to tell you the joy that i am feeling in being truly present because the work is the goal the work is
(05:00) the goal doing a good job is the goal and so when i find myself at the gym sometimes i would write you know i did eight reps when it was really seven and a half but i'm like why the hard work is the goal if i went up or it went down from last week it's irrelevant how hard i chose to work is the goal when i'm editing a paragraph for my next book i'm like oh that's pretty good i'm like you know it can be better and then i remember hard work is the goal and so then i dive back in when i'm tired and i don't really feel like giving layla the
(05:34) emotional energy to be the husband that i know i should be or that rather i would like to be i remember the chorus hard work is the goal and so it gives me this renewed energy to not only be better but to be present and so i have the opportunity to work hard and that's really the thing is that now i'm seeking opportunities to work hard because the work is the goal right now everyone's trying to shy away society's trying to tell us you shouldn't work it's all about passive it's blah blah blah but work is the goal and when you make work
(06:12) the goal it allows the process itself to be meditative it allows the process to get you into flow and for most of us flow is some of the best feelings that we can have in our experience because we truly are in the moment and so we do not work or try our best so that we do not work hard so that we work hard period because hard work is who we are and this has been a credo that i have i'm just beginning to internalize and it has it is giving me more presence than i've ever had and it's amazing and i know that i will fall short of
(06:58) hard work but i will be damned if i do not try in the present moment to work hard and when i die if all anyone says is that [ __ ] worked hard i don't know what else i would want anyone to say because the outcome is irrelevant there's luck there's outside circumstances right there's plenty of things that can affect how well you do but if we can appraise our success based on how hard we worked and the work itself and only you know if you could have done better and if you chose not to and i'm telling you the more times i
(07:41) recite this chorus in the present moment where i have the opportunity to not to to finish and know that based on the standards of others it's excellent but not on my own it gives you this it takes the power back from the world and brings it in because i'm not allowing them to tell me how well i did i'm not allowing chance or luck or chaos or circumstance or outcome to dictate how well i did i know because the thing is is that that stuff is irrelevant the only actual thing that we can control is the work we do now the hard work the work that we know
(08:28) that energy by the way side note your ability to work itself is improvable you can increase your capacity to work and to work hard and to work well by working hard and working well and so the more work i do the more work i become capable of and it's [ __ ] awesome and so i'm telling you that i was so so driven by first the outcomes that others that that i wanted to have to impress other people and then i would say the second kind of phase or season of my life was creating outcomes that would impress me and i feel like the thing that i'm
(09:05) transitioning towards which this last 12 months has helped me make this transition and i'm sharing this with you because i've been to what most people consider the mountaintop right we crossed a nine figure net worth mind you i'm 2 000 times poorer than jeff bezos but i'm still probably wealthier than the guys on instagram who are flexing right i've been to the mountaintop and i can tell you that there's nothing there nothing you feel nothing so the same way you feel right now truly about the amount of money or the
(09:35) amount of outcomes that you have supposedly achieved up to this point everybody's achieved something these things will be no more meaningful to you the second ring does not somehow make the first more meaningful moving the goal post does not make the thing more meaningful which transitions me to the third chapter right the third season for me which is that the hard work itself is the goal and that's it and when i look at my wife and i think uh i'm just gonna say hi rather than saying hey sweetie what's going on how
(10:04) can i help right if just like it doesn't like it's just mental energy of just trying harder just and then once i try hard over and over again that will become the new baseline and then i will be able to try harder still and so it's been this repeated chorus in my mind when i'm at the gym when i'm talking to layla when i'm working on a project when i'm making these videos try and work hard work hard hard work is the goal and it feels amazing because there's nothing else because at the end of my life at least if i look back
(10:53) and i had two lives one life where i achieved everything that everybody thought i would know that i would feel the same way i do now which is not empty but just nothing i feel the same as i did when i had ten million dollars the same as i felt when i had one million dollars the same as i thought i had a hundred thousand dollars i felt the same but if i look back and i can see that consistently over time i worked to the limit of my capacity to work true and honest to myself and so like i said at the very beginning of this you only
(11:25) have the value if you have the opportunity to not exercise it and do it anyways so you cannot be loyal unless you have the opportunity to cheat and not get caught and then you don't do it that is when you have the gift of knowing and having evidence that you have loyalty and so if i desire the character trait of hard work and work ethic then the only way that i will be able to have that is to do work and know that i could work and stop and everyone else would be satisfied and i would have no negative status ramifications because most of us work to
(12:05) the point where we would have we we reversed the negative status offications that the outcome of the work delivers all right so you do stuff just enough that your boss says it's good you do stuff just good enough that your clients think it's good but that means that you have the opportunity to work harder to work better to make it for its own sake for the sake of the work and chose not to and so therefore you cannot say or claim that you know how to work hard you work just enough to escape the social negative consequences
(12:39) you are just loyal enough to not cheat on your wife because you know you get caught in the negative consequences outweigh it you are just honest enough that you won't steal because you don't want to get caught and if you are only truly motivated by the negative consequence then you do not have the value and so the value that i am trying to grow in myself is the ability to work and the beautiful thing about this is that i get to test this every [ __ ] day is that i can have work that is good enough that people will see it and think
(13:10) that's good stuff and i would know that it wasn't as good as i could have made it but i get that opportunity again tomorrow to try and raise the bar and that is what i am focused on in this season and so i love you all mozy nation appreciate you um keep being amazing and i'll see you guys in the next videos bye

5 UNTAPPED Industries that could make you a BILLIONAIRE - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) the number one question that i get right now on this channel is hey i'm thinking about starting a business what market should i go after for those who don't know me my name is doctor mosey i own acquisition.com so when we look at portfolio companies and we're trying to figure out what markets we want to go after because we know just like warren buffett said if you have a good entrepreneur and a bad market the market wins and if you've got a bad entrepreneur and a good market the market wins all right so the market that
(00:21) you pick a lot of times i have a huge determination on the level of success that you have right it is far more important to pick the right boat than how hard you row those are warren buffett quotes you can take those to the bank so top five industry i would be pursuing in 201 2022 that are coming up all right the first one um and believe that this is going to be unsurprising to you is all things that are associated with cryptos and ifts d5 web 3.
(00:44) 0 all the things that come as downstream ramifications of this new technology right it's booming and there's a lot of really cool applications that are going to come as a result of this so if you know this industry then that would be something that i would be looking at because even if you're okay you will be a player in a massively growing industry so you'll have a huge tailwind behind you the second believe it or not is cannabis right it's still trusted and the reason i also like it is that it's relatively recession proof right actually it's a
(01:11) pro recession thing when recessions happen alcohol and drug use goes up so this is something that's still like the market's so big it still hasn't been conquered yet there's still tons of growth to happen there there's still people it's just becoming mainstream it still hasn't been completely you know decriminalized in all the states etc and so cannabis would be something that i would be looking at uh for types of businesses that i would be looking at building the next one is e-learning so obviously this is a big
(01:35) favorite of mine uh and that's because i believe and you've probably heard me say this many times on the channel i think that formal education has failed many of us it is a it is an antiquated system that is built on general knowledge rather than specific knowledge and right now people want specific skills that they can use in the marketplace to make more money and so the e-learning industry is becoming increasingly fragmented i don't think that trend will decrease i think will only increase in its fragmentation it will be had it'll
(01:58) have more silos and more verticals with excellent teachers at the top of them teaching very niche down skills and so i think that if you have a niche skill the e-learning uh marketplace it's set in in general is something that i would be looking at uh investing in uh my time and effort and money etc all right and i walk this talk as we do with acquisition.
(02:18) com we invest in these types of businesses all right the the fourth and this is a huge one is remote living all right so remote living is everything that touches the consequence of the huge push of remote so more people are moving out of cities they're moving to have more space they're having at home offices this thing that i'm recording on is a mobile studio right like if you're a photographer build mobile studios tons of people want to be able to travel they want to they want to have studios from home tons and tons of business to be had
(02:44) there you don't even have to market there's so much demand for this type of stuff uh i mean and there's so many downstreams of that that's why zoom blew up um you know like uh there's just there's so many things with with with remote living the reason that home home decorations and home improvements has been booming is because people are spending more time at home so that's why people want bigger houses that's why there's been like all of this stuff is as a consequence of this trend which i don't think is going to decrease right
(03:07) and then finally you could consider this maybe a a a spin-off of the one above but i felt like it was different enough that it deserved its own thing which is warehousing logistics there is more need for shipping and stuff to be stored now than ever before and that trend will only increase as people want to stay at home right they want stuff shipped to them and the demand for people to be lazy is very very high our brains are wired to do as little effort as humanly possible and so anything that i see that that works in a trend of delivering
(03:37) something to someone faster with the least amount of effort uh and this is the value equation right high perceived likelihood and a dream outcome which is they just click something and it shows up those are things that i would be investing in because i believe that they will be the things that outperform the marketplace as whole and so if you can get into a market that has a tailwind then you're also going to make the most money and so as a reminder for those who are new to the channel there are four things that we look at in every market
(04:02) all right number one is is the market growing number two are the people easy to target number three is there a need for it are people in pain right do they not like the way things are currently this is a smiley face sorry there you go uh are do they not like the way things currently are and they have pain to be solved and finally finally do they have purchasing power and so i would look at one of these as the big buckets that that exist and then you find one or two steps down from this bucket you zero in on your niche that
(04:33) you can capture that is in this growing marketplace and you will have the chips stacked in your favor in terms of getting uh investment funding in terms of the amount of demand that will that will happen simply based on the fact that more people want this than there are suppliers of it and this is a simple supply and demand curve and we prefer to be on the things that have more demand and less supply then more supply and less demand all right and that is uh how i analyze this in terms of the things that i'm looking at that i think are
(04:59) going to be good big trends that that you can hop on if you're thinking about investing your time and effort into starting a new business so anyways mosey nation lots of love keep being awesome and i'll see you guys in the next video bye

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on everyone i've got a special uh presentation for you today this is gonna be a little bit more advanced stuff um and it's because i'm partially making this for my team uh on the marketing side so one of the things that i have found has been a consistent source of new marketing for us is understanding data and so i think some people are much better at telling stores than i am but i'm pretty decent at slicing data and so um the nice thing is that there's always new inferences that you can derive from
(00:25) data that you can make the same thing mean different things and so for example i'll give you some statistics that we have um that we've based entire campaigns around so uh one campaign that was our most successful campaign that we've ever run was a one year later campaign and so what that was was we took all of our clients that have been with us for over a year and measured all of their stats and measured their status from before they were with us until now a year later and showed the difference right and the the differences were crazy you know 250
(00:50) 000 500 000 or a million dollars here extra like there's just massive differences and so from that from that one you know measuring example there's so many different sub divisions of data that you can use right you can just say hey when your later average client is up this right that would be one way to do the data another way to do that would be like one year later our top twenty percent of clients have added over four hundred thousand dollars a year uh to their yearly revenue another one would be uh the bottom you know eighty percent or
(01:18) at this right um and so there's there's all these are like one in here's another way of doing it one in five gyms uh who's been with us over a year is at is over z right and so there's different variables that you can play with right one is the percentage of people right the next is the goal and then the next is the duration piece so you have these kind of three wheels that you can spin together uh to make really interesting statistics and you can and you can you can base so many campaigns around it like another campaign that we have
(01:47) that's launching soon is um we just we just measured one in 5.5 gyms is over a million dollar a year run rate for us right and so all these you know so for me it's easy because like you know other people are like seven figure j and blah blah blah and so for me i'm like well they're talking about it we're doing it right and so i can always position myself because most people don't even capture their own data anyway so they don't even know and it's usually because it's not good right they already know they don't
(02:12) have any million dollar gym so they don't need to go measure that right we do know it's a one in 5.5 that's 18 now if you're thinking about from marketing perspective would you think 18 percent of gyms that we work with are seven figure gems maybe i don't think that sounds as compelling as one in 5.
(02:27) 5 like really one in five like that's not that bad right and the thing is is you can also invert that and say all right but 4.5 out of 5.5 gyms hit this right so it's like i can play on the on the on the the desire that people have to win the lottery survivorship bias like that people think they're going to be the one right but i can also play on the inverse which is something that i like doing a lot which is i love playing on averages i love playing on medians um with data because it's like hey this is just what the normal person does
(02:54) right like and here's what's cool you can always say after you say an average that also means half of people are above this we're like wow well i consider myself above average so i'm going to be above that because everyone thinks they're above average right and so when you're clumping data together you can use those three wheels right wheel one is over what duration wheel two is what is the um what is the outcome um and then i literally can't even remember what the oh and then the percentage of clients that achieve that right so it's
(03:20) percentage of clients the outcome and then the time duration and so you have these wheels that you can mix and match and even when you say percentage of clients you can say percentage of clients you can say the top percentage the bottom percentage the median the average right um and you can also say one in right so there's different different ways you can also say the fractional version like one-fifth of right so all of these are that's just like that was just on the one wheel of um what percentage of clients right
(03:46) what percentage one-fifth one in however many the fractional amount the top percent is the bottom percentage so you can invert either one of those so one in five or four out of five right that would be the inversion the same stat and so when i'm using all of that like this is what i'm running through and this is what i've had a really hard time teaching my team which is why i'm making this right now um is that like this is what i'm running through what i'm thinking when i'm looking at like the the data they get back from customer
(04:09) support or excuse me customer success is like this they're like here's here's all the gyms that we have i'm like okay how can we say this differently how can we say this in a compelling way and make it a hook for our marketing right um and so that was that was all the examples i had for uh percentage of clients right now if we're talking uh time duration right so with time duration i'm like i'm gonna be thinking uh super long long long time away and here's what's cool about when you use long longer durations away if someone's been with you for a
(04:38) year the likelihood that they've succeeded is very high especially in education-based business so i i love pulling out the one year or two year later pieces because one it shows that people stay with me for a long time which means that i continually provide value right so that's social proof of continued value creation which i like a lot so boom when you have the long term duration it's great that's an advantage especially if you're an older player in the space having those one year two year later testimonials is something that no one
(05:01) else can show that you can show to also demonstrate your long-standingness in the space right but on top of that somebody's been with you for that long is going to usually have a very good outcome and so if i just say hey the people who've been with me for over a year average this that it's like wow that's crazy right and so the data will will give a very positive impression of what you're marketing right flip side um is that you can cut it at different different times right you can look at first week you can look at first 30 days
(05:29) you can look at first two months right and so the thing is is if you have this data on a regular basis uh you can you can time stamp this stuff and really you can slice it and find that the slice that you're like oh this is really good like for us like our average gym in the first uh i think this first 15 days not 15 days excuse me first two weeks just fifteen thousand five hundred all right uh an additional round that's the average which means half people get better than that right crazy and so um and i i give you
(05:55) the other stat earlier one in 5.5 gyms is a million dollar gym right and so i'm i can play with these you know with these numbers because i could have said 18 or i could have said with the percent of the the 15 500 i could say that's a what's the outcome right the outcome wheel could be what's the increase right if it was the increase it might be like the average person you know doubles what they do in revenue in the first 14 days that's a different way of saying it right um i don't know what i don't know what the actual number is because i
(06:23) don't have that one offhand but like that would be something that i'd be that's something i'd ask my team i'd be like hey figure out what the fraction is here is it a doubling is it a 1.5 x is it a 30 increase well 30 increase doesn't sound as good as 15 500 right so i'm going to say that one instead and so when we're talking about increases there's four ways you can show it one is a a percent increase which is this went up by x percent right the next is an absolute increase which is additional 15 500 right um the next would be uh
(06:54) the actual total number made which would be their revenue plus the increase boom right which would be different but similar right uh so you've got the the just the increase you've got the total amount made you've got the percentage increase you've got a relative increase which is one that i like which is what is 15 500 buy you right so 15 hundred might be like um i would have to look up industry averages but i'd say the you know maybe industry average for uh a micro gym rent might be let's say two thousand dollars a month so i'd say in the first
(07:26) 30 days the average gym in our program pays off three quarters or nine months of rent wow that sounds kind of interesting right like that's that's compelling that's unique right so hopefully you're following along with me you're like the three big wheels right wheel number one you've got is what's the outcome well wheel number two is the time duration and wheel number three is what percentage of clients you know achieve this outcome and so when you're playing with these three wheels and you're slicing the data
(07:53) all of these wheels have variables which is why you can slice data in so many different directions but for me this is usually what i will search for like this is what i will hunt for i will look for the piece of data that tells the story that that that the copy can't tell or it can reinforce the story that the copy tells and makes it far more compelling right now mind you you have to be absolutely compliant when you use numbers right which is one of the things i also like doing it because we track our stuff and most of our you
(08:22) know most people in our space don't because they're you know still figuring out how to you know market and figure out their business but the thing is most people don't track this stuff and so i have a huge advantage because i've been tracking this stuff for years right and on top of that we have we have pretty decent um metrics around this stuff especially around client success and so with that i can hunt and say okay let's look at uh new clients you know first first eight weeks right what's how much what's the increase in revenue okay
(08:49) and the thing is is everything i just talked about was one stat right i just talked about revenue i could use the same three wheels with time uh the customer outcome and then what percentage of them achieved it i could use those same three wheels with any of the stats i could use it with profit i could use it with revenue i could use it with churn i could use it with um i could even use it with growth percentage right i could use it with like there's there's so many different ways i can i can use those three wheels in my
(09:16) marketing but usually this will be the central core concept that i will make an entire campaign around right because at the end of the day there's only so many ways for me to say we make gyms more money right like i mean and the thing is at the end of the day everyone promises that so the question is how can i make um a different more unique promise and how can i make it more compelling and believable that they will achieve it right and so that's kind of why i use data as most of the times the central selling point that i have
(09:46) for any program that i sell now the good thing is is that and i've always done it that way because i'm usually when we're convicted because it's it's easy to have conviction in stats because those are what they are so i can have absolute conviction that this is what it is so take it or leave it these are the stats right like you can choose you know if i said my you know my weight loss program has an 87 success rate uh people hitting you know over 15 pounds then then like me even like how about this i'll say it even differently let's say
(10:14) let's say i had a let's say my success rate of people hitting over i have a i have a 70 success rate of people hitting over 12 pounds lost in the first six weeks with me right there's two variables that i'm playing actually three again which is what percentage of customers achieve x result right and i can change x result because i said what percentage customers achieve over over 30 pounds lost it'd be much smaller it'd only be like 10 right and sometimes it's worth saying the top 10 of our clients hit x i think
(10:42) it works better with business stuff but like in a weight loss scenario that would be that would be an example it's like i have this percentage of customers to achieve this percent and i can move these right until i find a sweet spot where i look in the data and i'm like huh 70 of our clients hit over 16 pounds lost that's pretty good right in this period of time and so now i can start marketing that because i have the data to support it and substantiate it right and so when i'm thinking about new hooks right here's a different one that i ran
(11:10) that crushed it for us which is i told you earlier about the 5.5 gyms one of 5.5 gyms is a million dollar gym here's another way you can do it with the time i didn't even get into the time duration one yet is that i can say one in uh every excuse me every x days x minutes x hours x weeks x months we achieve a y right and so i found out because i looked at our stats and i think the the last year we had done gosh i don't know it was like i honestly can't remember the number but i do remember the outcome it was um i think we created like 50 something
(11:45) uh seven-figure gyms in 2019 or 2020 something like that anyways point is is we created that many and i was like well there's 52 weeks in a year that means that one in every 7.7 days we create another seven-figure gym so that means every basically every week we're cranking out another seven-figure gym so it takes the idea of like this is how many of these outcomes we've had right so again in that weight loss example i could say how many people have we had lose you know 20 pounds right over you know over the last year and they
(12:17) might say you know we've had we've had we've had 200 people hit that i'd be like cool so we can say every two days another person crosses 20 pounds lost at my facility wow isn't that a different way of saying x percent of people hit this goal in experience right so there's there's these different ways of slicing it um and so i would implore you and this is also for my team that when we're when we're looking at what our main hook our main messaging that we're gonna wrap the whole campaign around um is let's look
(12:44) at the data right and let's think about the three wheels what's the outcome uh what percentage people hit it over what time duration and then play with all of them right with the time duration it's one in every how many days every how many minutes how many whatever is it is it over one year is it in the first 30 days in the first six weeks you know whatever like is that that's the time duration the customer i already said all the million ways of slicing the the outcome um and the percentage right and so hopefully that makes sense for you hope
(13:12) you found that valuable um they'll probably give you unlimited ways of slicing your own data but i'm telling you it's one of the most compelling things in the world because it's just true so i'll leave you with that keep being awesome that was a huge marketing hack that has made me a tremendous amount of money so use it and uh be fruitful bye

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video I want to talk to you about how to eliminate problems in your life without taking any action and as crazy as that may sound I think that what I will share with you may sound even crazier if you don't know who I am my name is Alex Mosey on acquisition.com it's a portfolio of companies that's over 100 million a year and this lovely dolphin background paintings because my wife I've been traveling a lot and we're in random airbnbs so that being said let's rock and roll so yesterday I was having a conversation with an old friend
(00:25) of mine and we have different beliefs around the topic of problems especially when it comes to The Human Condition and I went on somewhat of a rant about this topic and I figured I would encapsulate it here for you guys and so the problem that this individual was talking about was a lot of stuff that has to do with you know mental illness and mental health and I think that this is a an interesting topic because the entire like industry didn't even exist until a few hundred years ago and humans have existed for a long period of time one of
(00:54) the more interesting things about the mental quote illness category is the importance of label and if you followed me for any period of time you'll know that labeling to me is one of the strongest powers that exists in the mind and I'll give you a reason why our minds are meaning making machines and so what that means is we determine what is Meaningful and what is not and then we ascribe labels to them in terms of positive and negative because that is how we survive now that being said our brains Are Meant To Keep Us Alive not
(01:26) meant to help us Thrive right to use a rhyming word for you now that being said with this whole concept around labeling it's something that I'm probably most passionate about like the concept of labeling as a whole it's unbelievably powerful when it comes to persuading people to do things unbelievably powerful when it comes to changing people's World Views and their perspectives on life and I will share a few of those examples with you so I'll give you a quick persuasion example for how powerful this is if I wanted to
(01:52) persuade someone to do something then what I would do is I would create a positive label that I would associate them with so I would say you are probably a loving and caring man and for you know you want to provide support for your family is that true they're like yes and I'm like yeah you definitely seem like one of those types of people and since you are one of those types of people I think that you should invest in this program that we have because that would be in alignment with this ideal that we just labeled the person with and
(02:16) so what happens is it creates cognitive dissonance because for the person in order for them to stay in accordance with the label that they would like to have they then feel obligated to then act in accordance with that label that we just uh prescribed now that's a very simplistic example you can weave that into narratives and sales scripts so that people become psychologically labeled and then want to act in accordance with that label because they see it as positive right the thing is is that it can also work in Reverse in
(02:41) terms of how you can harm someone and the reason that this is so viscerally upsetting to me is that I have had members of my family extended and whatnot who have I would say debilitated themselves in large part because of what they believe to be mental illness and I disagree now many people will get triggered at this and so I will say my big disclaimer which is this is not Financial advice this is not grammatical advice this is not spiritual advice this is not even advice this is a guy making a YouTube video about stuff that pisses
(03:07) me off and hopefully some of the things that serve me well now let's talk about the labels that are negative one of the things one of the most pernicious acts that exists negative bad stuff is when we take the human experience that has ups and downs that has extremes that exist on continuums and we label one side of the Continuum is bad and the other side of the Continuum is good for example happy sad energized or weak tired right we have equal opposites they're you know relaxed stressed right there's lots of examples of these the
(03:38) reason that this is so dangerous when we give a positive or negative label is that people think that they have a problem when they are not feeling happy or energized work relaxed or clear-minded versus foggy you you know what I mean whatever and the thing is is in order for there to be light there must be Darkness think about that for us second in order for there to be good there must also be bad one if you want to admit the existence of one there must also be the existence of the other right awesome now the problem this is
(04:14) why we have to be careful with labels that most people suffer from is that they label normal variations in The Human Condition with negative experiences and so they see themselves as tired and say this is bad whereas it's really just part of the human condition they see themselves as sad rather than happy and see that as bad and so what happens is you start to upgrade a finite emotional condition into a long-standing emotional disturbance because you think it's a problem and the thing is it's very easy to sell people on why these things are
(04:46) problems big Pharma is is the king of this are you feeling tired stressed you know are you hungry are you horny well you are suffering from being a human being it's being human and so I think a lot of this and the reason that it wraps into the original part of the prompt of this video is that if we want to be enduring entrepreneurs we want to be people who have resilience we want to people who have men fortitude we must be careful about the things that we label and there's also the good bad label which is the simplest label that a lot
(05:18) of people ascribe to conditions that are that are ephemeral right they're they're brief right and then they change but there's also the shoulds have must need to Etc that we say in our lives that we have to do these things or we must do these things and if we do not or else we put out a threat towards the universe if I don't get my coffee I must get my coffee I need to have coffee before I start my day what happens is that we create these implied threats to ourselves in the universe if we don't then what right and so I see this and
(05:52) this is probably the number one thing that people when I'm having conversations with them it's teaching yourself to listen for these language patterns because they are indications of in my opinion broken thought patterns people ascribe positive and negatives two things without understanding what the Deep ramifications of those things are and so if you are unhappy awesome you're human this is the human existence if you are tired awesome it will create more contrast for when you are awake if you are stressed amazing it will give
(06:28) you contrast for when you are relaxed if we constantly want to eliminate one side of the Continuum what often happens is that we get neither side and we become numb to the Continuum as a whole and so we end up missing out on some of the human experience and that's okay if that's what you want to do but the reason I'm making this video is that a lot of people think they have problems that are not actually problems at all they're just part of being human and I think the biggest problem that most people have is that they Define Being
(06:54) Human as the problem which inherently is why they suffer so much and I'll say something else that was pissing this person off yesterday that I will I will reinforce with you which is suffering is optional and an easy uh story to to to reinforce this foreign stream example of this is you if you've read a Victor Frankel's man search for meaning and it's a very visceral description if you haven't read it of uh of Auschwitz in the in the prison camps uh during World War II he basically posits in the book and this is a one-line summary that's
(07:24) doing a massive distrust uh uh Injustice to the book that between circumstance and response is choice and that is the power that all of us have even when he was stripped of everything that he possibly could have he still had choice and so in that Gap is where I believe we find The Human Experience we find how we Define how we choose to live it drives me up a wall because I feel like a lot of people suffer because they feel like the way that they are living is somehow wrong or bad or non-optimal or they need
(07:54) to take a pill or an injection to solve Being Human and I think if we can simply change our expectations about what Being Human really means and I say this passionately because I very much suffered from this for a very long period of time I was obsessed with being happy and in being obsessed with being happy anytime I was not happy I saw it as bad rather than a part of being human and I drove myself nuts I think I made myself more unhappy now I say this now not as though the being more unhappy is bad or good but I think that most people
(08:27) want to decrease their emotional disturbances that they experience right and so I think a key to not suffering is a understanding that The Human Experience has Peaks and troughs and it is normal and it is okay and as a side note one of the strongest mental health things that I did for myself that I'll share with you things that work for me is that I created a mental refrain it's just a simple thing that I can say to myself in my mind over and over and over again is that when I'm experiencing a negative quotes here negative part of
(08:57) The Human Experience I'll say and that's okay that's all be like I'm really annoyed right now I'll be like and that's okay rather than then casting judgment on the emotion because a lot of times you don't have control over your emotions but you do have control over the Judgment with which you apply apply to the emotion that you experience and the response that you have as a result and so I think this is where power is formed as humans is that some people two people are exposed to the same stimulus right same circumstances and one person
(09:26) perseveres and the other person does not then a lot of it is because of the choices that we make between circumstance and response and that's kind of back to Victor Frankel's thing I'll wrap off this this this final little thing here this rant with a quote from I think it was I think it's Socrates you said wisdom begins with a definition of terms and so most arguments or disagreements can be resolved if both people come to an agreement on terms and it's because we say things like happy we say things like healthy we say things like wealthy we
(09:59) say things like success right and we haven't defined the terms yet and then two people will have different definitions of what those terms mean or more likely non-existent definitions because they've never even thought about it right some amorphous word that they throw out bucket some general ideas and disagree but they have very different definitions of those things and the way that you define the outcomes that you want to experience will help you achieve them if that is what you so desire and I think that there's a tremendous amount
(10:30) of wisdom in that concept because you know in Socrates is quote because like for example when we sold our three of the companies that we sold last year right Jim wants Prestige labs in Allen we sold those to different buyers and what was interesting to me was when I read through the contracts the first half of like 50 plus page contracts were just defining the terms and I thought that was just so interesting that in order to come to an agreement we must first agree on terms right what is the scope or territory of a non-compete and
(11:00) then there would be a paragraph and then that word non-compete would be put somewhere else and the actual agreements themselves oftentimes are very simplistic it's like party a as defined by know appendix one agrees to sell right cell being defined in you know in appendix two to party B right as defined by said assets said assets to find it you know I mean and so what happens is when you become clear about the words you say you can communicate and think more clearly and a lot of times I think that this resolves a lot of the
(11:32) emotional disturbances that we experience as humans because we realize that they were never problems to begin with only that we Define them that way and therein by the problem of how we experience them and so this is something I'm very very passionate about hopefully the topic was not as amorphous as hopefully it sounded to you but people suffer because they choose to Define their experience as suffering and I think that many of us can experience fewer emotional disturbances or not upgrade them to long-standing emotional
(12:01) disturbances by simply saying a I'm experiencing this emotion which will pass comma and it's okay and B subset this is part of being human and then what happens is we could start redefining what The Human Experience should be and if we say for example that experiencing the full spectrum of The Human Experience is a life well lived and we desire to have a life well lived then we are doing a good thing when we suffer when we are sad when we are stressed because we are living our life to both extremes at different times in different
(12:35) seasons to the fullest degree so that we can look back on our lives and say I was a human being I lived this life and anyways these are things that keep me up when I think about what it means to be human and I think Buddha uh had a really interesting concept around this which is you know he talks about the middle path um in life which is by the way a lot of people don't know this but you know Buddha was a prince beforehand so he had all the riches he had all the Comforts right and then he went to extreme poverty on the other side of the
(13:00) spectrum and he was like the middle path right so it's understanding both sides of the human experience and not saying either one is good or bad but they just are and then I think when we do that we we remove the Judgment of self which is where a lot of the suffering occurs rather than simply being present for the experience and enjoying it for what it is which is just being human and we don't fall prey to The Narrative of the big pharmas that say that being human is wrong being human is bad experiencing emotions is not normal it's the most
(13:31) normal thing it's the most normal thing for people to be unhappy sometimes it's the most normal thing for people to be tired sometimes it's normal to be hungry it's normal to be horny it is part of being human and we create so much suffering for ourselves by saying that there is a problem with simply existing during a period of time on a Continuum and then that problem that we label then becomes long-standing rather than something that passes with time so lots of love everyone Mosey Nation appreciates you if you're

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video i want to talk to you about the tax strategies of the ultra wealthy and as someone who is ultra wealthy i find it ironic that the vast majority of videos that i see on youtube are made by people who are not ultra wealthy talking about how the ultra wealthy do things when they have no transparency into what those actions actually are [Music] i have gone through i've spent probably 750 000 on different tax advisors different tax strategies to try and figure out at least the u.
(00:25) s system to you know minimize tax drag and uh the conclusions that i have are somewhat simple and i want to share this with you so i can hopefully help you avoid a lot of the headaches and pain that i had to go through in this process and for context in the last three years i've spent 18 million dollars or i've paid 18 million dollars in taxes to the us government and happily done so uncle sam but what i want to do is rather than talk about the little itty bitty hacks i want to shift your perspective around them because um as i've looked into many many many of
(00:54) these things that are touted as tax strategies most of the times they are they are just tiny little bbs that do not make a significant difference and so if i can shift your perspective around this and get you to think the way the ultra wealth you think about taxes then i think that will make a bigger difference in your life than anything else will right off the bat the first thing is where you live is going to make uh you know the biggest initial difference and so first off in the u.
(01:14) s at a state level where you live is going to you know you can have a zero tax day versus you know california is a 15 or 16 tax date plus all the other taxes they tack on everything else you do and so you know the first and obvious thing to do is you can live into live in a lower tax state now the second level of this is what country you live in and so if you are a u.
(01:34) s resident you you suffer from uh global taxation meaning it doesn't matter where you live they're going to tax you and so there's only two ways to get around federal tax the first is to live in puerto rico six months of the year and export services from puerto rico if that is you you can do that it's a four percent federal tax rate so you can have zero percent state four percent federal and live there it's 100 legit it is legal to do that the other way to do it is to expatriate meaning you stop becoming a us resident you renounce your
(02:00) citizenship um as a u.s citizen and then you come back basically as an alien the way that you do that is you can become a citizen by investment you spend a million dollars uh in investment uh into the us and then you get basically a golden visa which means you pay for it and again though you have to be here less than you know six months of the year otherwise you then become a u.
(02:18) s tax resident again even if you're uh not a us uh citizen so the the big conclusion here is in the beginning you know get out of the states that are you know the high tax states move to a state that is lower tax but what i want to do is shift your perspective around this overall big picture because if you look at how your wealth will compound and again this is why i said this is tax strategies of the ultra wealthy the vast majority of your net worth is going to come from growth not the contributions okay and so if you
(02:45) plug your money into or what your what your retirement calculator you can google when they're all over the place you'll be able to see that the vast majority of your net worth over time is going to come from the growth of the assets that are in it not from the contributions and it comes mostly from starting early and so that is why i'm such a big proponent of living on absolutely nothing for as long as humanly possible so that you can so you can start using the compounding interest of time to your advantage and for perspective for everyone who's
(03:10) listening to this don't think right now i can only put 500 a month aside it's not going to make a big difference the thing is is that 500 a month when you are 20 will make a bigger difference than 5 000 a month when you are 45. so think about that for perspective all right the dollars now count 10 times more than the dollars in 10 years and so forth okay so that's number one the second thing that the ultra wealthy do in terms of uh tax considerations is that they think differently about how they buy so for example if i buy something that's
(03:38) worth a hundred dollars for thirty dollars i instantly tripled my money except i didn't pay tax on that tripling right because the value of what i purchased is worth three times more than what i paid for it but the beauty of this is that i get that gain without having to pay taxes on it and then it continues to grow and compound again without taxation and so the vast majority of much wealthy people understand this and they and they structure their life and their investments in that way which leads me to the third thing which
(04:01) is how slash if you sell so the only reason that the the tax rate is going to matter to you is if you pay capital gains and that means that you've chosen to sell but there are a lot of strategies around buying and holding you look at warren buffett he's held he's held seized candy for how you know 30 something years or 40 something years same thing with coca-cola right same thing with geico he continues to buy things and hold them because he realizes that the tax treatment is going to be so efficient if you buy
(04:28) correctly and so the goal is to think from the perspective of not i'm going to buy it and try and flip this i'm going to hold this for five years or this company looks good for this month is do i think that this thing is going to last for a very long time and if so i will get disproportionate returns by buying safe and buying something that's going to be here in 30 years then trying to buy something sexy now and so if you can understand that then you buy things to hold them for the long term because the biggest shift in perspective
(04:51) the ultra wealthy have versus the not wealthy is that they think in longer time horizons they think about generational wealth they don't think about what i'm going to pay for this month how can buy a car or whatever the fancy stuff that leads naturally to the fancy stuff which is like well if i'm buying all these things how am i going to live my life later good question well the cool thing about how the u.
(05:09) s tax code works is that loans are never treated as income but they are spendable money that you can consume and use and so for example if i continue to plow all of my money into assets that earn while i sleep which is the definition of wealth that i gave you one of my other videos if they continue to grow and they are growing tax-free then the growth that is tax-free i can i can realize by taking loans against those things and i can use those loans to live my life and as long as the loans that i'm taking are less than the growth of my assets
(05:37) then i can use all of that growth continue to let it compound tax free for the rest of my life and live off the loans and when i dab they can they can rectify my account and so these are the strategies of the people who are ultra wealthy the things when they talk about conservation easements which is uh basically you donate land and you get the full value of the land even though you didn't pay the full value it's it's a bb right you're not going to be able to put your entire income against that uh you know captive insurance i've got a
(06:01) friend of mine who was like dude do this thing with me and say and for me it ended up it was going to save like 250 thousand a year which honestly doesn't make a big dent for me and it wasn't really worth the hassle so i was like i don't know this was a little fishy guess what happened the irs ended up flipping the their rule ruling on it saw people taking advantage of it and then they back back charge people with interest and fees right and so the thing is is that the us tax code is not fair because the government can change the rules whenever
(06:25) they want they can say you know what we changed this rule this year and we're going to back text people three years they can do that because they have complete control there's nothing we can do about it right i like to think about it just like i think about content on any kind of platform is that i just have to align within the rules that that exist and long term if i don't sell anything i'm not going to get taxed on it and so the idea long term is live for less than i you know for as low as i possibly can if you like island
(06:49) living then by all means go and live on an island if you if you so choose for me i've chosen not to do the puerto rico thing because the difference in net worth for me makes no difference in my life because the difference between having a hundred million dollars and 180 million dollars to me makes no difference and so i got into this game because i wanted to have used money to have freedom to do x y z right to live where i wanted to live to do what i wanted to do with whom i wanted to do it right and so if that is the goal of what the
(07:17) money is going to afford me i can't put the money above the freedom and so if i have to remain prisoner of an island for six months of the year in order to get my a better income tax rate right then it seems like it's putting the cart before the horse for me it's i'm i'm relinquishing the original objective i had and making the path or the vehicle the objective rather than realizing that money in it of itself has no value it only has value in so far as it allows me to do things that i want to do and so if i'm forgetting that which many
(07:43) of us do because the game is so enticing then i think that that is what makes that more uh reasonable a lot of people end up rationalizing no you know i love island living but i'll tell you what the reason that they give you that four percent is because it's not that sick so for me i think the easy thing me living in texas versus california the the living lifestyle is the same for me uh but i but i pay less fewer taxes worth it makes sense to me living in puerto rico i'm relinquishing a lot of freedoms there and i have to be there six plus
(08:09) months of the year and for me that's very difficult with outages and and basically no stores that are interesting and not a lot to do i'm not going to give up the half of my life literally um so that i can get half more money on my net worth because as much as people are like well that 40 is going to compound well so is the other 60.
(08:26) and so again i think it makes sense if you are if you were smaller and you were starting out and you're trying to develop your net worth but i can tell you right now the vast majority of your worth is going to come from the growth and none of that has to be taxed and so if you play the game the right way which is the way the ultra wealthy play they're not trying to think about all these little hacks and codes that you see on the internet here it's really about making sure that you understand the big rocks correctly which is
(08:45) buy low immediately get value on your money for buying for less than what something's worth when you sell it or don't sell it at all you can continue to take loans against the increased value of the assets and you can live off this rest of your life if you so choose and so these are the tax strategies of the ultra wealthy from someone who actually is ultra wealthy i hope you found value in this video click subscribe and i'll see you in the next bit bye

(00:00) in this video i want to talk to you about the tax strategies of the ultra wealthy and as someone who is ultra wealthy i find it ironic that the vast majority of videos that i see on youtube are made by people who are not ultra wealthy talking about how the ultra wealthy do things when they have no transparency into what those actions actually are [Music] i have gone through i've spent probably 750 000 on different tax advisors different tax strategies to try and figure out at least the u.
(00:25) s system to you know minimize tax drag and uh the conclusions that i have are somewhat simple and i want to share this with you so i can hopefully help you avoid a lot of the headaches and pain that i had to go through in this process and for context in the last three years i've spent 18 million dollars or i've paid 18 million dollars in taxes to the us government and happily done so uncle sam but what i want to do is rather than talk about the little itty bitty hacks i want to shift your perspective around them because um as i've looked into many many many of
(00:54) these things that are touted as tax strategies most of the times they are they are just tiny little bbs that do not make a significant difference and so if i can shift your perspective around this and get you to think the way the ultra wealth you think about taxes then i think that will make a bigger difference in your life than anything else will right off the bat the first thing is where you live is going to make uh you know the biggest initial difference and so first off in the u.
(01:14) s at a state level where you live is going to you know you can have a zero tax day versus you know california is a 15 or 16 tax date plus all the other taxes they tack on everything else you do and so you know the first and obvious thing to do is you can live into live in a lower tax state now the second level of this is what country you live in and so if you are a u.
(01:34) s resident you you suffer from uh global taxation meaning it doesn't matter where you live they're going to tax you and so there's only two ways to get around federal tax the first is to live in puerto rico six months of the year and export services from puerto rico if that is you you can do that it's a four percent federal tax rate so you can have zero percent state four percent federal and live there it's 100 legit it is legal to do that the other way to do it is to expatriate meaning you stop becoming a us resident you renounce your
(02:00) citizenship um as a u.s citizen and then you come back basically as an alien the way that you do that is you can become a citizen by investment you spend a million dollars uh in investment uh into the us and then you get basically a golden visa which means you pay for it and again though you have to be here less than you know six months of the year otherwise you then become a u.
(02:18) s tax resident again even if you're uh not a us uh citizen so the the big conclusion here is in the beginning you know get out of the states that are you know the high tax states move to a state that is lower tax but what i want to do is shift your perspective around this overall big picture because if you look at how your wealth will compound and again this is why i said this is tax strategies of the ultra wealthy the vast majority of your net worth is going to come from growth not the contributions okay and so if you
(02:45) plug your money into or what your what your retirement calculator you can google when they're all over the place you'll be able to see that the vast majority of your net worth over time is going to come from the growth of the assets that are in it not from the contributions and it comes mostly from starting early and so that is why i'm such a big proponent of living on absolutely nothing for as long as humanly possible so that you can so you can start using the compounding interest of time to your advantage and for perspective for everyone who's
(03:10) listening to this don't think right now i can only put 500 a month aside it's not going to make a big difference the thing is is that 500 a month when you are 20 will make a bigger difference than 5 000 a month when you are 45. so think about that for perspective all right the dollars now count 10 times more than the dollars in 10 years and so forth okay so that's number one the second thing that the ultra wealthy do in terms of uh tax considerations is that they think differently about how they buy so for example if i buy something that's
(03:38) worth a hundred dollars for thirty dollars i instantly tripled my money except i didn't pay tax on that tripling right because the value of what i purchased is worth three times more than what i paid for it but the beauty of this is that i get that gain without having to pay taxes on it and then it continues to grow and compound again without taxation and so the vast majority of much wealthy people understand this and they and they structure their life and their investments in that way which leads me to the third thing which
(04:01) is how slash if you sell so the only reason that the the tax rate is going to matter to you is if you pay capital gains and that means that you've chosen to sell but there are a lot of strategies around buying and holding you look at warren buffett he's held he's held seized candy for how you know 30 something years or 40 something years same thing with coca-cola right same thing with geico he continues to buy things and hold them because he realizes that the tax treatment is going to be so efficient if you buy
(04:28) correctly and so the goal is to think from the perspective of not i'm going to buy it and try and flip this i'm going to hold this for five years or this company looks good for this month is do i think that this thing is going to last for a very long time and if so i will get disproportionate returns by buying safe and buying something that's going to be here in 30 years then trying to buy something sexy now and so if you can understand that then you buy things to hold them for the long term because the biggest shift in perspective
(04:51) the ultra wealthy have versus the not wealthy is that they think in longer time horizons they think about generational wealth they don't think about what i'm going to pay for this month how can buy a car or whatever the fancy stuff that leads naturally to the fancy stuff which is like well if i'm buying all these things how am i going to live my life later good question well the cool thing about how the u.
(05:09) s tax code works is that loans are never treated as income but they are spendable money that you can consume and use and so for example if i continue to plow all of my money into assets that earn while i sleep which is the definition of wealth that i gave you one of my other videos if they continue to grow and they are growing tax-free then the growth that is tax-free i can i can realize by taking loans against those things and i can use those loans to live my life and as long as the loans that i'm taking are less than the growth of my assets
(05:37) then i can use all of that growth continue to let it compound tax free for the rest of my life and live off the loans and when i dab they can they can rectify my account and so these are the strategies of the people who are ultra wealthy the things when they talk about conservation easements which is uh basically you donate land and you get the full value of the land even though you didn't pay the full value it's it's a bb right you're not going to be able to put your entire income against that uh you know captive insurance i've got a
(06:01) friend of mine who was like dude do this thing with me and say and for me it ended up it was going to save like 250 thousand a year which honestly doesn't make a big dent for me and it wasn't really worth the hassle so i was like i don't know this was a little fishy guess what happened the irs ended up flipping the their rule ruling on it saw people taking advantage of it and then they back back charge people with interest and fees right and so the thing is is that the us tax code is not fair because the government can change the rules whenever
(06:25) they want they can say you know what we changed this rule this year and we're going to back text people three years they can do that because they have complete control there's nothing we can do about it right i like to think about it just like i think about content on any kind of platform is that i just have to align within the rules that that exist and long term if i don't sell anything i'm not going to get taxed on it and so the idea long term is live for less than i you know for as low as i possibly can if you like island
(06:49) living then by all means go and live on an island if you if you so choose for me i've chosen not to do the puerto rico thing because the difference in net worth for me makes no difference in my life because the difference between having a hundred million dollars and 180 million dollars to me makes no difference and so i got into this game because i wanted to have used money to have freedom to do x y z right to live where i wanted to live to do what i wanted to do with whom i wanted to do it right and so if that is the goal of what the
(07:17) money is going to afford me i can't put the money above the freedom and so if i have to remain prisoner of an island for six months of the year in order to get my a better income tax rate right then it seems like it's putting the cart before the horse for me it's i'm i'm relinquishing the original objective i had and making the path or the vehicle the objective rather than realizing that money in it of itself has no value it only has value in so far as it allows me to do things that i want to do and so if i'm forgetting that which many
(07:43) of us do because the game is so enticing then i think that that is what makes that more uh reasonable a lot of people end up rationalizing no you know i love island living but i'll tell you what the reason that they give you that four percent is because it's not that sick so for me i think the easy thing me living in texas versus california the the living lifestyle is the same for me uh but i but i pay less fewer taxes worth it makes sense to me living in puerto rico i'm relinquishing a lot of freedoms there and i have to be there six plus
(08:09) months of the year and for me that's very difficult with outages and and basically no stores that are interesting and not a lot to do i'm not going to give up the half of my life literally um so that i can get half more money on my net worth because as much as people are like well that 40 is going to compound well so is the other 60.
(08:26) and so again i think it makes sense if you are if you were smaller and you were starting out and you're trying to develop your net worth but i can tell you right now the vast majority of your worth is going to come from the growth and none of that has to be taxed and so if you play the game the right way which is the way the ultra wealthy play they're not trying to think about all these little hacks and codes that you see on the internet here it's really about making sure that you understand the big rocks correctly which is
(08:45) buy low immediately get value on your money for buying for less than what something's worth when you sell it or don't sell it at all you can continue to take loans against the increased value of the assets and you can live off this rest of your life if you so choose and so these are the tax strategies of the ultra wealthy from someone who actually is ultra wealthy i hope you found value in this video click subscribe and i'll see you in the next bit bye

How I CRUSH copycats, thieves and competition. - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGup9yYrOoc

Transcript:
(00:02) over the last five years i've had 22 different clients and or employees try and repurpose you know our licensing material into their own business and um i wanted to make this video to talk about how to handle that as you inevitably grow in business this is going to happen to you so it's a matter of when not if and what i think have been some of the best strategies that i've that i've used to deal with them so by the way fyi my name's alex from rosie i own acquisition.
(00:35) com we do about 85 million a year in revenue so today i want to talk about uh kind of the the backlash against competition and copycats and things like that so the biggest problem that most entrepreneurs deal with or at least that i was dealing with uh each time especially earlier on when this would happen is that i took it as such a great deep personal affront as in it was a it was a true attack on my character i was like how could you be this way i thought that they were scum and all the many things and thoughts that we you know would naturally go
(01:07) through but i had a mentor early on in my life and she shared something with me that i've always it's always stuck with me and she said you'll become astonishingly good at predicting the behavior of others if you always assume they will act in their own best interest and that has been incredibly telling and so instead of listening to what people say and uh and believing them if you just simply can think what is in this person's own best interest independent of myself or anything that i am you know basically take yourself out of the
(01:36) equation and think from their perspective you will become astonishingly good at predicting what people are going to do right and so the idea if you want to get people to do what you want them to do is that you must align what is in their best interest and what is in your best interest together and if you can do that and accomplish that effectively then you will be able to harness people's selfish nature towards a common goal which is ultimately what a lot of business really is right so back to the story 22 different people have tried to take
(02:07) our stuff repurpose our stuff and it's not just taking it and repurposing it it's typically also uh additionally them talking right about you um and usually soliciting uh other employees or current clients of yours to go with them right and so that then creates even more anger because it feels like someone's taking your stuff etc but this is what i can tell you has happened um in the few instances uh that i did earlier on my career where i focused a ton of time and effort on these people um i even one time dramatically changed
(02:45) my business model in response to uh somebody who was trying to solicit my best clients and my current clients and start a business adjacent to me the only thing that happened was that i just hurt my own business and the reality is the vast majority of my customers had no idea any of this was happening at all it was all happening in my own head and i was magnifying it way out of blowing it out way out of proportion right and so if you're in this situation these are some of the things that i think through or that i think with
(03:17) to help myself feel better about it number one they need me i do not need them i am the source of the thing that they are trying to copy and therefore they will always be a subset of me which means they cannot be bigger than me if the source of everything they have is me right if their source of customers is my customer base if the source of their of their business model is my business model they need me i do not need them right right so that's number one number two the type of person who operates in this way admits that they are a follower and not
(03:50) a leader all right which means that they cannot lead you it's a different way of saying the first one but i think it's worth mentioning right number three the type of person who operates in this way will always operate from a place of scarcity right they will always try and hoard and they will always be focused on you and not their customers alright so where their focus goes right where your attention goes uh shoot what is it where attention goes money flows that's one of my one of my money sayings um if someone is doing that right then they
(04:20) are purposely telling the marketplace that you are the focus not them and not their customers all right and so the thing to do and so these are the actions to take if you're in one of these situations if they get loud you get louder about yourself you get louder about your solutions you get louder about your purpose about your mission you never acknowledge them ever coke never acknowledges pepsi the classic never acknowledges the inferior there's no point you gain nothing the only thing that is gained is what they
(04:56) what they should hope that you do is that you give them credit right and as soon as you speak their name into existence they become more elevated and then they become on your level and so you can never acknowledge that they even exist all right but if they are allowed then your course of action is to become louder about your message and so if you need something to motivate you use it to motivate you to market harder to sell harder and the saying that i like to use in our company is beat them in the field all right if
(05:32) people are talking smack in the stands beat them in the field all right look at the scoreboard that's all we care about all right and so these are some of the things that over time i've kind of accumulated in my little toolkit of you know mental toolkit of how to deal with the haters and the people who copycat and steelers and all that kind of stuff is to understand that they need me i don't need them that when they focus on me they put more attention my way that the only thing that i can do in response is to get louder about my thing
(06:01) never acknowledge them right and finally just remember that the person who always gives the most to your customers wins period and the founder of hubspot said something that i think is really cool and powerful he said you don't have a customer until somebody has offered them a cheaper version of your solution and they have chosen not to take it that is when you have a customer and so i think that's really telling is that if you if you're so confident in the value you provide then you shouldn't be worried about it if you are worried
(06:31) about this person then double down on the value that you're providing to your customers and then it will help you sleep better channel the nervous energy or the angry energy that you have not at the competitor but target into the value that you're gonna provide to your customers all right so i'm not saying you know i'm some saint i'm saying i've done 22.
(06:52) i've got like i was counting with my uh my gm the other day we're talking about every single time somebody has tried to attack what is ours right has tried to take what is yours and uh saying from yellowstone the show that i like is that anything if you if you want anything if you have anything worth having people are going to try and take it from you right the only way to have something that no one will ever take from you is to have something that no one wants and if you want something that other people will have if you have something other people will
(07:21) want then you should expect that people will try and take it from you and you should take the fact that they are trying to take it from you as a sign of success that what you were doing is the right thing because they are trying to take it from me because it's an indicator that what you have is desirable all right and that's the game and the more desirable the state that you have is the more people will try and take her from you and so having these mental things these mental tools in your tool belt is very useful as an entrepreneur and
(07:48) i'll leave you with one final thing i think that when i look back on my life when i'm 80 or 90 years old i will be ashamed of things that i did and actions that i took out of malice and so i think that the truest guide that we can use for what actions we should take in response to others is what values do i want my life to exude what values do i want my actions to stand for and be in alignment with and if you don't think that inaction will be in alignment with the values that you would have when you're 80 or 90
(08:22) years old and you look back on the situation then don't do it right or do the action that is in alignment with those values and a lot of times the sad part about taking the high path is that when you win because right now i'm 22 for 22 in terms of people that i have defeated who have tried to to take what is ours um you don't actually get you don't get a victory lap you don't get a victory dance because when people lose to you you can't go stand on their corpse and teabag them like a like a uh like a video game right it doesn't work that
(08:56) way in the real world they disappear with a whimper they fade into not in into obscurance or into obscurity they fade into non-existence that's what ends up happening and when asked about why when they tell their own story they'll just say they decided to change their mind and didn't want to pursue it anymore because of xyz reason that they will cite about the industry and never take uh ownership for why they actually sucked and uh if you're one of those 22 people and you're watching this video um i remember you but i will never
(09:31) acknowledge your existence um and so i uh i say that because because when you win it's not that fulfilling because it's it's very rare that you actually get into a hot battle with somebody it's all happening in your mind and most people just don't have the skills to compete with you if you have a business and they'll eventually just disappear and it just sucks to have to deal with it and the thing is is when they disappear you'll have forgotten they exist to begin with and so it's not like you get an envelope in the mail that says the
(10:11) person you know waves the white flag they'll just move on with their lives and so will you until eventually you forget they exist and so yeah so that's the unfulfilling path of the victor but the thing you do get to have is you get the scoreboard and you get the business and you get the clients and you get the impact and that is really the only reward for continuing to act in the way that is in alignment with values and providing more value to your customers is that you'll just continue to win in the long haul and
(10:39) everyone else will just shrink in comparison to you so anyways mossy nation i make these videos a lot of people broke and i want to be one of them i don't want you to take a stupid action as a result of a competitor or ex-employee or an ex-client trying to siphon your clients it happens it's part of business the fact that they're doing it shows you that you're on the right path just don't do anything that 85 year old you wouldn't be proud of all right lots of love keep being awesome i'll catch you guys next video bye

Build Your Business Like Harvard - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiL0r5_dUvM

Transcript:
(00:00) Here's how to actually scale an education business. You feel like you're losing customers. You're not sure how to expand. And so education businesses, one, are they sellable? Two, are they valuable? And then three, where do they go wrong? I'm going to cover it all right now. Back streets back. All right.
(00:16) Or is it let's go? I don't know. I actually don't know the words to the song. Don't know the words to any song, believe it or not, except for one uh that I did for poetry class in seventh grade. Anyways, that's not why you're here. Here's the issue. Many people have education businesses, books, courses, coaching, all of that stuff.
(00:32) And they want to make sellable businesses. They also want their customers to never leave. And so they have these problems, which is that customers are leaving and their business isn't sellable. And they think there's something wrong with their business. And the answer is maybe. So let's dive into this.
(00:48) Number one, what makes Harvard Harvard? Well, number one is that Harvard has standards. So they have many people apply and only a few get in. If you accept everybody who has a credit card, that's not a very high standard. And so if you want to create a brand around education, you can't let everybody in. Thing number one. Thing number two, Harvard makes no promises.
(01:02) They don't say, "Hey, you're going to make this much money and you're gonna make this many days." They've completely, you know, gone away from that. And instead, it's just it costs this much money to get in and you might not get a result. Now, here's the here's the craziest part. Number three, not everyone passes.
(01:18) Not only does not everyone get in and everyone pays with no promise, not everyone passes. And so if you just look at those three criteria, there's more, but if you just look at those three criteria, you'd be like, "Oh, that's why they're different from 99% of other education businesses in general. They also do education." Now, what else is different about their thing? Well, it's in person versus remote, which is probably again another big differentiation for the vast majority of these businesses.
(01:40) On top of that, the network of the quality of the people is probably the most valuable thing that they give on top of the brand. They just curate an experience for very smart people and they slap their brand on top of them. fundamentally that's actually what they sell. What's the next issue that comes up for most people of like why is my business not a Harvard? They will then get into well my customers leave.
(01:59) So do Harvards. They leave after four years. Now they also have an extended time horizon in terms of the promise of when someone might get to the end of this thing. Yours is 6 weeks. Theirs might be six years. What is continuity in the form of education? Well, every quarter you have new courses and you have a curriculum.
(02:17) And so a lot of people who are in the education space are like,"I want to teach this one thing and I want people to pay me for it forever." And the reason for that is because people in the education space mistake a payment plan for continuity. So if you have sell something that cost $12,000 and you give them access to it for a year and people pay $1,000 a month, you don't have churn. People have graduated.
(02:38) You have a payment plan, not continuity. If you're trying to solve for continuity or solve for sellability, let's let's let's bring let's go into those. Why not? We're partying, right? A business that has enterprise value has reliability of future cash flow. Meaning there's a high likelihood that this business will continue to make money in the future.
(02:52) And so typically like a Harvard has a brand and so because of that brand, they're not worried about demand, right? They can demonstrate the fact that they have a certain number of people who are applying every year and a certain number of slots available. And so because of that supply demand discrepancy, because of the brand that they built, they are able to likely if it were a private enterprise, uh well it is private, but it's not a nonprofit.
(03:10) It's not a for-profit institution. It's a nonprofit technically. Let's not get into that. point is is that for your business to have value, you're going to have to build a brand around it that guarantees demand in the future because, and this is the big one, because education does not lead to continuity except under one circumstance. So, let me explain.
(03:26) So, if you teach someone to do a thing, they usually learn the thing if you're good and then they graduate from the thing and they should do that. But a lot of people are like, "Man, I want to have recurring revenue." But the thing is is that you have to break up the deliverable that you have into two different columns.
(03:39) All right? So, this is a good exercise for you to think through. Column A is what's the stuff that someone uses one time gets the value and then after they get the value it's no longer valuable. So if I teach you how to sell and then you know how to sell I don't need to teach you again you already have the value.
(03:52) If I teach you how to generate leads for yourself as soon as you learn the skill the skill now continues to provide value but I no longer provide value to you in teaching it. Right. Right. So there are education components which are typically onetime value. People aren't on a like for a Harvard for example they teach you you know communication 101. Okay.
(04:09) after that semester, you don't take communication 101 again. And it would be weird if they tried to charge you again for communication 101 because you're like, "Well, I already I already know it." But we do this and as a we as a entrepreneurs who who who do education stuff try and do this stuff all the time.
(04:22) Now you're like, "Wait a second then. How did Gym Launch sell for a lot of money if there was enterprise value?" Ah, because most people mistakenly think Gym Launch was an education business. And that's because the people who profit from education businesses try to sell you on that. as the owner of gym launch. I can tell you the vast majority of the enterprise value in that business was not from education because there's other things.
(04:42) So I said column A is onetime value. Column B is consumables. Things that continue to provide value again and again and again. If you look at your service, which I like to think about from that perspective, what are the other things that you have in the business that someone must use again and again and again? Examples for gym launch.
(05:00) One of the primary things that we do there is that we go and test ads in representative markets. We spend our own money to get ads that we know work. And then once we have that ad, we then sell it at a margin basically to everyone else. And it's 100% gross margins for us after we've incurred the initial cost of one filming the ads, you know, uh, editing the ads and then displaying the ads, actually running them, putting the money behind it to see which ones are the winners.
(05:24) But once we scoop up the four or five winners, we can just hand them to a thousand or 10,000 locations and they are valuable to each of those locations because within those local markets, they are new ads. But what do you need next month? More new ads. And so it is a consumable that has 100% gross margins that can be sold again and again and again.
(05:42) What else do you think someone could have that is consumable? There's a there's a great school community, for example, where they do 3D printing. So the guy teaches 3D printing. How do you do it? How do you set it up? Whatever. Onetime value. And then after that, every month, he scour the internet for new products that are hot and trending right now so that you could set up with your 3D printing business.
(06:01) And so people stay every month because they can get this list, the hot list, and then they grab the things off that list and they stay in there. And for him, he just has to do the one-time work of creating the list and then he can sell it over and over and over again. But people stay because they don't want to lose it. I'll give you a different business.
(06:13) There's a real estate business and they have super low churn. And one of the reasons they have low churn is because every month he has bird dogs. So basically people who go out and scout for properties and he puts a list out of properties that meet his criteria for his way of doing wholesaling. And so then people pay to be in his community in order to have access to this list of fresh properties.
(06:31) So he does the onetime work and then he basically licens that or fractionalizes the sale of that to many people. Now these are these are the consumable consumables. What other ones are common? Let's list let's think through them. So one of them is you've got community. Community in and of itself is actually a consumable thing.
(06:46) You use it this month, you use it next month, right? These are things that you can do. These are fundamentally why network effects exist. If you can build a valuable enough network, people don't want to leave that network. And fundamentally, that's what communities are on a micro level. Now, what are other things that you might use? You use traditional services, right? So, if you have a marketing agency, you might pay monthly.
(07:01) If you do SEO, you might pay monthly. And so, we have to look at our deliverables and think what are the things that are onetime and what are the things that are consumable. And then, here's the key part. We have to price them appropriately. The reality is that education extremely valuable. There's a reason that Harvard can spend, you know, charge $60,000 a year or 70 or whatever it is now is because that that is very valuable to educate someone gives them they basically pay today to increase their skill set so they can increase
(07:24) their future earnings. That's what education is about is literally increasing someone's future earnings. That's why people learn Or if it's, you know, if they want to learn how to paint, then I mean they could obviously monetize that too. But some people just want to learn how to paint or they want to know how to do music, they want to learn how to sing, whatever the skill is, right? But they pay today because they know that they're basically paying a discount over the long haul as long as they learn the skill. So in this
(07:43) context, how do we get customers to stick? One is with the pricing, we want to price the onetime value as high as we possibly can relative to what people are willing to pay. On the consumable part, we price it where people are also willing to pay if the other piece didn't exist. So think about this.
(07:58) This is the big mistake, right? This is the big mistake is that people will price their consumable at a payment plan of their onetime upfront value. For example, if something's worth $30,000, then they say, "Cool, you can pay $2,500 a month for 12 months and you're going to get this onetime value and this consumable value.
(08:16) " But then once people have kind of drained that onetime value, and sometimes it takes less time than a year, then people exit because the consumable value is not worth the $2,500. This is why I'm a big fan of the or big advocate of the big head longtail model, which is maybe the upfront thing is worth really $10,000 and your consumable thing might be worth a hundred, it might be worth 200, might be worth 500. I don't know what that is.
(08:36) But if you only sold that, so this is a good mental frame is if you only sold this thing, what do you think would be a price that people would not want to leave? That's the price you have for your continuity because that is the price that people willing to stay at. And typically, it's significantly lower than a a uh a spread out version of the upfront value of whatever the educational skill is.
(08:55) And so you have to differentiate those things. Now, beyond that, you might be like, well, shoot, my consumables aren't worth that much. Fine. Then structure your pricing so that you always have a value discrepancy between what you charge and what they what you what you deliver. Now the other piece of this is okay well I want to have enterprise value in the business which means that I should have a reliability of future revenue.
(09:14) Sure we have a little bit of our consumables that will stack up over time. Great. We have our upfront which typically serves to liquidate the acquisition cost at least how I like to structure things for the high high margin continuity that goes on the back end. But what else can we do? Well, what does Harvard do? They sell you more courses.
(09:29) They sell you more degrees. You want to have a you want to have a bachelor's. Guess what you have now? You want to get a masters? Get a masters. After a masters, what do you get? You get a PhD. Well, after a PhD, what do you get a double PhD? You get a super duper PhD, right? They'll keep selling you.
(09:41) But the thing is is that's the continuity. That's the latter is just what's the higher level version. But they also know that it's that it's a it's a fraction of that, right? If a 100 kids go to uh get a bachelor's, it might only be 10% or 20%, I don't know the numbers, 20% that they get a masters. And of the masters, maybe it's only 10% of them to get a PhD.
(10:00) Also, the pricing also reflects that. Interesting. Right now, back to the stickiness of the business. A piece of advice. Don't start an education business and then say, "I'm going to make it a SAS company." Famous last words. Now, if you're white labeling somebody's tool, whatever. It's not really yours and fine.
(10:20) That's really just you being an affiliate of someone else's thing. Whatever. But if you're like, I'm going to start something from scratch, the likely that you succeed is basically zero. And when I say succeed, it's like actually have a true software exit. I have yet to see literally yet to see and I look at a lot of businesses and I kind of sit in this space like I understand pretty well.
(10:38) I have yet to see a business that has successfully done this and the likely that you were the special snowflake is probably not a bet that I'd be willing to make. You might feel like a special snowflake. Your mama might have told you you're a special snowflake. Your father, well, hopefully he didn't tell you a special snowflake.
(10:51) He should hopefully have have you prove it. But the point is it's unlikely and I prefer to make bets that where if I wait I win. And if I look around and look at the marketplace and no one's won using this path, it's probably because it's a flawed path. And it is because when you attract someone with education, then you're trying to keep keep them with software, it typically doesn't work unless it's a core function of the business and you're fully focused on it, which you probably are.
(11:18) So if you want something that is super sellable, then you want something that's sticky. If you want something that's sticky, then make the business about the sticky thing. A lot of stickiness here, right? Now, the trade that most people in education and even media companies make is that instead of having something that is inherently valuable as an asset, they tend to just make more money than they otherwise would with a similar scale business in just about any other space.
(11:39) And I see that as the trade of future value or future money for today's dollars. I'll give you a story. So, a buddy of mine had a business. He worked on it for between 8 and 12 years, I can't remember. And he took a salary of $70,000 a year. And at the end of that period of time, he sold the business software company for $250 million.
(11:54) So $70,000 a year for eight years, 10 years, 12 years. He lived on Dave Ramsey style, uh, paid his house off, like lived on that. And then boom, $250 million. He could have done an education business and maybe made $10 million a year for that whole time. He's skilled enough of an entrepreneur. And so the question is, how do you want to make money? And I want to be clear, I don't think there's anything wrong with saying, I have a business that makes me $10 million a year that I'll never be able to sell. Well, you get to enjoy the
(12:19) $10 million every single year. So, I mean, life's only going in one direction. It's getting shorter. So, I mean, I don't think there's anything inherently wrong with that. There's this kind of mantra of what I call the three marshmallow problem. So, there's the the typical story of the child who, you know, gets put into a room and he gets one marshmallow now, and if he doesn't eat the marshmallow, he gets two marshmallows.
(12:40) The problem uh with that for those those of you who learn how to delay to gratification is that once you learn that skill, you then want to delay gratification forever and then you hope for this third marshmallow that might never come. Think about different versions of this experiment. If we were to say, hey, you get one marshmallow now and if you wait a year, you can get a second marshmallow.
(12:58) Is it worth waiting a year for a second marshmallow? Like, is the payoff of a second marshmallow worth it? Maybe, maybe not. Is it worth it at 10 years? Is it worth it at at the end of your life you get the second marshmallow? Maybe, maybe not. And so I think a lot of people ma uh mistake delaying gratification with maximizing gratification. Yes, it's true.
(13:16) Delaying gratification in general tends to uh especially at the beginning increase your reward. But at some point there is a diminishing return in my opinion beyond which you should just get your reward right also there's this uh misconception I think that by taking the reward unlike the experiment that it prevents you or precludes you from getting another marshmallow again later which often times it doesn't.
(13:38) And so I think there's a sweet spot and that's like most things is that the magic is in the middle is being able to balance both extremes. And what many people will do, strive especially, will just suffer for extended periods of time and then sometimes they don't even get the second marshmallow and the first marshmallow stale.
(13:56) I don't see an issue with the fact that the business that you have might just generate more cash flow and not really be that sellable. That's okay. It's a trade you make and I think that's a it's a reasonable trade. But if you want to get have your cake and eat it too, then there is one specific type of education that does have continuity.
(14:10) And so that's what I I'll dive into. So obviously all the components that I talked about that are consumables, those will drive continuity. But there is one specific type of education that drives continuity, which is continued education. So there are professions where you have to stay upto-date with technology.
(14:25) You have to stay upto-date with new practices. where if you can build a business where you reertify people on new skills or new technologies that come out on a consistent basis, then that membership, which is really what the business is, that membership business can over time continue to compound and you can demonstrate that people will stay with you for an entire career.
(14:43) If you can demonstrate that, then you have a business that is very valuable and is an education and can sell at almost a tech multiple. And fundamentally, inherently technology businesses aren't they don't get these multiples because it's not like, oh, I have a software, therefore I I get a software exit. Like, no one gets this. And the thing is is that people will preach this because they want to sell you on that idea.
(15:03) But that's not how an investor sees it. The things that make a software valuable are the things that make a business valuable, which is that there is revenue retention, there's high gross margin, there's high incremental margin, there's less operational drag at scale. These are all the things that make software companies at scale more valuable.
(15:19) It's not that the fact that they use code that makes them valuable. If you sell people into a software and they turn out, you know, every six months, that's not valuable. It's basically the same as a service and you're going to be valued based on the fact that you have customers that come in every, you know, come in and out all the time.
(15:34) And the thing that you'd have to establish is a brand that would then prove out the fact that you're going to continue have demand like Harvard for years to come. And so, if you're not doing this, then you're basically just building something that generates cash flow, which to be fair, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that.
(15:44) But the big misconception is the idea that number one, there's something wrong with it. Number two, that I have to add software or something to make my company valuable, which it won't make it valuable. It'll likely make it a distraction and decrease the size of the business. Number three, we're go we're cranking.
(16:00) You're charging too much for the consumption and too little for the education. You probably need to do this. Charge more for the upfront thing because it is life transforming value. And then charge less for the thing that's ongoing because it probably is less valuable than the other one. And if you're like, I'm not sure if mine is less valuable.
(16:14) Well, just look at your chart. People are telling you if it's less valuable. And if you don't have something that is consumption based, think about what components of whatever it is that you sell someone must consume on a monthly basis they use and reuse so that you can get them to buy again and again. So these are my qualms with education done right.
(16:30) This is how I think about it. And hopefully that that should put to rest one uh how do I sell my education business? Well, it's not about an education business. It's about keeping a business that keeps customers for a long time and having high gross margins. I gave you one model that does work.
(16:44) The other model is having a stack of consumables. Continued education is also a method that works there. But again, that's the new thing. That's the PhD. That's the masters. It's certification level one, two, three, four, five, six, right? It's it's the extra thing that you're doing. And you have to understand that there's going to be a trade-off or drop off at each level.
(16:58) Now, if you sell only continued educ education on the front end, then you have people already have a prerequisite. So then the issue there is going to be finding the people already have their prerequisite that matches your continued education demands. All businesses have problems. Now, if I wanted to go use my marketing skills on something because you probably if you sell education, you have to get good in marketing and sales.
(17:14) It's one of the parts of the business. If you want to build something like that, then let me give you the easiest hack in the world to build something that's really valuable. Find stuff people already don't stop buying. Then use your marketing and sales skills on that, which is fundamentally what we did with private equity.
(17:28) So, what do I put in my feature set to make it stick here? So, number one is I would add as few things as possible. And you likely can delete things. This is big. This is very big. How many education businesses do you know that include calls, accountability, some sort of resource library, uh library of all past, you know, Q&A calls or one-on-one calls? Probably a lot of them.
(17:50) Have any of them solved churn? No. If you want to have a feature set, the way that I think about feature sets is that I want each feature to be on its own valuable enough to more than justify three or four times the price. If someone can't just say it's worth it for this alone, then I don't want it in the stack.
(18:07) And that may mean you only have three or four things or two things or one thing and you just do it really well. That's fine. So that's in terms of how I'm thinking through it. In terms of what things should I should I add and when we have to answer what problem are we solving? If people are churning and you have an education business, well unless you're doing continued education, that is the nature of the business and you're probably mispriced on the back and probably mispriced on the front end.
(18:25) In terms of when to add it, it would be when I know that this particular service is something that people consume again and again and again. So if you get repeated questions month after month after month of a problem that that needs to get solved, this is where service businesses start to sprout off of education.
(18:42) Now, what you'll realize is if you do the service well, the service business itself will be more valuable than the education business because they're not coming for the education. They're coming for the service. They come for the service. They'll keep paying for the service if it's good. Part of the reason that sometimes service businesses even if the service should be sticky, they aren't sticky is because of the nature of the customers.
(18:57) So let me explain that. So if you have customers that are inherently volatile, then their volatility will reflect on the volatility of your product or service. And so if you're dealing with VSNB, so very small business owners or proumers, people who just, you know, they have a job and they they kind of upgrade.
(19:13) Those people are notoriously volatile. They're going in and out all the time. They, you know, get passionate, get unpassionate, they get whatever. And so it doesn't matter how good the thing is, you're going to have churn that's going to be there. And so you have to make sure that you're comparing what churn, what you expect to churn or you want to get to.
(19:26) Like uh Facebook has super high churn. If you think about churn is people who stop using the product. Now I say super high relative to salesforce but way better than every other social media platform. And so uh you look at Shopify. Shopify I think is considered best-in-class. They think I think they have 55 or 60% renewal on an annual basis.
(19:43) Meaning they lose 40% of customers every year. But the people who stick after that year stick for the long haul. You're going to have involuntary churn, the lower on the um axis you go. What you want to make sure is that after people reach a milestone, they never leave. So that's what you're really going for. So if you have some period of time, let's call it 12 months, where people turn in and out and then after 12 months, no one ever leaves because they they reach certain uh benchmarks or certain activation points. If you get there, then you have
(20:09) a valuable business because those people you just have this year up front that doesn't matter and doesn't really factor in the value of the business. But the valuable part of the business is you do this functionally as a sales motion in order to generate this reliable recurring revenue stack and you're just filtering through to find the diamonds.
(20:22) So the question was what kind of churn benchmarks exist so I know if I'm doing uh you know good or bad. I I can tell you on school because we have a lot of metrics there. Uh 18% monthly churn is the average school community churn. So if you're doing 10% you're doing like basically about half that.
(20:36) So that's it's you know decent good. Uh if you're above that you probably have some things you can improve on. Uh if you're at 5% so that means that you have 20 month LTVs. If you're like how did you do that math? All you do is you just take one divided by your monthly churn. So one divided 10 by 10% monthly churn means 10 months of average stay. 5% is 20 months.
(20:52) One divided by point. You know if you have 1% turn then you have uh 100, right? 100 months. What's good? What's bad? Well, the lower the better. Duh. The the piece that we I would really care about is M12. So the the 12 month retention. How many people get to month 12? And of those people, what's my turn on them? If my turn on them is zero, then I'm very excited, right? If they're also just slowly turning out as well, then I just have this very long tail and I have to always keep selling people, which of course every business has to
(21:16) keep selling people. The percentage is going to matter based on the industry and who you serve by a wide margin. If you're serving high-end enterprise, then it should be like you should be 80% annual renewal or higher. If you're serving, you know, beginners, then it's going to be it's going to be high and that's also a feature, not a bug.
(21:32) It's just part of selling to that customer. For me, what I care about fundamentally is the cost and the return of a permanent customer. So, let me let me break this down. This is probably the most important concept. All we care about in any business is how many permanent customers do we have. So let's say that you have, you know, for every 10 people who buy your education, three of them transfer over to your service.
(21:52) And of the three that transfer your service, one of them never leaves. Then we just have to know, okay, it cost me 10 times my current cost to acquire a customer to get one person who never leaves. What's that LTV to CAC ratio? If you're having just your LTV to CAC ratio for for front-end business, that's different than LTV to CAC LTV to permanent what's my permanent CAC to a permanent LTV, they just never leave.
(22:13) And if you're like, well, I don't I don't really have that yet. Well, yeah, cuz that's the hard part of business. Once you figure out the product market fit of what's my feature stack, what type of customer is that feature stack better, you know, better served for? So that 12 months from now, these people never want to leave.
(22:27) Once you solve that part, that is the hard part of business. That is the hardest question to solve. Once you solve that, then everything else is basically just math of how do I find more of those people? And if I have to go through five to get to one, then this is one permanent customer and then it just becomes a cash flow question, which is why people raise money and then they get really aggressive.
(22:44) But then you want to see like, okay, is there a way that I can either select better on the front end or is there a way that I can increase activation so it becomes one out of four instead of one out of five. But we have to get to that one point you have a permanent customer and then build backwards from there.
(22:54) When do you upsell other feature stacks? Well, it's going to be based on their need. If someone comes in and has all of these needs, then you'd sell it nationally at that point. If someone has one problem solved but then creates another problem, a simple example would be like, "Hey, I teach people how to do, you know, DM setting or whatever.
(23:08) " So, you teach people how to, you know, reach out to people and create appointments. Okay. Well, once they learn how to do it themselves, what's the next thing they're going to want? They're going to want other people to do it for them. And so, if you want to sell a service of placement for those people or sell some sort of like fractionalized service where you have a pool of people that works for many people or you say, "Hey, I'll employ them myself so you don't have to deal with the liability or risk, but I charge 20% above and I pre-train
(23:26) them and that's the ongoing rate." Fine. Like these are all different business models you could have there, but you can't sell the the GM setter, I don't think. Well, you could upfront, but likely they would have to have the business model and understanding first and then you would upsell them on the back end.
(23:40) So offer timing matters just as much if not more uh than the offer itself. Like sometimes you have the absolute right offer and you're just offering at the wrong time. So people say, "Hey, I really want to start uh you know a business that has enterprise value." They'll say, "I want a real business." I don't think there like fundamentally if you exchange goods and services for money, then you have a real business.
(23:54) So you've got some you got to deal with your own head trash on that. If you define real business as a business that becomes an asset that's sellable to somebody else, fine. I understand that. But don't let anyone make you believe that there's something inherently wrong about the business you have. If you follow the law and you exchange goods and services for money and you make a profit, then there's in in the eyes of Alex, there's nothing wrong with what you do.
(24:13) You you you use the skills you got to to provide for your family. I don't think there's any shame in that. I I would die on that hill. Beyond that, if you're like, I would just prefer to have a different business or I'd rather have a business that doesn't rely on I'd rather have a business I could sell someday because I have whatever goals that I have. Fine.
(24:26) I have yet to see the I'm going to use my cash flow from my education thing to feed my uh you know software or service business and then let that take off. Usually what ends up happening is that both businesses end up taking your attention and the service business doesn't put as much cash flow out. Neither does a software company.
(24:44) And your lifestyle has already accustomed to the the higher income level that you've generated from your high cash flow business. And so, uh, you never really want to give it up because you don't want to take a lifestyle cut, which most people can. And so, they end up not being able to pursue it.
(24:56) If you do make the jump, you can win. So, I want to be clear. Sam Ovens from school had consulting.com, sold and shut down consulting.com, went all in on school. Alex Becker with Hyros had Market Hero, which is an education business, sold and shut that down, started hyros, went all in on Hyros, made it work, and both have succeeded exceptionally well. Same same.
(25:15) If you want to do it, do it. But no half measures. Well, hopefully that puts uh the nail in that coffin for those of you who are unsure about that. I get that question probably twice a month and hopefully that just resolves that. And if you like this type of business breakdown, I actually break down real businesses all the time.

I STARTED AND SOLD 6 BUSINESSES BY AGE 32...my boring formula.. - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) 99 of businesses end up closing down over a long enough time horizon only one percent of businesses ever get sold or trained chance and the reason for that is not because you know the the what you might think right you might think that it's because business owners don't know how to sell their business or don't know how to market the business to get sold but that's actually not the real reason the real reason is because most businesses are worthless and so what i want to talk about today is how to go from a worthless business
(00:26) to a business that has actual value hi my name is alex from joseon acquisition.com we're in a portfolio company that has 85 million a year and so my goal here at this channel is that there's a lot of people who are broken i don't want you to be one of them all right and so right now if you're a small business owner um which you know there's 30 million small businesses or whatever it is a lot most of these businesses don't actually have value and the reason for that is because they are not businesses they are they are jobs right
(00:51) and so if you remember robert kiyosaki's uh his his wealth quadrant i think he goes employee self-employed uh owner and then then investor i believe that's the quadrant i could be wrong but i'm pretty sure that's what it is at least that's how i would draw it in my head in terms of some progression so most of us have you know most people have jobs first right and then they make a certain amount of money they're relatively skilled and they think you know i could do something like this on my own right or i could do something else on my own
(01:13) and so then they switch to self-employed and what they don't know is that switch from box one to box two is that you actually take a decrease in pay and the re the reason for that is because you actually aren't that good yet you know how to do one thing well here and because of that because you fit into a larger machine you're able to earn higher pay because as a as a sum of parts uh you can actually provide more value right but when you actually have to be each of the parts uh you're not that good at it yet and so you become
(01:38) self-employed and you actually make significantly less for a long period of time the thing is is that most people who are self-employed have an llc right and so they consider themselves to be business owners but the reality is that they are not business owners they are self-employed and even if you have other employees that work for you you are still self-employed here's the litmus test for this right what happens is and i have these conversations all the time because there's companies that apply to to become portfolio companies uh with us so
(02:01) we can invest in the companies and help them help them grow and that's just for fy it's when you're over five million bucks a year so if you're not there then don't worry about all this stuff is free so just consume it all right the the thing that happens though is that they stop doing the actual fulfillment of the thing whatever the widget is whether whatever they're selling right where the service is they're not actually doing the fulfillment and so in that moment they're like i now own a business and i'm a business owner and now i can sell
(02:24) this business and that's so far from the truth because there are so many other things that must happen right uh in order for a business to be sellable because for business to be sellable it must be an asset they can run without you now you might think again here's the fallacy that your business can run without you and that's because maybe you don't do the actual thing but you're still involved in maybe the marketing and the sales right if you can't get someone to replace you in that then you can't sell it now you might
(02:50) think i'll just sell and then somebody else will do that it's not going to be a sellable thing no one's going to do that because they're like well you haven't done it well why would i believe that someone can do it besides you because you haven't proved it and so what you have to do is prove to what a future buyer would be that this business can operate on its own without you right and so the next step right is that you replace the acquisition so first you have the services that you're not doing then you replace the acquisition process
(03:12) to be something that is reliable pick one of the channels you want you could pick referrals you could pick affiliates you could pick uh manual outbound which is cold calls called emails whatever you could pick uh owned media which is like all the people that you already have contact with that you can message you could have uh earned media which is that you you start creating a channel of your own that that a platform will distribute your content that's how you generate a business or you could do paid traffic right you
(03:33) could you could do paid media and start running ads on a consistent way to generate sales right no matter what it is you have to have a consistent process where you know if you put x effort or x dollars in this side that you will get y uh outcome on the other side right and if you don't have that then you don't have a sellable business now here's what happens next so first you you productize your service so it's a consistent thing that you deliver it over and over again you're not custom if it's custom it's gonna be terrible
(03:57) and it's gonna be it's gonna be valued as a service-based business which is gonna suck and you're not gonna be able to sell it you're gonna have a massive earn out which basically means you're gonna work for the next five years to earn the exact same pay except you no longer own the business and the person who gives you the earn out has all the upside and you you take all the risk and they got all the upside so no bueno there and so you've privatized the service you you you're you have a predictable acquisition process right
(04:17) and you're like now i can sell the business ah wait there's more because the thing is is that you still own all the hats you still might be managing the sales team you might still be managing the marketing you still might be innovating the product you still might be making uh all the chief decisions right you still might even be operating the business just not actually doing any of those things and so to say that like i am now a business owner and this this works without me is not true you were just you were doing higher
(04:42) level skills which believe it or not are more expensive to replace believe it you know and so now you have to go find someone who's going to become your vp of sales so you can take that hat off and who's going to become your your your director of marketing so you can take that off and who's going to become the the chief product guy who's going to be consistently innovating the product and improving it so that it you know delivers excess value to your customers right so you have all these hats on and so the process of entrepreneurship of
(05:06) transitioning from self-employed where you literally have 100 hats right to transition your business owner where you take all the hats off your head and you were just a shareholder which is how i prefer to see it it's like you have to think of yourself not as the owner but as the director of the board as the as the as the chief shareholder in the company right rather than the owner okay even even that change in language i think is helpful and it was for me what we have to do here and if you're like man that's
(05:28) gonna take a long time to do that duh that's why most businesses don't get sold and that's why sometimes it takes years to build something that's great right it might take you three years it might take you five years it might take you ten years right to get the business at that point and if you're like man if i only just had xyz insert person i could do this welcome to entrepreneurship like the game is about people right once you have the model and you have some of the tactics in the beginning so you can get some initial
(05:51) traction like the rest of it is people right people are the thing that are going to run this machine for you and that means you have to learn how to recruit have to how to hire how to manage and how to lead right and those are the soft skills that are harder to to um they're less tangible but they're just as important if not more so right when you look at the the biggest billionaires and multi-millionaires out there they have they keep their their their space around them very clean they know what they stand for they know and people are
(06:16) attracted to them because they have admirable qualities and traits and that is how you get the higher level people so think about this so let's say that you've got somebody who who's a who's a brilliant marketer who can generate demand like crazy for you right well that person isn't going to work for someone who's lower skilled than they are right you have to have more skills to attract the type of people that you want who are going to help you run this business and grow it because they have to believe in the vision they want to do
(06:42) something that's meaningful and so um the the journey here is understanding and this is the piece that i think most people miss is that they don't even know the hats that they are wearing you making decisions is a hat it's an important hat right and so selling it without the person who can make decisions isn't a business right if you're selling it and you're still the chief chief marketing officer you're the one who's controlling the messaging and the branding and all of those things it's still like that that
(07:09) that role still exists and so there's typically far more leadership that has to occur in order for the business to be sellable and here's the thing now all of a sudden all of these roles that you've been doing up to this point you've been taking profit profit sell discretionary earnings sde right from the business when in reality a lot of that profit must be allocated back to the roles that you're doing but you're not choosing to pay yourself for right what happens is a business will become more sellable as you replace all of the pieces that
(07:37) you're doing and oftentimes the margin will drop but that is okay because now you have 100 of your time back and then you are truly a shareholder in the company and this takes years not months not weeks and the thing is is you're gonna hire somebody who you think is gonna be good at marketing and they're not gonna be and then you have to hire another person and then you think they're gonna be good at marketing and they're not then you gotta hire another person right and if you're like man that sounds tiring that's the reason most
(07:57) people who own big companies are like it is hard to do this this is not easy this is not for the faint of heart you must have a long-term vision that you are committed to because you will burn out if you're only doing it for the money you will because once you've satisfied your personal needs you'll just stop being you'll stop being inspired by the reason that you're doing this right and the thing is is your employees will be even less inspired because all of it starts with you and then gets diluted down and so if you are not extremely
(08:20) potent right you are not extremely distilled down in terms of your vision of where you want to go and why you're doing this why this business even exists then other people be even less so and less committed to that vision and you will attract lower quality people and they will they will turn out and they will not be skilled etc what happens is the small businesses become big businesses because you need to slowly grow them so that you can accommodate more people right who can actually do all of the things that you do and the
(08:45) reality is that you're not going to find because right now you're like well there's one of me so i just need to hire one more person but that's not that's not reality right you might be doing six things and you might have to hire six people to do what you are doing and of course you do and that sounds unreasonable but welcome to business and so for businesses to be scalable oftentimes they have to have significant enough gross margins and volume to be able to pay for high quality talent to be able to actually do these things to take
(09:09) decisions off your plate and where you get into the point of kind of like hyper growth and hyperscale where you're starting to talk 10 million 20 million 30 million plus per year right is when you have people who come with solutions pre-loaded they come with experience of having done the thing that you need to solve already so this like you'll notice the transition the business owner and i'll tell you this right now is that once you start crossing multiple eight figures the people that you are hiring are better than you are
(09:34) at everything and that's one of the that's one of the that's one of the weird things that happens because in the beginning most people don't have the skills that you do right and so you have to hire people who are not as good as you are and then you have to train them right and then later on you start hiring people who are okay at some things you still have to train them on how you want it done so they have they've done the type of role in the business in the past but they don't know how you want it done here so you
(09:57) have some training but there's less and there's some experience right the level above that is when people come in they know what to do they know how to do it better better than you for your specific business and when that happens then you realize how how little utility you actually have in the business and how your really only role is to just recruit people right recruit people and and cast the vision of where you or want to make the bet for the company of where you want it to go and so anyways um the reason that most
(10:25) businesses are worthless is because they sell entirely customized things they sell to everyone which makes it completely unscalable they're the ones who are still heavily involved in the acquisition in the rain making and so because of that um and then even then even after they've graduated from getting out of the selling and getting out of the fulfillment the the business still doesn't have value because they might still be the talking face they still may be the spokesperson which means that the the business has no value
(10:47) outside of themselves because no one else could take it over right unless the person agreed to a three or five year earn out which then means that you transfer the ownership to someone else they get all the upside and if you don't hit the milestones they get your business anyways and you get none of the money right and so it may sound arduous to do this and it is but i can tell you that having now gone through this process it is one of the most worthwhile things that you can do is look at the business as a true sellable asset
(11:11) because i heard this from i heard this quote from an mit dude who spoke from john warlow's book but anyways uh he said all of you guys are busy selling your services what you should be doing is selling your business right you as the ceo or the owner your job is to sell the business the job of the of the sales people is to sell the products right once you can make the transition from your businesses or your products rather than your services of the business are the products you look you move up in a level of of um
(11:41) an order of magnitude right and so i'm not saying that you should immediately be selling your business right but you should be making your business sell a bull and the beauty of this is that when you go through this process you end up having phenomenal leverage in any kind of negotiation that you want to have in the future and this is a a key hack for negotiating fyi is that don't need the deal the guy who needs to deal the less is the way that you negotiate like that is like everyone wants all these tricks and
(12:05) tactics and things for negotiating the way to have the way to have the best negotiation is to have the most leverage the way to have the most leverage does not need the deal simple right simple not easy how about that and so if you want to sell your business someday for a lot of money then the business must be sellable and in order for you to do that you must get the business to the point where you don't even mind keeping it because it's still cash flow so much money to you and you don't do anything that is the position of fu that is the
(12:31) position where you'll get the most money because now you have something that people want no one wants a business where the owners you know no one wants to buy themselves a job right and they don't want to buy themselves your job and so you have to think and this is the critical self-awareness of thinking like what are the actual things that i do everyone likes to think oh no i don't do anything this thing ruins itself except if you step away and didn't answer calls for two months with the business store on itself probably not right so then we
(12:53) have to look at what are we actually doing and it might be little little fractional things that we're doing all over the place but we still have to quantify those things and we still have to put processes around them and then hand them to people and see how they do and then continue to improve them until eventually you get to that promised land where you don't actually have to do anything and you can still own the business and i mean to prove this like you can probably own shares of companies on the public traded market they have figured this out
(13:16) right and you can own a piece and participate in the upside without ever ever looking at what apple is doing for their for their roadmap right and so we have to get to that point as business owners in order to make the asset that we own the most valuable thing that we have probably the biggest thing on our net worth balance sheet is all the the equity that we have in our businesses and to increase the value of that equity we have to make it so that it actually a business and we transition from employee to self-employed to owner right and then
(13:41) the transition there goes from owner to investor because when you make that transition that is when you start seeing your business for what it is which is a sellable asset that sits on your net worth balance sheet all right and so um this is one of the hardest lessons that took me the longest amount of time to learn i'm hopefully just translating this to you because i see so many people who are like i want to sell my business but the business is not sellable and it is worthless without them and so we can't just say oh the next person's
(14:02) going to figure it out because they're not going to i'll tell you right now they're not going to you have to figure it out and what most people do instead is they just start another business because they don't know how to solve the problem and so we must confront the problems that we have which is you have to articulate the thing that you don't know how to do as a problem that you can solve which is i don't know how to insert find hire direct a marketing director i do not know how to find a vp of sales uh and train them and manage
(14:24) them and grow them i do not know how to find a chief you know product officer who's going to innovate the product on my behalf and make it better than i ever could and make a better product and make a better client experience around and consistently improve it based on these metrics until we can articulate what the problems are we cannot solve them and if we consistently live in this world of like i just want to sell my business someday you're not going to be able to until you put these pieces in place so that the business is sellable and
(14:49) actually has value in and of itself separate from you and then when that happens your net worth will skyrocket because now you have something that everyone wants which is an asset that produces cash while you sleep so anyways uh my name is oxford moses own acquisition.com which portfolio company says 85 million a year keeping awesome if you like this hit the subscribe button uh if you didn't like this i love you either way and i'll see you guys next video bye

Why I chose to disappoint my dad - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To8jcTDwcxc

Transcript:
(00:00) my dad always told me that you only get one name so invest in it accordingly and i always thought about that i thought it was a really good line just like you only get one name like you can change your companies you can go bankrupt but like your name stays with you yeah and so that can either be an asset or it can be a liability well i usually ask my guest how did you get this job so i was a management consultant right out of college i did space cyber intelligence for the military which was sounds much cooler than it really was
(00:31) but i had a top secret clearance it sounded really good at dinner parties and just about only that um and you know one day i looked out for my balcony because i had a really nice place because i could afford it at the time um and i was like is this it and i was you know in my young 20s you know at that point i had done everything that i think i was supposed to do so i was you know i did well in school i you know was president of all the clubs you know graduated in three years got the good job um and i realized that it was i was living
(00:56) you know a life for me that my father wanted me to live and so that was kind of you know i went i i faltered back and forth for probably a period of six months um of really not wanting this to be my life but not wanting to let my dad down and so at some point the the thing that kind of pushed me over the edge was i can either you know die to myself or i can die to my father and at the end of the day you know i have to survive so i will if i if i make this decision and he no longer wants to be my dad then i can
(01:24) accept that wow was that extreme then yes say more about that are you an only child yeah so only child raised by a single father um middle eastern um he was born in iran and um you know i everything in my life up until that point was really just to make him proud so i it was very much a seeking approval seeking validation kind of drive at that point in my life and so the idea of disappointing him or not getting his approval felt like death and at that point i was actually contemplating not living you have watched some of my youtube stuff
(01:54) mortality has been the single biggest driver and the biggest decisions that i've made in my life and it has become a more routine process for decision making for me in general because i think it provides clarity and it provides context to most of the decisions we have which the vast majority of them don't matter which is helpful in and of themselves and then you know beyond that it helps me make the decisions that i think removes everyone else from the playbook because if you if you study subjective well-being and how
(02:22) people perceive how they're doing in their own lives it looks like a smiley face so seven-year-olds think they're killing life and then it drops dramatically between 20 and 30. and then there's still a little bit more of a dip right around 45 that's like when people are their true they hate life the most and then and then it kind of slowly get goes up to like 55 60 and then it shoots right back up again when people see that they're going to die and that life is short and that they can make the decisions without worrying about the
(02:49) ramifications of other people and some of the people they're worried about are also dead and so it was using that context for that biggest decision that's been duplicated many times in my life since then because if i have a good decision-making algorithm i try and reuse it as many times as i can let's unpack it for the audience a little bit so you know when we're seven we don't have a care in the world uh the artist or the whatever we want to be has not been beaten out of us yet uh no one's told us that we are not what we
(03:14) think we are we're still popping wheelies and climbing trees and falling out and that's okay and then you get to your 20s and 30s and the rubber hits the road a little bit and if you've made money i guess and if that's your sign of success then you're okay but if not you're kind of hosed then in your 40s i'm guessing uh you start to have more life experience 50s maybe you start caring less what people think and then um and then you fast forward all the way to maybe near death and then you really get to a point where
(03:47) you don't care what anyone says and you really boil it down to what's important and probably i'm guessing that's love relationships uh legacy and then you just like peace out i think for most people yes for me specifically the legacy piece less so um but i think for most people yes and why is the legacy piece less important um more so and i whenever i get into this topic i think a lot of like some people get sensitive about it and so i just like to put the disclaimer like this is not me judging your beliefs and me
(04:17) stating my beliefs is in no way yeah a judgment on anywhere else um but if you just look at expanding the time horizon over a much longer period of time if you look at it in ten thousand years or a hundred thousand years or a million years right the easy way to test this is to go backwards right which is do you know your great great great great great great grandfather probably not and then if you look at it from a how much has somebody achieved standpoint um i happen to be in an interesting situation where my great great grandfather was in the
(04:42) ruling class in iran and he had 400 children so he was literally you know like ruled and had a lot of wealth he had a lot of wives to create 400 children right and i actually still can't remember his name because my dad told me one time and i can't remember it and i've never seen any of the quote legacy that i'm sure he felt like he was leaving and so if that was that level of success and legacy and only four or five generations later i don't even remember the man's name nor do i have any piece of that legacy yeah
(05:09) it seems a little bit irrelevant when the revolution happened in iran we talk about legacy lands buildings houses bank accounts government says those are ours now that's it there's your legacy gone that's why i'm like and people were like i want to build a legacy i'm like u.s might not even be the superpower in 500 years your kids your kids might be in in bangladesh who knows india might be the hot spot 500.
(05:37) no one knows right and i think in a long enough time verizon we're all screwed and i think in some ways people find that incredibly disheartening but an equal opposite is you can't find it both disheartening and also not freeing because all of the decisions that we're making that are not for ourselves or what or are are subject to change that we feel pressure from whether that be society societal i'll put quotes there because that's a big word um or family friends expectations that we perceive other people to have of us if you can if you can just relinquish
(06:07) all of those chains i think it's incredibly freeing and um i choose to live that way that advice is good because it helps us live in the moment because you know even if you believe in something after that's still in the future yeah and there's a question mark because no one actually knows with you know with knowledge what happens or if something happens so you might as well live in the present make the best of it yeah an interesting one um that i thought through around that was um a lot of us not a lot of us all of us have 100
(06:37) experience uh not being alive right before we were born we were not alive and so we know what that was like there was nothing um that we can recollect and so i would imagine that that's the closest experience that we can have to not being live yet again which to me is not that frightening yeah and it is freeing you're right because it's it's both uh humbling to know that you don't matter in the grand scheme of things but at the same time you matter infinitely if you just focus on the present and the the mark that you're going to
(07:06) leave here and now i i contemplated i had to die to my father died of myself and i realized that i i would rather die to him which pretty much ended up happening and so my fears were relatively justified he was not in support of the things that i wanted to do i ended up quitting that job sold everything i had packed my car went to california because that's what i thought the land of fitness opportunity was because that was the only thing i really enjoyed mentored under a guy for a few months to try and at least learn
(07:29) the ropes started my first facility slept on the floor for the first nine months which was a very terrible experience for me and time stamped the age for me now i was 23. so you graduated early you got that dream job and then you bailed yeah two years and that was really at the time and all of this kind of it was at the a splitting point where i had done two years and the kind of career path traditionally is like two to four years of management consulting and then you go back to an ivy league for your gmat and
(07:56) then from there you go into you know you can you can go do investment banking you can do private equity you can do you know some of the bigger white collar jobs but um it was i just didn't i didn't want more of what i had um and so i thought that i would have a better shot taking 200 000 in two years which is what the you know economic equivalent of what the degree was and starting something on my own i figured i would learn more in the first two years and with that money and maybe even have a business by the end of that period of
(08:21) time that made an equivalent amount of money compared to what i would have had as a job offer but how did you what signals did you get i mean you're saying like i wasn't feeling it but like where was your motivation because i see you as this hustler this go-get is all about gobbling up new opportunities it transcends beyond that now but like at first it sounds like you were just all about the go get but how did you know i mean at first i was driven by fear okay it was all fear fear of failure feel of disappointment fear of other
(08:50) people's judgment right what did your dad end up saying did he say good luck with you no he thought he was stupid though i was wasting my life yeah and wasted a degree that he'd spent money on and yeah wasted a good job opportunity that he had set up for me all these things right in his defense did he immigrate here yeah okay so in his defense 100 right and i just want to tell the audience so that they're not like but it's like you know if you have justified in saying that yeah if you escape from a country where there's trauma
(09:22) and impending danger then your son squanders an opportunity you might get a little anxious about that 100 i mean my dad came here with a thousand dollars you know a medical degree yeah and then built every didn't even speak english right i think what he did was harder than what i've done like i got to i got to stand on his shoulders okay you know in huawei i mean i speak english you know like just the basics like i speak english i went to a good school just all the support infrastructure known and unknown that was around me
(09:53) yeah to you know to be successful yeah i think it's healthy to recognize your privilege yeah but at the same time you know it came with lots of baggage too and so you had signals which were mainly fear-based yeah and i i mean the biggest thing that made the decision for me i would say i had the logical decision and then i had the emotional decision the emotional decision was um i could i don't want to do this this is not the life i want to lead um i am not happy doing this every day i would prefer to not be alive if this is
(10:22) what my life will be continuously if i would prefer to not be alive then that kind of opens up my decision calculus and what was it i'm trying to put my finger on what what was it that made you happy was it just the freedom to do what you want i didn't know what made me happy i knew it was not making me happy okay yeah so i think that's another important lesson too if i can just extract them you know i'm sure a lot of people watching they feel the same kind of family pressure um they want to be what other people expect them to be if
(10:46) you know if that's who you are and that's totally normal um but we should always remember the context in which that advice is given could be given through the lens of a certain lifestyle a certain time frame but like i think that's a thing whether you're young or middle age you're trying to figure out what you want to be when you grow up you're trying to have it all figured out yeah because we don't seems like we don't like uncertainty but i think your message if i'm hearing you is sometimes you have to try it on for size
(11:19) to see if it fits or not and you get it on you're like well i thought that dream job was going to be like perfect but turns out you know it's tight in the crotch you know it's like i i need something different mm-hmm and i think giving yourself permission to do that and it was a side to what you were saying about my dad like education saved his life like he was only able to leave the country because he was educated and so there's very deep roots there and i can appreciate that but for this context or for my life it
(11:46) just wasn't appropriate right and when we did come to terms later um the only time he's ever apologized to me in my life and said but to be fair in my time i would have been right oh absolutely and he would have been it's just not the same time yeah absolutely it wasn't that it was inappropriate it was just out of context and it didn't necessarily translate to this new life i love the saying you know in our 20s we're concerned about what everyone thinks about us in our 40s we don't care what anyone thinks about us and in our
(12:13) 60s we realized that no one was thinking about us to begin with right and i just i just feel like that's i mean who else have you thought about today besides yourself probably not i mean you have your kids which is an extension of yourself but you know i feel like yeah not a lot and so most people are like that and you know a lot of it like we have a lot more leeway than i think we give ourselves credit for and i think the more that i have now you know i'll say accomplished with quotes in in material success the
(12:36) more i am excited about the things that i can do and that was why the opening of the book was like there are no rules and it just took me a very long time to realize that and i continued to unlearn rules that i thought existed you know as i continue to you know go on this journey yeah i love that idea of unlearning i think we all just try and go back to being like we were when we were children just because when you're a child you're purely present right you're just present in the moment and i i don't like the word happy very much i prefer
(13:02) using joy because you can be you can mourn joyfully right because it's it's a it's a it's internal rather than happiness which i feel is more like happenstance it's more from external and so um you know what are the things that bring me joy were the things that i find you know to find joy in um and i think for anyone who's listening it's a much harder question to answer what are the things that bring me joy than answering the question what are the things i hate and it's easier to correct those first you're like well i hate my job and i
(13:32) hate my relationship and i hate the city okay those are all very changeable and a lot of times you get there by by inversion well if i wanted to destroy my life i wanted to have the worst life possible what would i do and then taking all those things that you would do to really destroy your life and make your life miserable and then reverse them it's a much easier way to solve the positive psychology equation in my opinion yeah i love that and i'm remembering this this picasso quote which is i think he said everyone is born an artist yeah right
(14:00) and then eventually we you know get convinced that we're not yeah and we have to really just strip away and get you know get back to basics

How the ULTRA WEALTHY get loans to buy cool stuff... - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video i'm going to talk to you about the number one strategy of the ultra wealthy to avoid taxes and get the lowest interest rate loans humanly possible or even imaginable or fathomable to humans if you don't know hi my name is austrian moses i own acquisitions.com it's a portfolio of companies over 100 million dollars a year i make these videos because i'm insane and i like being in wife beaters in a closet i'm kidding i make these because a lot of people are broke and i don't want you one of them i too was
(00:20) broke for a very long period of time and it sucked and so i hope that we can at least attenuate that situation so that you can then ask the larger questions of what is even worth it to begin with and you can come to those conclusions on your own that being said how do i get one to two percent loans or as they call them margin right loans on margin uh to buy right or buy more assets or whatever all right so quick overview of what this topic is you've heard me maybe talk about this in other videos which is like if you have let's say 100 000 in
(00:46) stocks okay you have 100 000 in stocks depending on who you work with if you work with a more established bank and you have a longer relationship with them let's say you you know bank or you do wealth management with merrill lynch you will have a banker and they will tell you how to do this but i'm guessing that if you ask the question you're curious you click on this video you don't have that all right so those banks will typically give 50 60 sometimes 65 of the total assets in your portfolio as a asset-backed loan which is a
(01:11) margin-based loan right and so that means that if i had a hundred thousand dollars and i had 65 that i could take as a loan then i could get an additional 65 000 at one to two percent which is crazy mind you the interest rates can change over time but for the you know for a very long period of time it's been one to two percent all right which is very very very very low and the nice thing about this is that there's no closing costs there's no fees there's no startups there's no nothing you just pay the interest while you hold the money
(01:32) and all you have to do is pay back and then your interest payments stop all right so it's nice as a revolving credit line for stuff that you want to make a quick purchase and then give it back right that is how it's you do buying on margin right that's that's where the term comes from many of you guys have asked how do i actually do this great question so what we're going to do is we're going to travel together through the the realms of time and we're going to use this new mystical mystical thing and i want to i want to teach this
(01:53) process to you because i think that it's very very valuable it'll also serve you for answering any of the questions that you have in your life google alright so take loans against stocks let's see here oh look it looks like there's a lot of people who are willing to do this for us let's see if alex did something ahead of time he sure did we clicked this guy and let's see what it says they explain a little bit more how useful and if i wanted to borrow on margin apply for margin that's all you have to do and if you're like well i don't bank
(02:20) with fidelity well i'll bet you that wherever you bank they do this now let's say uh robinhood margin margin oops margin loans there we go let's look here what is margin investing let's click they give us an answer unless it deposits blah blah blah you can upgrade to robin hood gold that's how we have to do it and that will allow you to then borrow on margin and so all you have to do is sign up upgrade to robinhood gold let's see what it does all right and so the reason i do this is because sometimes i get questions that
(02:49) have answers that are googleable and so please for the love of god one of the best ways to stay poor is to have a question and then not google the answer post a comment in something and then say well i guess i scratched my itch i asked the question no find the answer right and so the reason that this by margin-based loans and things like that are useful is that they are tax-free all right so if you wanted to pay for stuff and this is what the ultra wealthy do when they go ipo and they've got a billion dollars worth of stock in
(03:12) something they just take loans against those stocks they don't have to pay income tax they take loans against the stock they buy stuff and the amount that the stock goes up year every year exceeds what they borrow they can borrow more and then keep doing that until they die and never pay taxes all right that's how this works now the risks so the risks of doing this are that let's say for some reason you borrowed at and i think uh there's other ones there's like m1 finance i think is one that i that i heard of that does up to
(03:37) 35 and the percentages will vary based on the size of your portfolio how long you've been doing business blah blah blah right and so it's usually 30 to 60 ish all right and so let's say that you took out a 60 you maxed this puppy out right on your hundred thousand dollars let's say that your portfolio because of a crash in the marketplace drops to 50 000 so you took 60 right and now your portfolio is worth 50.
(03:59) well to to to be in accordance with the the risk tolerance that they have you need to be 60 of the new 50 000 value which means that's 30 000 is what you're allowed to borrow which means you have to pay back the 30 of the 60 that you borrowed originally and if you don't have the money they sell your crazy i know it sucks that being said that is the risk and that is why people lose their asses on margin now as a quick transition to this the reason um and you might ask alex do you borrow a margin i have in the past i have also
(04:31) repaid it back quickly i tend to use margin for very short-term type things so like six months 12 months transaction stuff so like if i do like private lending for hard money loans things like that that's a perfect thing for me so it's like if i'm making 12 or 15 or 20 on the money from a hard money loan i can borrow at one to two and i know i'm gonna get paid back and the money that i'm lending out i'm securing against another asset so if they don't pay me back i get the asset and then i can sell the asset and pay back right that's how
(04:57) i do it that being said i am not a huge like at this current moment this current juncture in time i have zero debt not even a mortgage and you may be like alex you're crazy probably probably but for me i sleep really well at night knowing that i just don't own anyone anything and for me the objective of money was freedom not more money just a side note now i do subscribe to something dave ramsey said that really resonates with me he said i'm paraphrasing that debt is a version of risk and risk if extended over a long enough time horizon
(05:24) exposes you to zero meaning you could lose it all and since life is long that means that there is a high possibility between now and the time you die that you do have one of these situations where you could get exposed to zero and for me i would rather not sacrifice what i do have and that i do want and need for more of something that i don't want or necessarily don't need because me doubling my money makes no difference in my life but me losing all my money makes a very big difference and so for me why risk something that i don't want to lose
(05:48) for something that i don't need and so for that reason i have been not a big leverage proponent in general i am very very under levered in general alright and so i have run my life that way and i focused my life on increasing the value of the assets that i have i mean just continuing to do that rather than juice everything through debt and that's just not my game personally and we still built a nine-figure net worth without any of that and so i think you can do it and maybe i'm selling which is very possible and maybe when i'm 60 i'll
(06:11) think that i was an absolute idiot for thinking that way it's very possible because you know what we learn things and we grow but as current state alex in 2022 uh april i uh i don't think that so anyways keep being awesome keep crushing mozination i hope they give you some illumination to like how do you do margin loans um my recommendation to you as a final parting words and disclaimer around this is that if you were going to partake in this in this risk okay because it is risk borrow significantly less than the limit all right so if you
(06:38) want to use the your you know borrow on margin probably 10 bar 20 tops keep it way underneath so that there's literally no way that a margin call would come up where you'd actually have to sell some of your stuff because the thing is is the moment when they get you to sell it is the moment when it's worth the least all right so you get double hosed all right so you lose the power of the money that you had and then you have to sell stuff at a massive loss all right so that's when you want to be buying and instead you're
(07:03) selling and that's what crashes markets a lot of people borrow that way and that's when they ride the bull and bear cycles and we want to be a little smarter and try not to do what everyone else is doing so that we can have what no one else has all right so mozy nation keep being awesome i make these videos because i enjoy it apparently and uh i do this because you know maybe some of you guys will crush it and cross 3 million or 10 million and uh want to work with us at acquisition.com so we can get you to 50
(07:26) and beyond so keeping awesome love you all see you next vid bye

How the ULTRA WEALTHY get loans to buy cool stuff... - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video i'm going to talk to you about the number one strategy of the ultra wealthy to avoid taxes and get the lowest interest rate loans humanly possible or even imaginable or fathomable to humans if you don't know hi my name is austrian moses i own acquisitions.com it's a portfolio of companies over 100 million dollars a year i make these videos because i'm insane and i like being in wife beaters in a closet i'm kidding i make these because a lot of people are broke and i don't want you one of them i too was
(00:20) broke for a very long period of time and it sucked and so i hope that we can at least attenuate that situation so that you can then ask the larger questions of what is even worth it to begin with and you can come to those conclusions on your own that being said how do i get one to two percent loans or as they call them margin right loans on margin uh to buy right or buy more assets or whatever all right so quick overview of what this topic is you've heard me maybe talk about this in other videos which is like if you have let's say 100 000 in
(00:46) stocks okay you have 100 000 in stocks depending on who you work with if you work with a more established bank and you have a longer relationship with them let's say you you know bank or you do wealth management with merrill lynch you will have a banker and they will tell you how to do this but i'm guessing that if you ask the question you're curious you click on this video you don't have that all right so those banks will typically give 50 60 sometimes 65 of the total assets in your portfolio as a asset-backed loan which is a
(01:11) margin-based loan right and so that means that if i had a hundred thousand dollars and i had 65 that i could take as a loan then i could get an additional 65 000 at one to two percent which is crazy mind you the interest rates can change over time but for the you know for a very long period of time it's been one to two percent all right which is very very very very low and the nice thing about this is that there's no closing costs there's no fees there's no startups there's no nothing you just pay the interest while you hold the money
(01:32) and all you have to do is pay back and then your interest payments stop all right so it's nice as a revolving credit line for stuff that you want to make a quick purchase and then give it back right that is how it's you do buying on margin right that's that's where the term comes from many of you guys have asked how do i actually do this great question so what we're going to do is we're going to travel together through the the realms of time and we're going to use this new mystical mystical thing and i want to i want to teach this
(01:53) process to you because i think that it's very very valuable it'll also serve you for answering any of the questions that you have in your life google alright so take loans against stocks let's see here oh look it looks like there's a lot of people who are willing to do this for us let's see if alex did something ahead of time he sure did we clicked this guy and let's see what it says they explain a little bit more how useful and if i wanted to borrow on margin apply for margin that's all you have to do and if you're like well i don't bank
(02:20) with fidelity well i'll bet you that wherever you bank they do this now let's say uh robinhood margin margin oops margin loans there we go let's look here what is margin investing let's click they give us an answer unless it deposits blah blah blah you can upgrade to robin hood gold that's how we have to do it and that will allow you to then borrow on margin and so all you have to do is sign up upgrade to robinhood gold let's see what it does all right and so the reason i do this is because sometimes i get questions that

Leveling Up Why We Get Stuck (ALEX HORMOZI) - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) the character traits that must be associated that you learn as you go right because these character traits are things that have to happen in order for these skills to be consistently executed and so it's first you develop the skills right at a proficient level then you dive deep on those skills so that you get better and better at them and typically that comes through consistent execution and repetition which means that it takes the character traits of focus and determination and drive right and being able to be consistent
(00:32) and not go like go away and start looking at shiny objects looking at chinese objects looking at a new opportunity looking at this other side hustle you want to do whatever it is right because there's always new things and what's crazy about this is that the higher up you go the more seductive the woman in the red dress looks like and i'm saying that from matrix is my all-time favorite movie um the woman in the red dress i'm using this as a as a parable or whatever a visual for opportunity and when you're starting out the woman in
(01:00) the red dress always looks attractive and the thing is is that the higher up you go the more pretend she becomes now if you're a girl then i don't know a guy in a red suit whatever i don't know maybe that looks more like a pimp said forget about that but whatever you know george clooney or whoever your person is whatever you my point is um like i thought that i was having discipline and saying no to a certain level opportunity when i was starting my gyms right and i had to develop that discipline and then we started and then we started
(01:29) making a few million dollars a year and i was like okay i need to develop a new level discipline because there's more things that i want to do that i have to not be able to do right one of the biggest successful things i did was not start the supplement company until a year and a half after almost two years after gym one started all right i had planned starting the supplement company at the same time as i started gym launch original three and a half four years ago like they were at the same time i wanted to do both and layla the angel that she is
(01:58) was like no that's stupid don't do that and so she thankfully was like you have to have you have to stay focused and so because of that we were able to have the explosive growth that we did and then at the right time we were able to bolt that on now um big big big big picture i don't know if i would have done it again i still probably would have stayed even more focused on gym launch if i could do it all over again now we have it you know we we write a check for 600 000 every single month to our gym lords uh in
(02:27) terms of commission check so that's real money that i get to send back to the community and that's very fulfilling fulfilling for me um and it solved the problem that i always had when i have my gym so like there are reasons that i did it um and uh and so like history will tell whether it was the right call or not um i can never live the life of what it would have been if i hadn't done it um but i think if i were going back in time knowing what i've known now i might not have done it um but you never know so i'm telling you
(02:52) like i've i've made these mistakes you know what i mean and the thing is is that that level of opportunity looked even more seducting or seducing or whatever the word is um when we had two years more of a distribution base compared to when we had at the beginning and so i wasn't able to say no to her that opportunity later on as i was in the beginning and that was a deficiency in my skill set at the time my character trait of staying focused right and so um like i'm saying all this if you're looking at it in terms of in
(03:25) verticals the first step is filling the holes and that's stacking all the skills together so you can get the first dollar to go over and that's just becoming proficient not amazing just proficient you don't have to be an expert at running traffic you just need to be able to actually know how to run an ad and the thing is is that most proficient skills only take like like not a lot of time like you can google how to do x and if you consume for like two hours of information you'll probably be proficient most people just don't
(03:51) take those two hours to do it because it's uncomfortable and you're not good at it right so you consume the information and then you try right and then you fail because you're not good at it you learn and then just use those first initial tries you learn more in your first 20 sales than you do in the first 20 hours of learning about sales stuff right you first time you actually step in the ring you learn more about fighting than you do during all the time that you're practicing right because it's real right so you're
(04:15) developing you're stacking your skills and you're becoming proficient at it next step you have to do repetition and be we being willing to get punched in the face over and over and over again right so that you can deepen those skills and that's what amplifies the skills that you have so that you can get to another level then as you get to another level then your character traits need to be strong so you can stay the course all right like the biggest thing in the book uh by angela duckworth called grit which is really interesting um is that
(04:43) the people who are most successful in life just stick with it like greatness stick-to-it-ness is what it is so it's how likely are you to abandon a certain path to pursue another thing right and the people in the beginning have very low stick within this entrepreneurs shiny objects shiny object shiny object they're jumping from opportunity to opportunity and they never give any of the opportunities a chance to be successful so one of the interesting things that maybe you can think about in terms of a quote you can take with you
(05:10) is you can be successful anything you want just not everything you want all right that was a huge lesson for me all right i had a i had a friend from high school who reached out who had a contracting business and a roofing business and they were flipping houses so it's three separate businesses and i was like dude like like what do you wanna help with and he was like i don't know like what do you think i should do and i was like pick one he's like well we're making money in all three of them and i was like cool
(05:36) pick one each one of those businesses can be a billion dollar business you can be a billion dollar roofing company you can be a billion dollar flipping homes company you can be a billion dollar general contractor there are examples of each of these things right but you just can't be a billion dollars in all of them and so there's a fallacy that we tell ourselves as entrepreneurs which is that if i do more things i will make more money when in fact i need to do fewer things to get to where i want to go and the reason i can tell you that
(06:00) it's the truth is because you naturally think the other way and that's what most people think which is why most people aren't successful right it's they they can't focus because there's too many things it's just so easy just add this one thing you do this other thing and all of a sudden you're two spread thin you're not focused on amplifying the things that you're doing to get better you're not deepening the skills you're spreading yourself there right and so once you acquire the skill set once you become proficient then you amplify the
(06:22) skills that you have by deepening them and in order to deepen them you have to have the character traits of sticking with it being patient being focused learning to say no and doing things over and over again and accepting the fact that it may take years it will take years in order to become to break through the next level of proficiency because when you were developing a skill um let me give you an example with to to tie this as an analogy for fitness the amount of effort that it takes to maintain muscle versus the amount of effort it takes to
(06:54) make muscle as you become more advanced dramatically increases and what's interesting is that there's this big area of no man's land between enough to maintain and enough to break through and create a new stimulus for growth there's this huge area in the middle and most people just work out above minimum effective dose but below the threshold that it takes to adapt all right and so when we focus or when i focus on trying to get swole and trying to gain more muscle i try and go all the way to the other end to break my body the point that it has
(07:23) to adapt and get better right and so with the same thing with skill sets is that there's a minimum effective dose and then there's a whole bunch of area in between where people do stuff enough but not enough to get better but still like they could take the extra time allocate it towards deepening a skill and going all in on it um it and really push that forward and really deepen it rather than just consistently maintaining where you're at and you can know if you're maintaining where you're at because if your level of income has
(07:48) stayed the same for a period of years that means your skill set has stayed the same and if your skill set has stayed the same it's usually because you lack the character traits in order to deepen those skills to amplify the revenue and to amplify your skill sets so that you can make more all right so um i hope this makes sense uh this was like one of the one of the many things that i'll probably talk about after um the summit um so leveling up why we get stuck and it's because the things that you need to improve on are different all right in
(08:14) the beginning it's skills but then you have to change your lens and then after that it becomes traits right it becomes character traits and those are very different to level up right because everyone just always assumes it's going to be linear the same way and that's why people get stuck is because the actual thing that you need to improve changes right not just skills but the actual nature of the change itself changes uh which is pretty cool and sometimes the skill itself is to not do other things right sometimes the skill
(08:42) itself is maintaining the course and that is the skill that is the thing that you need to do to get to the next level is to do less and it's remove constraints so i hope that makes sense for you i hope you enjoyed that if you did like this and you're listening on the podcast drop a comment drop a like um if you think someone else will listen to it tag them tag your friends hope you have an amazing day and lots of love as always keep being great [Music] you

A BILLIONAIRE taught me how to think like a BILLIONAIRE.. - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) when i was in the beginning of my entrepreneurial career i would read a book on delegation right and as soon as i read the book i was like okay this is how you delegate and then i would come back to the team and be like all right delegate delegate delegate delegate delegate right and i'd be like all right y'all are good and then i would dip out and then you know we all kind of know how the story is probably going to go uh me being super excited about uh business and thinking that things are gonna you know auto things are gonna run
(00:24) themselves right now that i've delegated everything i'm a big boss man and then of course i check in a few weeks later and then things weren't done the way i wanted to and then of course you know i read super you know a bunch of books on management etc and then i dive super far and start micromanaging everyone trying to control everything and then yet again the problem would arise where people were not doing what i wanted them to do but for different reasons because they felt completely stifled they wouldn't take initiative
(00:49) because they felt like they needed my sign off and everything and then i'm basically a huge bottleneck in the business yet again but in a different way and so i say that um to illustrate uh one of the the thinking frameworks that has served me well and i'm actually really excited to talk about this because when i when i talk to people i think a lot of people think that i'm told that sometimes i communicate some ideas well and so what i wanted to do was provide you the frameworks for thinking through thoughts and i know
(01:13) that sounds crazy but i'm going to give you four different frameworks that work really well for me i'll try and give you examples of each one of them so the example that i started with that little story right is an example of something where most people try and solve how much management versus uh you know should i delegate or should i manage right and instead of thinking of it as a problem to be solved it is instead a dichotomy to be managed as in micromanaging is not good on this extreme and you know complete delegation
(01:42) on this side is not good either way right abdication and so there's a middle ground and so what's interesting about this is that um there are a lot of different things that come up in the business world where i will see people conflate or mistake what thing they are solving right and most times when i'm talking to a new entrepreneur or even a more established entrepreneur and they reach out for help or guidance or whatever right or it's one of our portfolio companies most times they'll start talking right really fast about all this stuff to try
(02:12) and provide context and i'll just usually pause them and be like what problem are we solving it usually gets them to stop right and i would highly advise you if you're if you're dealing with if you have subordinates or you have direct reports who roll into you and they have a whole bunch of decisions a lot of times they can get caught and sometimes ourselves too we can get caught in the in the day to day the minutia and just simply pause and say what problem are we solving there's so many pieces of this that i
(02:36) want to unpack that i think are going to be really interesting for you but the first one is when you define what problems you are solving you might even have to ask the question is that a problem when some people are like well hey we're getting you know customer service complaints it's like okay understood is this something that we believe that we can reasonably eliminate is this something that is catastrophic to the business or is this something that we can kind of try and improve over time you know through systems and process
(02:58) right and so a lot of times people misprioritize problems because they perceive them as as threats to existence when in reality they are a course of doing business and things that we can constantly improve right especially if you're newer you're starting out of course your product's not going to be perfect yet right you're just getting going but you improve these things rather than thinking i have to stop everything to fix this problem right and so the first frame shift is that most people think in terms of like i have a problem to solve
(03:24) rather than a dichotomy to be managed as in these are two things that will always exist all right i'll give you a different example of this um actually this will be a fun one the reason we will probably never have people who are all happy about a tax code is because you cannot have both fairness and equality equality means everyone pays 10 fairness means the rich people pay more than the poor people that's fair this is equal both are ideals and yet somehow they're not the same thing and yet both are right and so
(03:54) because of that we will always have this conflict it's the same thing between justice and mercy both of them are ideals both of them are right and yet somehow they're conflicting and so we we we see these situations and this is why i'm trying to hopefully give this to you because the more i started to recognize these patterns the more quickly i could recognize them and then identify them and then either dismiss them or say oh it's another one of those right it's a pattern recognition it's like oh you guys are spending all this effort trying
(04:21) to solve a problem that is unsolvable this is a dichotomy that must be managed and will never be eliminated and so i think what my goal with this video is if i can help you get out of these little mental hamster wheels uh it's been incredibly valuable for me all right so that's the dichotomy that's like one of the one of the things that people will mistake they'll mistake a dichotomy for a problem that needs to be solved all right another framework um that that i find immensely valuable is the concept of of of a continuum
(04:51) versus a binary all right this is probably one of the biggest mental errors that people make when they're trying to identify things this is what i mean by that so for example i might say i'll use a weight loss example so people will say something like uh i'm off my diet or i'm on my diet right it's a very simple thing and that's because psychologically we like to be binary we like to label things as yes or no but biology and reality exists on continuums as in to what extent did you go off of your diet right did you go 200 calories over
(05:23) overall you go 500 calories over and as even though it is quote more difficult to think in this way it is also more accurate and so our brain uses binaries as placeholders for decision making to store data right when in reality when you start storing all these binary decisions they start adding up and you start getting more and more unaccurate if that's a word on your decision-making process because you're actually basing your decisions not on facts but based on binary shorthand that your brain saves and so that is one of the biggest
(05:52) mistakes that i see all the time in thinking in entrepreneurs and really in anything in general because we like to have that shorthand it is easier right it's easier to say i fell off my diet or i am diabetic when the reality is it's not whether you are a diabetic it's how diabetic are you right kind of interesting i stole that from dr cashy but i just love that um who's my closest friend he's a biochemist and we talk about this stuff all the time point being if you can think about this within um i'll give you i'll give you a
(06:18) business example so if we have a a binary where people are saying yes or no which is let's say facebook doesn't work marketing doesn't work i hear these statements all the time and you may laugh at this right but i get dms like this all the time facebook doesn't work for me marketing doesn't work for me like you can't sell this way in my business right and so people want to shorten a problem into yes it works no it doesn't work when so much of business and problem solving is understanding the nuance between where
(06:45) we're starting and where we're going and it's to what extent has facebook not worked right where is the fall off right it is not that it doesn't work it is just we only got it to work this percent right now we need to get all the way over the hump to get there but it's to what extent and i think that when i when if you if you can ask the right questions if you can see the problems as they truly are they become far more solvable and so this has been probably i just gave you two of my my best frames that i think with all the
(07:14) time all right so i'll say these again so the first uh mental lapse i'll say that i see all the time is mistaking a dichotomy that needs to be managed for a problem that needs to be solved people do this in their marriages as well right so you look at your wife right you look at your wife and you're like i need more variety right but later you're like i need more consistency and you're like we have to figure this out we need variety we need consistency it's like yes you need both right and so it's not a problem to be
(07:43) solved the dichotomy to be managed so that's framework number one the second framework between two things that i see as a problem that most people make is that they use a psychological binary to make a judgment and say yes this works no this doesn't work or yes this is this way or no that's not this way so that i can apply this arbitrary label that was made up when instead it is to what extent right it is a continuum i did not go off my diet or stay on my diet it is how far off did i go and a lot of times when we
(08:12) do that we also can stop the the mental judgment of being terrible people because we can actually approach reality which is i was 10 over yesterday so i can go 10 under today and be fine and be on track with my goal rather than oh i was off i might as well eat 19 pizzas because i'm off because that's the psychological shorthand the psychological binary of yes or no and so those two understandings have underpinned a lot of the breakthroughs in terms of how i think through things that have served me well and also when
(08:42) talking to entrepreneurs and they're trying to figure out what is wrong quote wrong with their business when in reality even naming it as a problem might actually not be the case when it is actually a dichotomy that needs to be managed or they're labeling a binary when it really is a continuum all right and so if you look at the problems that come up in your life whether they're personal whether they're physical whether they're where they're business-wise if you look at just with those two lenses first and and me
(09:08) sharing this like these are the things that like charlie munger talks about having a latticework um of mental models like how are the you know and he checks through decisions with mental models and so i want to share as many of those as i possibly can with you guys because i think um if we can think if we can be precise with our language we can precise with our thinking if we can ask the right questions we will get the right answers if you ask stupid questions you get stupid answers if you play stupid games you win stupid prizes and so my
(09:32) goal for everyone here in mozi nation is that uh we do not play stupid games and not win super prizes but instead um get exactly what we desire so that we can then ask the bigger questions of life and so anyways my name is oxford mosey i own acquisition.com we do 85 million a year in portfolio revenue uh if you enjoyed this video hit the subscribe button if you didn't i still love you either way lots of love and i'll see in the next video bye

Transcript:
(00:00) so when i was at my own gym back in the day probably eight years ago um i was really struggling right and i was traveling to come back home or something and during a layover i saw this guy that i used to go to college with and he uh he was i didn't think this guy was like that much smarter than me and like definitely like i was in some classes i was like i don't think this guy's that bright and he sits down next to me and he says uh he's like oh how's your gym i heard you got a gym and i was like oh you know it's going
(00:27) well i was like trying to be cool and he's like yeah i've got this supplement store um and i was like oh that's awesome he's like well i've got two locations now i was like oh well fancy you um and i said well what do you guys do like a month he says i don't know we do like 70 80 000 a month and i was like in supplements he was like yeah and at that moment it was like my mind broke i was like if this guy can do this i'm gonna find a way like i was like i've got this whole gym full of people and i don't sell them supplements
(00:56) and so when i came back i was like 100 committed to selling supplements i was like i'm going to figure out how to do this and every single client would walk into my facility after i would sell them our service package i was like hey buy these supplements right uh and they were like no i'm not going to and uh it felt horrible and i literally just again and again and again i just kept getting beat up and i bought all this inventory after i talked to that guy and so this cash is just sitting on my shelf and i was like i have to find a way to move
(01:22) this stuff and so one day i think i had 15 or 20 consultation sites i had sold a bunch of people into a new program that was starting and i was doing all the 101 orientations that was probably like 15 orientations deep and i just headed no after no after no after no and finally i was sitting down and this nice lady walked in and she had like a nice ring and a nice purse and i was like okay if i don't sell this woman i'm going to kill myself and so and she was like super upbeat and anybody who's ever done sales like you
(01:50) know when you see that person you're like i'm definitely closing this one like i have to close this one like this is how i pay my bills and so she sits down and i remember getting to the end of the presentation and i just said instead of my normal pitch around like hypertrophy and maintaining body mass and just a whole bunch of jargon that she would never even understand i said hey uh so with the program i was like do you want to do uh you want chocolate or vanilla for your protein and she was like which one do you like i
(02:15) was like chocolate she was like all right i'll take one of those and i was like i didn't want to scare her away so i was like uh i've got uh for the pre-workout do you want to do kiwi or strawberry i i like the kiwi she was like okay i'll do that one and i didn't want to sell any more because i was afraid that she would somehow back out and so and i didn't want her to like make any other purchasing decisions so i said do you want to just use the card you have them file and she was like yeah that's fine and then i took these off the shelf and
(02:45) i and i slid them over to her and she grabbed them and she smiled and she walked out of the facility and i made my first supplement sale and i was like holy i didn't even talk at all about what these even did or how to take them or what the benefits were i just simply asked her which one she wanted and the key was i didn't ask her whether she wanted them i asked her which one she wanted and as soon as i realized that that is when i was introduced to the assumed close all right it is one of the strongest upsells in all of business all
(03:25) right like i can't tell you whenever whenever i hear someone if there's every sales process that generates tons and tons of traffic and they're closing anywhere in the 80 plus range i usually know that it's an upsell all right and the beauty of an assumed close is that the prospect is choosing between two options that both are buying from you rather than whether or not they're going to purchase and so the beauty is if you can construct your conversations in a way that makes the sale seamless and make it assume that they're going to
(03:54) have this extra thing with your program you can immediately upsell a big big big percentage of customers whereas maybe normally you might close one out of three or one out of four or if you're really good one out of two of customers who walk in the door with an assumed close as an upsell you can sell nine out of ten nine and a half out of ten of the people that you sit in front of and you can close them at higher tickets at higher percentages and part of the reason is because in an upsell opportunity you're selling to a customer
(04:19) who already knows and trusts you right and if you pair the fact that they already know and trust you with the fact that you already have a purchase that's already happened you have their their information on file and then you simply present them with an either or option that both include buying you will typically get a huge percentage to take that option and so um this this assumed closed rapidly transformed our business i ended up making just as much if not more from the supplement sales in profit than i did
(04:46) for my actual facility uh it became a staple in all the locations that i had i was able to cover all of my advertising spends simply from the upsells and so that took all of what used to be my service revenue and just turned that into profit because i could cover all my acquisition costs simply with the upsells um i taught this to all of the facilities that we had and they ultimately use that for selling prestige labs which is the brand of supplements that we have that pays really really high margins for gyms and
(05:10) so that single experience where that lady bless her soul just said yes to the either or option is what significantly changed a huge part of my life and so anyways i hope uh you take something from that i hope there's there's something you can look in terms of your sales process in terms of something you could upsell it doesn't have to be a product it can be a service um it could be you know it can obviously be any kind of retail stuff physical products is really easy because you already sold service so a next that you want to think
(05:36) about what's the next natural thing that they're going to want to need or want or going to have to normally buy on their journey and if you're like i don't know how to find something like that you just simply look at what the normal things that a normal that a customer will buy in addition to your services as a result of the decision you know fitness is an easy one people go buy clothing uh fitness clothes they buy shoes they might buy some at-home stuff they might start downloading some apps they might get different groceries uh so
(06:00) that's food or food prepping food prep materials a crock pot like all of those things are things that be accompanied then obviously supplements and so a lot of times when a consumer makes a decision to work with you on a service side there's other additional purchases that they're going to make and if you can if you can if you can predict what those are which you should know and weave those into your sales process as an either or decision you will usually get a very big percentage to uptake and a lot of times those upsells can be all
(06:24) profit for you and even offset the entire cost of acquisition of getting a new customer so i can't even stress how how impactful this was in my life and so anyways i hope you found that valuable hope that was cool if you like this stuff you know like subscribe all that kind of jazz um and i think i've got some trainings that you can go through for free and go click do that and uh [Music] [Music] [Applause] you

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video i'm going to talk to you about biden's new proposed tax plan and what it means for us as entrepreneurs and i'll try and break down all different levels of entrepreneurs and how these things may affect you all right and so i uh made a little list uh of the of the main bullets that i think everyone should know about all right so i'm going to give you a little example of what it is what it means for us and then at the end what i'm going to do is i'm going to kind of summarize what i plan to do to kind of you know mitigate
(00:24) some of these things that are happening all right now that being said i've made other videos on taxes and taxation in general there are a handful of things here that very very deeply concern me and i'll express those when we get to them all right so let's rock and roll and if you don't know hi my name is oxford i own acquisition.
(00:38) com it's a portfolio of companies that does a hundred million dollars a year i make these videos because i think they're fun and cool and i think entrepreneurship is is awesome all right so lots of love let's see let's rock and roll so number one uh they're going to increase the top marginal tax rate to 39.
(00:53) 6 percent after 2022 no big surprise there they're just gonna make the top bracket pay more okay number two they're gonna tax long-term capital gains and qualify dividends with taxable income over a million dollars at ordinary income tax rates okay so if you make over a million bucks a year all of your capital gains are now being taxed at again 40 like i just said which double blows but you know noted do we think that's going to affect uh how people invest not as much as i think you would think because if you have no alternative you just have to continue to
(01:20) play the game because you're not going to not invest the money because of the tax you're still going to invest and then you're just going to have to pay the taxes now what i do think it will do is it will get a lot of people to not realize their capital gains because they're going to hope for a change in in leadership which is exactly what i would definitely just not sell or we recently you know exited three of our companies this last year and it was because we anticipated a capital getting out because of this but among one of the
(01:42) reasons was that we anticipated a big increase in capital gains tax and so we thought it might be a good time to recognize some of our our equity all right so next one is they're going to treat transfers of appreciated property by gift at death as taxable dispositions okay so basically normally you could you could give such at death and it wasn't taxed in this case they will be now they're going to raise the corporate income tax to 28 you know which basically bumps it back from when when trump cut it there's
(02:09) going to be tax on stock buybacks which most you guys probably don't need to worry about impose a 20 minimum on income and this is probably the biggest one this is like i mean well it'll affect me it might not affect a lot of people but it's a 20 minimum tax on income okay including unrealized gains all right which to me is one of the most insane concepts of all time and i'm gonna break down this one particularly at the end of this little bulleted list because like there's a lot of consequences that i think for lack of a
(02:35) term are [ __ ] insane but i want to break it down so you can at least you know at your next cocktail party or whatever it is like talk intelligently about it okay next one is imposed minimum term and gift requirements so it's effective on all trusts created on or after the date basically they're just decreasing write-offs there i'll cover a couple more of the big ones carried interest so the private equity guys are now going to finally pay income tax i think that's probably a good thing overall uh they're going to cap deferral of gain from 1031
(02:59) exchanges for the real estate guys uh to 500 000 per taxpayer which means like pretty much if you're a serious real estate investor you're gonna now not have that 1031 to like shelter all of your tax-free gains and if you don't know what 1031 is it's basically you sell a house you have the the profit that you have from the house if you put it into something that's similar in nature a similar type of building within a period of time like i think it's a year then you don't have to pay taxes you're basically just transferring it
(03:22) into another building and it continues and the reason they have those those uh tax treatments is because you know the government likes to incentivize people to continue to rebuild infrastructure and so real estate and buildings are a big part of that and so if they make it incentivizing for investors to uh to invest in those places then it means the country as a whole will continue to upkeep its real estate it will continue uh to just overall infrastructure continue gets built by private money right which is a good thing for
(03:46) everybody uh but they're eliminating that we're capping it for the vast majority of people who do the most of the volume they're gonna decrease uh deductions for easement transactions that's like a kind of a tax loophole around donating land and things like that and then limit the use of donor advice funds for private donations so basically their limit how much you're gonna you're gonna be able to write off off of uh donations all right there's a whole bunch of other stuff and they also uh limit the duration of generation skipping uh
(04:08) transfer tax exemptions so it's effective to all trusts which means that like for the whole concept of like i want to pass on my wealth to my to my generations what do the rockefellers do they're gonna they're gonna cut that severely if they pass this okay so this is this is the bill i think that there's there's there's obviously plenty more than what you can say in you know five minutes but i want to talk about one aspect in particular i'll i'll probably talk about too one of them's gonna be the income tax the second will be the uh
(04:33) the the corporate uh tax increase and the third will be uh the one that i'm most concerned about which is the uh unrealized capital gains tax all right so first one you know if you're going from 37 or i don't even know what it was 37 to 39.6 is it gonna make a big difference for you probably not if you're in that bracket but it is kind of like boiling a frog you know at a certain point there's only a hundred percent that someone can take but you know i've always made in my last video i talked about how like the real wealth is
(04:58) always built in growth of equities growth of the things that you're building right uh which is one of the things that they're gonna threaten which i'll get to last the second one is corporate tax right and so if you have a c corp and this is in the u.s you can leave the money that you have in the c corp and pay less tax as a result so at this point i think it's 23.
(05:15) don't quote me my account's not somewhere in there for c-corps and they're going to bump into 28. where this becomes a real issue is that if you take dividends from your company you pay income tax on the dividends like regular income tax so you're going to pay 28 and then 40. so all of a sudden this starts to like not make as much sense now the c corp structure makes the most sense if you plan on continuing to redeploy capital within the business all right so if you are playing the game of i want to increase the value of the corporation
(05:40) that i own and i'm going to so it's more efficient for me to have the corporation pay the 28 keep it and retained earnings and then redeploy it through m a capital expenses investing in you know infrastructure things like that they're going to increase the value of the business now the vast majority of the time especially if you're a small business you don't really have anything besides mergers and acquisitions and again i said small business so this might not apply for a lot of people but besides m a there's not a lot of stuff
(06:03) that you're going to replay that money for and which is why i think llcs and whatnot work for most small businesses better now once you get a little bit more sophisticated i think c corps can make more sense but you have to do a cost analysis on both in terms of how you plan on redeploying the capital so that you can in most accounting firms will be able to do a side-by-side comparison for you so you can see what your net tax implications are now i'm a big fan of not caring at the end of the day because we're gonna die about about
(06:26) taxes uh on income but if you're going to get taxed you can still be smart about it and you know just do the normal work i wouldn't i wouldn't uh you know encourage you to spend a tremendous amount of time wasting on this stuff rather than building your business because that's we're going to build the most of your wealth now let's get the last one and then alex will make two recommendations that i think are going to be highly controversial and unpopular but i think would be way more beneficial so the unrealized capital gains so this
(06:49) is kind of complicated the way they set it up all right and a lot of people are reheating and hawing about how this works but let's just say that your net worth is 100 million dollars okay now a lot of people might be tuning i'd be like wow if i'm out 100 million dollars like i won't care and you might but you might not and i'll tell you why it's like right now the reason you get to 100 million is because you believe in the american dream and you believe in the american dream because you believe that opportunity is
(07:14) endless and what happens is and this is why i'm very afraid of this particular tax is that it makes it much more difficult to attain and so what it will essentially do is is massively massively massively affect how much people can basically build their net worth too and i would more or less be okay with that from a from a cognitive you know from a from a logical basis excuse me if the capital were being redeployed through a an efficient system but the private sector deploys capital 10 times more effectively than the
(07:45) government does and so you're basically taking money out of people's hands who are very good at deploying capital and putting it into people's hands who are very bad at deploying capital people who work for the government don't normally have the best capital deployment skills uh compared to people who do this for a living and so that's like kind of like a systemic concern that i have the other one is that i think it will kill innovation because i mean i think this would be a kiss of death for the u.
(08:07) s economy and be really honest with you because we want to be at the cutting edge of innovation starting new companies etc where do you think so many of these you know really exciting you know startups software companies etc get their initial funding from wealthy people and if wealthy people no longer are incentivized to do that or massively disincentivized to do that then they just won't do it or they'll invest elsewhere on top of that u.
(08:29) s as a whole will be saving less money while all of our foreign competitors will be saving more money and will have the money going to people who are better at allocating capital than their governments and so i think it's a really really really really bad move just from an economic standpoint now mind you and i just want to be really clear i've only voted one time in my entire life and i regretted it because it was a waste of time so just i say this because i i don't think that my vote matters and everyone's like if everyone thought that way it's like
(08:53) don't worry no one not everyone thinks that way so it doesn't matter i'm not gonna like somehow make one youtube video and everyone's gonna suddenly stop voting because what happens is if fewer people started voting then the votes would matter more and more people start voting again right so it's a balancing act anyways here's how the unrealized capital gains tax will work this is me broad brushstrokes okay the the armchair uh people who read every single word of the tax proposal you're awesome i love you and you know by all means put all of
(09:15) the all of the the corrections in the comments uh but this is the general gist okay so let's say you have a 200 million dollar net worth and the 200 million dollar net worth is based on a a uh a 10x multiple of a company that you own that does 20 million dollars a year in ebitda or earnings all right i'm trying to keep this simple as hell okay so you have a 10x multiple on 20 which gives you 200 million dollars in value now how they're going to to calculate this i haven't even read into because i actually haven't been able to find it i
(09:45) googled all over i can find it but let's just say that that's how it's being calculated okay and if someone in the comments does know how it's being calculated post the formula i'm really curious so you got 20 million that's that's coming in uh as ebitda for the company that you own 100 of just for math's sake and that's worth 200 million now let's say that next year you grow the thing to 25 million even okay and with a 10x valuation that means that your company goes to from 200 to 250 million okay in value assuming you took all of the
(10:13) profit of your company as a dividend which is not likely but let's just assume again to make this simple it means that you would make 25 million dollars in income okay that's category one and then you would have taken your company from 200 to 250 million so you've got 50 million here and 25 million here so that was the net increase in your like net worth ish ish okay pre-tax ish they want everybody to pay 20 on unrealized capital gains and so that extra 50 million 20 of that would be 10 million dollars okay so that's 10 right
(10:47) to the side and then you've got your normal income tax of 40 on your 25 all right which is going to be another 10. okay which means keeping keeping math keeping math here if you paid all your taxes up front then you would pay 25 million sorry 20 million of your 25 million in taxes 20 out of 25 million in taxes it's an 80 tax rate that's really aggressive now that's assuming that you don't have some sort of tech company that doesn't make any profit because if you did have that then i don't even know what their plan
(11:17) is for that situation i think you'd have to sell stock of your own company to pay the tax on the increase and somehow get like it it would be or you'd have to take loans against your equity to pay the taxes it's really shitty the thing that they're trying to do to soften the blow here all right because i mean think about it literally be like overnight 80 tax rates and that's that's with that example that i gave right it could be it could be that's it with a really high cash flow company if you don't have a high cash flow company that's valued for
(11:43) other reasons it would basically just drain you like you just drain you entirely from all your reserves you'd have to go into debt to continue to own your company or you'd have to own less of your company to continue to run your company so you'd literally be disincentivizing the founders and innovators from continuing to grow their company because if they grew it they get taxed more before they can pay for it that being said the little special caveat that they're trying to do to make it softer is that it's it can be spread over nine years all
(12:08) right so that 10 million dollars could be spread over nine years so it'd be like 1.1 million or whatever on top of your normal income tax right but the thing is is that it will stack up right so it's like it's 1.1 so i might pay my normal you know 10 million on my 25 that i that i paid in income tax and then i'd have 1.
(12:24) 1 that i'd start paying towards the 10 million that i owe on the 50 million dollars the thing is is that it sounds it sounds like okay that's not that's not as bad it's just because no one can think in time right because you just fast forward 10 years and then you're going to be paying that it just they're just they're just slowly bullying the frog to get to the point where where it stacks up on top itself because next year you're going to owe 1.
(12:45) 1 and another probably more than that because if the company grew again you'd have another you know tax bill you'd have to pay on top of that and so hopefully you're seeing it's like mount it's like mountains of debt basically in tax that you're gonna have to start paying and so nine years from now that's when you're you're you're getting smashed right because it's going to take nine years for these payment plans to stack now obviously that's one assuming that they pass it to that they don't repeal it i think the likelihood that it passes is low but i will tell you this i
(13:09) think it is one of the scariest tax bills i've ever seen and it's because if you disincentivize the very people who are building the things that grow this economy it makes the risk that a founder takes on virtually untenable it's like when you start a company you risk failure and you have the the odds are stacked against you that you will fail like it's very likely that you're going to fail and in the in the off chance that you actually succeed they will unless you just have a very normal boring cash flow business which many
(13:39) businesses are not that way that have tremendous value they will basically just bankrupt you and la and stack so much tax debt on you for things that you have not realized yet and here's where it gets worse what if you do that you pay taxes on capital gains that are unrealized and then the company goes under which is also very common you basically just paid taxes to the government on stuff you never got ever and those taxes might actually be the thing that destroy the business because you got saddled with that you could
(14:04) barely pay your own expenses so the example i gave was a generous one because a lot of times you're not going to have you know 25 million dollars a year that's coming in let's say you have i'll give you a different example to really drive this home let's say you had an exit and you have a hundred million dollars okay let's just say that that's your your current net worth and you're probably pretty good at making money or allocating capital because you have that money right and so let's say you get 15 on that your net worth goes up by 15
(14:32) million and let's say that because you had your you know exit you know you only make two million bucks doing consulting stuff whatever so you make two million dollars and you get taxed 40 so that's 800 000 but then you make 15 million dollars in increased appreciation on your assets so the 20 minimum tax there would be three million dollars on the 15.
(14:54) that's more than you made in total and people like well it's gonna spread over nine years it's like yeah but then next year you're also gonna have to pay it and then the night you're after that so like it's going to stack up and people just can't [ __ ] do math you have three million dollars in taxes and you only made two million and you still have the 800 so you have 1.
(15:09) 2 million left and you still owe another three so you're going to have to come up with 1.8 million dollars every year just because you happen to own stuff and have a successful exit and so then you start bleeding your 100 million that you risked everything to get in order to pay off tax for gains you haven't realized so you have to sell stuff just you basically the government will just force you to sell your belongings or they put you in prison so i think it's um i think it is it is one of the scariest things i've ever seen i think it destroys the american dream i
(15:37) think it is against capitalism i think that the government is a terrible allocator of capital in general and they are literally one-tenth as efficient as the private sector is and so we're just going to take money out of the hands of the people who are most effective with it but that being said i understand i understand the the inequality that exists at the top the difficulty that i have is the psychology around it which is it's just like every mlm every mlm in the world you know they show that they show the number one you know person and
(16:02) because of survivorship bias people think that's going to be me stats would show that it's probably not going to be but just the hope just that the idea that you could someday get there is what inspires the vast majority of entrepreneurs i think i mean at least me and i think destroying that incentive and destroying that vision of what what could happen would be a really big detriment i don't have the best solution i did say i have a couple of ideas and so these are alex's very unpopular ideas around taxation i think that and like
(16:31) people are gonna call me crazy for this but here's two very radical ideas number one is uh decrease income tax dramatically to zero percent and then have an enormous capital gains tax and the reason for that is because most people who are poor make money off of income right most people who are wealthy make money off of their invested investments and so that would be a i think more balanced way of helping you know then it would still help all of the basically if you're working you should get you'll be able to keep all the stuff
(16:59) that your hands are making for you right and i feel like that would be a really interesting balanced approach to the process right because you're basically limiting how much people can make passively from their money and forcing more people to work so that was that's that's an idea i'm sure there's plenty of holes there always are but that was just one i was like huh that would be interesting a different idea that i have is because most of you who know me know that i'm not a huge fan of the concept of legacy because you know
(17:23) you multiply out your generations 5 000 years they won't know who you are just like you don't know the people who you came from um and so the idea of legacy is kind of a myth when you expand it over a long enough time horizon and because i think that money ruins people when you have not earned it the alternative would be to have basically like 100 death tax decrease the taxes dramatically on income and capital gains throughout the entire life that someone has but basically eliminate the transfers of wealth and what that does
(17:46) is i think it will create a world where people become significantly more giving as they get older anyways because they know they can't take it with them both in the like we know we can't take it with us but for some reason we have this deluded idea that we're going to be able to pass it on to people and so i think it would force the people who know that the government is going to tax them i don't think that they would want all that money to go away and so what will happen is that in the in the end of their lives they will start giving it
(18:08) all away and then privately allocating the money where they are more efficient than the government is and actually have a massive improvement in the well-being of society as a whole and so think about that is like these these huge wealths get accumulated and then they just can't they can't just pass the generation to keep accumulating and accumulating it instead it just gets boom back and then it helps everybody else out and so that is that is actually my best is in my opinion my best idea that i have uh to
(18:34) fix the tax system which would be massively decrease income tax massively decrease capital capital gains because i would encourage investment it would encourage people to work it would mass it would increase the amount of innovation it would increase foreign money coming to the company into the united states in the country the death tax the fact that you can't transfer the wealth to you know people without you could do 100 you get 90 whatever it is right some big percentage and i'm sure you could write a little
(18:59) bit of you know clauses around like spouses directly or something like that but basically not down generations i think that would be a really cool way to incentivize everybody who accumulates a lot of wealth to end up giving it away and the key part that i think makes it interesting is that because they will give it away rather than getting it taxed they will privately allocate the money where it's more effectively spent than the government does and i think that overall would flood uh the us with pretty probably all the social systems
(19:25) that i would need um privately funded more efficiently and probably alternative educations and the things that the people who make the most money are passionate about and what's interesting here too is that the people who make lots and lots of money first generation is very very different second and third generation wealth they talk about all the time one you know one first generation builds a second duration uh maintains that their generation destroys it and the people who are builders most times i think is like 85 like don't
(19:48) quote me but i think it's like 85 of the the forbes list are self-made and so people talk about these billionaires like they're these terrible people but like they're they're one of us who just made it right and so giving those people typically i think start caring about everyone the wider up you go the higher up the the because you don't need to satisfy your needs anymore you're really just trying to help humanity at this point and so i think that you'd have the best most innovative people trying to make an impact on humanity rather than
(20:13) leaving the legacy to their very concentrated family anyways that's alex's two cents on on joe biden's plan welcome to mozzie nation if you're new most of the times i'll talk about business stuff this one was an exception if you enjoyed it let me know if you hated it also let me know keeping amazing i'll catch you guys next video bye

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video i'm going to talk to you about incentives how to get people to do the things you want and if you don't know what the definition of power is by the way the definition of power is how to influence events or people all right so the ability to direct or influence events or people that is the definition of power and so most people hopefully if you're watching this you want to become more powerful and the thing is that word makes you feel queasy on the inside it's because you have a very poor definition
(00:23) of power power is neither good nor bad what you do with it can be good or bad right it's just it is just raw potential so in this video and if you don't know who i am by the way my name is alex romozzi on acquisition.com it's a portfolio of companies over 100 million dollars a year you want to make these videos because a lot of people are broke and i don't want you to be one of them all right i also have a lot of fun doing this and so that is why i make so you want people to do stuff right there's the component of persuasion in getting
(00:44) them to believe that it is in their best interest that is fundamentally what leadership is to get someone to believe that doing the thing that you want them to do is really just get them to want to do that right that is what it is and so a lot of leadership is power which and a lot of power if you sign the definition is selling but today i'm not talking about selling i'm talking about incentives right so this is like kind of the brass tax side there's the persuasion the soft side which is still very important the psychology side the
(01:07) other side is kind of the behavioral side and so this is adapted from a conversation that i had with my closest friend dr trevor cashy and we were talking about behavior and getting humans to comply and so what i want to talk to you about is the ways to do that and so a big part of that if my my little my little doodad will start working that's what she said um here we go and we're gonna make a little boxy do boxy do fantastic boxy do completed okay so it's not a perfect box deal with it you've got pluses and you've got minuses and you can add
(01:38) them or you could subtract them what this means is that we have a combination of both punishment and we have reward stuff that people don't want and stuff that people do want all right so for example and i'm going to give a simplistic reasoning to get someone to do something so we'll use a simple one which is how do you get your kid to clean their room this is a simple example that you can extrapolate to whatever it is that you want someone else to do you can add a good thing i can give you a cookie that is something
(02:04) that i can do i can if you do the chore i will give you a cookie simple you do the thing you get the reward awesome the next thing that we could do is we could subtract a negative you get no cookies all right so they don't get to have dessert anymore which would be impossible because you can never skip dessert right like not in this family right and so we could subtract something that they do have that they like right so if you don't do your chores i will remove video games or you don't get to eat dessert makes sense so those are two things that
(02:34) we can do with a positive or a reward on the reverse of this is that we can add a negative so we can say i will spank your ass i'm going to add a negative i'm going to spank your ass if you don't if you don't do your chores oh no that sucks right but i'm going to add something that wasn't currently in your life that you will not like all right as we add a negative the fourth thing that we can do and i'll get to how you can think through these in a second we can subtract a negative okay so i can uh i plan on speaking every day and i i can
(03:03) remove spanking or let's say there's something that you uh that you don't like doing which might be like you're expected to do the dishes right you don't have to do the dishes or let's say you don't like it you know you don't like riding the bus right so you're only riding the bus i'll drive to school that's kind of like taking away negative and adding a positive ah right and so we can do no dishes which would be subtracting a negative think about these in this way these are things that people want to avoid and these are people
(03:28) things that they want here's what's kind of interesting about all of this stuff incentives drive behavior there's tremendous amount of documentation on that hopefully you're not going to fight that point with me all right but here's what's interesting when you create punishments for people people do anything to avoid the punishment which may not mean doing the thing that you want them to do so for example if your child sneaks out at night and then you punish them for sneaking out the incentive is not necessarily stop
(03:51) sneaking out the incentives to stop getting caught right it encourages criminal behavior it encourages people to find new and ingenuitive ways to do the thing they want to do which is their incentive their plus side and figure out a ways to avoid the downside here's what is kind of interesting about this is that with punishments in general you get people to avoid the behavior but you don't get them necessarily to do what you want them to do so if you want someone to do something it's much easier to incentivize that if you do the thing
(04:17) right you get this right because incentives direct behavior punishments force people to avoid anything that will give them the punishment it's subtle but hopefully you're picking up what i'm putting down the reason this i think is very interesting is that when you look at so jim collins uh wrote a lot of the best management books that are out there and what's interesting if you if you if you follow his career it seems like he's he went from super super quantitative to more qualitative now he still did quantitative to arrive at his
(04:42) qualitative decisions but he talks about how leadership is such an important part of building great businesses and we know that great people build great companies okay and so we as entrepreneurs must be leaders and good people so we can attract good people so we can build good companies now a big part of that is figuring out how to get people to do stuff and so based on the research that he had that he had presented which i thought was really fascinating is that over time if you have negative reinforcement performance degrades right
(05:07) it's always critical feedback always critical feedback always negative only only talk to somebody when they do something wrong on the flip side if you have positive feedback by large majority of the time performance improves isn't that interesting and so i saw that through this lens which is we can we can direct people's behavior far more effectively with positive incentives than we do with negative stuff which has huge implications for like the jail system and the punitive system and all that stuff is like people just find ways to
(05:33) avoid punishment they don't necessarily do what people want them to do because it's much because punishment it just people can the the the activity sprays in any direction that's just away from the thing whereas incentives directs it towards what you want all right and so if we think about this this within the context of managing people and getting to do the things that we want them to do then it makes more sense for us to add to to think about an activity rather than a single outcome into as many many many many incremental steps as we
(05:59) possibly can and then incentivize those mini steps and the incentives don't necessarily need to be monetary in fact most times they don't need to be monetary they need to be things that people can perceive as positive outcomes which many times is just status and feedback which is just great job awesome stuff you did that thing yesterday and it was great you just reinforce the things that they are doing that are good and we reinforce and then now that they've realized i did this one thing not anything to avoid something but i
(06:24) did this one thing and i got this cookie well i want to do that one thing again and then get another cookie right and we reinforce behavior and so i like this this process of thinking and trev and i talk about this a lot because it gets around the hullabaloo of trying to figure out what's going on inside of people's heads right and what we have instead are circumstances and the outcomes right and then we have our incentives and all of these things we can measure we can say i saw that this person we were in this
(06:50) circumstance which you can measure we inserted uh this incentive and then they did this outcome yes or no right whether they felt inspired or whether they psychologically loved we don't know and we never will know because not everyone even knows how they're feeling and whether they answer questions is not necessarily even true we have no idea but if we can just measure the conditions then we can start directing behavior in the right ways and so i thought this was a fascinating topic for getting others and this applies to
(07:15) spouses how do you get your spouse to do the stuff that you want them to do it certainly doesn't come from nagging them all the time all they're going to do is try to avoid being nagged hmm interesting right and so this gives you four boxes to look at the the these two oh you can't really see them but it was this one this box over here this guy and this guy those are things that you can't really direct people's behavior as much whereas this guy and this guy you can direct people's behavior to the singular outcome that you're looking for and you
(07:39) continuously reinforce those behaviors such that they start doing them without even thinking about it because it has been so reinforced right and so instead of trying to think how do i how do i have an amazing marriage it's how can i condition this person to stay married to me kind of interesting little flip for you so anyways mossy nation this is the kind of stuff that i do out on and i think it's really interesting um i hope you enjoyed it as much as i enjoyed making this for you this is how you get people to do
(08:04) you can think about it in the sermons the soft side in terms of persuasion but you can also think about in terms of the hard side of what are the the reinforcements that we're going to use either positive or negative and we're going to add positives we're going to remove positives we're going to add negatives are going to remove negatives so that we can accomplish what we want together so lots of love buzzing nation let me know if you like this stuff in the comments and keeping awesome i'll see you guys next video bye

4 Steps to Maximizing Revenue Generated Per Customer - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UvmyixFszw

Transcript:
(00:00) wanted to talk to you about a cash flow process that i've i've been consistently walking through for the last couple months part of this started with the book that i'm still currently working on called building a better mousetrap and all of that is around how you can increase how much money you make per customer that comes into your business and so the easiest way to know if you have an issue um is thinking about this single question so i'm dealing with a lot of agencies on our software side and what i'm essentially walking them
(00:29) through is a cash flow quadrant but not the same cash flow project that you'd have in like robert kiyosaki's rich dad poor dad but a cash flow quadrant for how you can increase the value per customer because fundamentally um it's my viewpoint that if a business cannot pay a hundred dollars or two hundred dollars to get someone in the door they don't have a marketing problem they have a business problem right they have a cash flow issue and they don't know how to acquire customers and make cash flow up front and so what i'll do is i want to
(00:57) walk you through the four-step process that i look at when i'm looking at a customer that's coming in the door and that doesn't matter what they're coming in on they could come in on a a free offer they could come in on a lowberry offer like a a new client special or something like that that's a 29 i think 21 doesn't really matter or it could be a straight up value offer where there's no discount whatsoever there's no no free no nothing um simply value being provided so those are fundamentally the three types of
(01:22) offers that exist in the marketplace free discount and value right but all of them can still lead to the same mousetrap right and so the first thing that i'll look at is products right is there something that we can add on in this sales choreography when someone comes in the door so we can immediately add a product purchase to bolt-on to additional to an initial service package right so initial service package could be x period of time x number of sessions uh or a single session done at a discount or even a single session free like an evaluation
(01:52) or or whatever right the point is is and this works in any industry right you could come in and obviously in the gym and fitness space the next natural cell for products would be supplements right uh if you were in a a chiropractors clinic the next natural cell might be orthotics or a special pillow or some sort of brace or whatever right it's a physical product someone can immediately purchase from you at a very high margin specifically to go with the service that you're also selling them another example might be
(02:20) if you're in the beauty space you might sell uh masks or serums or creams all of those things would be the first quadrant of how you can increase how much you make per customer right so let's say i'm going to use 100 as the average like if you can't pay 100 for every person who walks in the door in your marketing then you're not going to have a business right you can't make if you can't make a hundred dollars on a customer's coming in a service-based business you're not going to succeed and has nothing to do with your market it's
(02:44) because you don't have this process down so even if they come in for free boom you sell 100 200 per person in product all right you've already broken even on that but if you still want to really beat and dominate everyone in the market you go to the second quadrant which is how can i get them to add on additional services right so this might be introducing them to uh upsells within your core offer so if you were a facility the gym facility for example you might have your large group training but you might also have
(03:12) accountability nutrition coaching um semi-private training all of those things would be add-ons to the initial core offer all of this will increase the average lifetime value and investment of the new customer that's coming in which allows you to make more money all right that's in a gym space if you were looking at a med spa someone comes in for a botox you know treatment or whatever first thing you're going to do is try and get them to buy a package that's more of the same thing but then also give them what i would consider a menu
(03:41) close which is let me show you what other things we have to offer we have coolsculpting we have filler we have microdermabrasion we have skin tightening we have whatever right all of those things would be showing them what other services and offerings you have for that exact customer so that they can so that they can become more valid you and that you can become more valuable to them right so cash flow quadrant number one is product cash flow quadrant number two is add-on services number three is more from a uh
(04:10) for somebody who's more capital constrained and wants to make more money per customer up front you can add on prepaid or financing and so if you can if you're in a really established industry you can get financing companies to do this for you care credit is massive in the healthcare industry people get you know get boob jobs finance they get anything financed through care credit right if you can establish it in your business you can get uh sometimes half or more to finance the packages that they may have purchased from you so
(04:37) the third piece there is just simply asking and offering a 10 discount to get someone to pre-pay and there's a key note there you don't say paid in full you some offer someone to prepay that's the language around that uh to drag some of that revenue up front uh or certain cash up front so that you can further liquidate the cost of acquisition now let me let me show you how powerful this is with a single math example if you have 10 people who walk in your door and let's say you sell five of them all right and one of those five does a
(05:06) prepay on your service right and let's say everybody else averaged out to 500 um for the for the initial purchase but one of them paid 2500 right that one 2500 sale increases the average ticket from 500 to 1000 across all of the customers that you had in the door so even if a small percentage take that offer it can be a massive increase in the average order value average cart value average cash per show whatever way you want to call it um and can change the game in terms of how you can acquire customers and beat out the people in
(05:39) your competitive space all right so i went for i've said three so far so product is number one add-on services number two getting people to pre-pay for services that are happening in the future number three and then number four is continuity so is there a way that we can also tie continuity into this acquisition process right so uh i'm gonna i'm gonna not do the gyms uh because everything i do is about gems so i'm gonna try and apply this in a different setting so uh let's say we have i mean a med spa is an easy
(06:08) one to use because they just brought it up so someone comes in for a discount botox right first thing there they might not make the surgeon or the med spot center might not make a lot of money in that first transaction they might make a couple hundred dollars but that should at least cover the cost per show the next thing they're gonna do is give them uh products right the products that are gonna go with that might be uh the serums the macs at home because everything that someone's coming in for there wants to look younger and more
(06:32) beautiful right and so all all the products that would go along with that would immediately be sold from like a take-home kit standpoint like if you want to maintain these results or extend these results you should have these things the next would be our menu clothes right do you want to do microdermabrasion you want to do the coolsculpting do you want to do filler whatever right then we're going to prescribe a package that's going to be their total beauty package which might take six months or whatever to get them to where we where they want
(06:59) to be and then the continuity that we're going to tie into this is a process that i like to call down selling the upsell all right and so what that is is typically you'll want to have people pay more in the beginning because it costs more to acquire a customer it costs more to onboard a customer than it does to maintain a customer and so if we're getting more cash up front for these customers they're going to be more invested in our process and it also allows us to cover the overhead of getting them activated getting them on
(07:22) board and giving them a great experience but then you can simply offer them the same thing that they've been getting but just on a recurring basis and do it at a pretty decent discount and most people will jump at that offer what it does is then locks that person into regular recurring cash flow for the business and then massively extends the lifetime value of the customer and so i'm going to walk you through one single math example that i'll sign off but hopefully you can look at that quadrant within your existing sales process and
(07:50) say how can i implement each of these four things into the sales choreography in my business so that i can outspend my competition so that um i can spend five hundred dollars per person who walks in the door a thousand dollars per person who walks in the door and the reason that's so important is because if you can get that cash per show high enough then you can spend on multiple different channels of acquisition you can have referral partners you can have uh you can have cold traffic you can have uh affiliates
(08:16) you can have all of these different venues you can have you can have direct mail you can have uh social media stuff you can like all of these different venues cost different amounts but at a certain point all of them become affordable and that is what unlocks the huge amounts of growth that are available for a business owner and it comes from the back not the front and so everyone thinks they have a marketing problem but typically it's because they have a monetization issue they're not good at cash flowing or choreographing
(08:40) the the money that they're making per customer right so to to bring this all home what we're trying to figure out is how much can we make up front in the first 30 days and then what's the lifetime value of the customer the cash value for the first 30 to 60 days is going to be important for how you spend money to get them in the door the lifetime value on the back end is going to be how much money you're going to be able to extrapolate and how much revenue you make per month based on your sales volume so for example if you
(09:07) sell 20 people every single month and you know that your lifetime value per customer is 2 000 total and you sell 20 customers per month total then it means that your business should cap out at 20 times 2 000 which should be forty thousand dollars a month and that's an easy way to back into like if you feel like your business has not been able to grow it's because one of t is two numbers either you're not you're not capturing enough on the back end or you don't have a big enough inflow that is it that's all there is to it you can massively
(09:35) simplify this now if we're looking at trying to back into that number so let's take a business a that can only pay a hundred dollars per show which means they're not making a lot of money and then option b is we've got a business to pay a thousand dollars to show let's see if we can reverse engineer a thousand dollars per show uh into a business model so if someone comes in and let's make it an attractive friend and offer let's make it a let's make it a a 19 new client special whatever right evaluation it doesn't really matter what
(10:05) industry it is it works the same way all right so someone comes in for a 19 thing they show up all right from there let's say that we know that we're going to close half onto uh the next service package right now that next service package let's say the average is going to be two thousand dollars all right now that's gonna be over an extended period of time cool let's say that our minimum that we can get down is 500 because that's what we say is minimum in order to buy and that's why we're closing half and not
(10:30) 100 right the next thing we do is we sell 200 per customer now if two thousand dollars was what the package was we closed half we're at a thousand dollars in lifetime value all right just from that first transaction half times two thousand is a thousand all right now of all those people that say yes now let's say we sell each of those people 200 for the product all right now we added 200 now we're at 1200 lifetime value then let's say uh two out of those five people that we you know that we sold for example um decide to add on an
(11:04) additional thousand dollars for the services all right from your other service offerings that you have all right so now we've got two-fifths times a thousand uh which would be four hundred dollars uh that we add again to the customer so now we're at sixteen hundred dollars per show all right and then again on the back of that we say hey we know that from every of the five that we have um we can get uh let's say another two to sign owns a continuity at two hundred dollars a month and we turn out at ten percent which tax another two thousand dollars
(11:40) onto two of those customers all right and so that would add yet another eight hundred dollars on top so you'd be at twenty four hundred dollars per person that walked in the door for a free offer all right that is how you can beat everyone in your marketplace is that you consistently execute the process right it means every single time you have a choreographed handoff between service a or service one and sale number two so number two and cell number three so number three and cell number four and if part of you is like man i feel like
(12:13) i'd be selling all the time yes is the answer but but the secondary correlate to that is that if you look at the research that exists on how to maintain a customer over the long haul it's about expansion revenue it's about ascension it's about selling them more things over time so that they can continue to be reminded of the value that you provide because over time people always want new things and so it is your duty if you believe in the value that you provide to make the offers to those people and communicate that
(12:46) process in a seamless way so that every part of your business knows my objective is passing the baton from point b to point c from point c to point d and all of that choreographed process ultimately results in a front end that allows you to spend whatever you want per customer uh because your back end is so strong and that process that cash flow quadrant is the reason that jim launch has been able to stay number one in this industry despite the saturation despite the charlatans despite the many people who would claim that they're doing the same
(13:19) thing but they're not because they don't execute that process and at the end of the day what you are always going to be paid for is the value that you can create the marketplace we've been able to choreograph that process for the businesses that we serve so that they make more per customer and so that their customers are better served and that's ultimately what you have to do what we have to do as entrepreneurs and business owners is how can i serve my customer in the highest and best degree ever um and how can i do it in as seamless a way as
(13:43) possible so that i can have as little operational drag as possible so that um i can outmarket my competition and continue to play the game so anyways uh that cash flow uh quadrant is is how i think through the choreography around creating selling systems so that our gyms and our businesses can beat out their competition and i would encourage you to print that out put it put it somewhere so you can think about every single sales process that you have through that lens and i guarantee you that you'll make more money that's what
(14:17) that's what when i do my consulting days and i sell consulting hours this is the process that i walk those business owners through and nine times out of ten we can almost double or triple the amount that they make customers simply following that process so i hope that was valuable for you i hope you have an amazing saturday execute that make more money serve at a higher level and crush it lots of love catch you soon [Music] you

Entrepreneurs Get Stuck For 3 Reasons - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) if you're stuck in your business then this video will help you get unstuck so this morning i was reached out to by a business owner who's doing about one and a half million dollars a month in revenue and he was like hey man i'm kind of stuck doing what i'm doing and i just don't know anyone who's in my space who does more than two million dollars a month he's in the online marketing space and i thought that was really interesting and we had a good conversation about it and so i wanted to share um what we talked about and so the first
(00:25) thing is i completely oppose that viewpoint and i think this is so interesting because the reason we get stuck in our business is because we either have a belief that is incorrect we there's this character trait that we lack where there's a skill deficiency we don't know how to do what we need to do we don't know how to be who we need to be we don't believe what we need to believe right that's what we think about the world and so whenever i'm looking at a business or business owner or myself and i'm stuck at a certain level i think is this
(00:48) a belief that i'm lacking or that that's wrong is it a trait that i have that i need or i need to change or is there a skill right and a lot of times it depends on who you're talking to but you need all three and a lot of people who are just really good at character development only talk about traits people are really good at skill development only talk about skills and people who are kind of like a little bit more woo and they talk about beliefs but you need all three right and so when i was talking to this guy he
(01:09) said you know no one's in the online space making more than two million dollars a month and i thought this was interesting because when i came into the gym space with our first company there was no one who's making more than three million dollars a year in that space and um for those who don't know you know we grew that company to 30 million a year plus and so we 10xed what the biggest person in the space was doing at the time and so a lot of that's kind of like running the four-minute mile for the first time is like
(01:33) just because no one has done it doesn't mean it's not possible and so you know for this individual i was like we'll break it down to physics right break it down like tell me why you think that you can't get past that no one excuse me that no one can get past 2 million a month like why is there not enough customers right and he's mass market so of course there's enough customers it's like so so tell me like why can you not do it right as we're talking about this i want you to think like think about your business right
(01:59) um i get research all the time like hey i'm doing you know two million dollars a year i'm doing 5 million a year i'm doing 10 million a year i just don't think we can grow any bigger within our market now there are real market constraints right so for example if you were if you were serving chiropractors and there's 50 000 chiropractors in the united states if you had all 50 000 of them then yes you wouldn't be able to grow in that space and then at that point you could grow adjacent and so then at that point your business would still would
(02:24) continue to grow and it's normal for businesses to go vertical to vertical and expand uh horizontally in that way but in if you're in a mass market business or a business that serves consumers in any any way the entire marketplace is your base and so when he said that he doesn't know anyone who's doing over two million dollars a month that is a belief issue right i'm like well let me give you this one to think with well if you have 10 competitors and each of them are doing 2 million a month then it means that one of you
(02:48) could be better than all of you and make 20 million a month say with that for a second think about it because when i when i looked at the gym space when i got into the very beginning i looked at all of the people who were out there and i saw that all of them were doing one to three million a year and so i was like if i'm better than all of them then i should be able to do 30 million i should be able to add up all of their businesses and that should be what my business should be able to do and so if you think about like that like
(03:10) it is a hundred percent that way how much do people spend on logistics and you know fulfillment right how much do people spend in consumer can you imagine jeff bezos like in the in the early days of amazon thinking to himself like well like you just can't get past 10 million a year just can't get past 100 million a year like there are so many people the reason that people get limited is because of their beliefs and the reality is because they don't have one of those three things and so with this individual i first started with the belief i said
(03:38) do you believe it's possible that you can get there because like if we don't have that then nothing can happen right and so i was like well let's just add up all your competitors is there any reason that you couldn't just get all of their revenue right i was like well no okay cool so that one's done traits well this one is like are you are you patient enough to see it out um with which and part of that comes to the fact of like if you believe you're making a positive impact right you believe that your product or service
(04:01) really is benefiting the world which is honestly what i think one of the biggest issues is a lot of people don't really genuinely when they look at themselves in the mirror at night believe that the product is good enough and so subconsciously they do not push it further than to meet their own individual needs think about that for a second like if you if you've matched your own individual like you've you've capped out your ability to spend money and and like your ability to generate money the only reason to make more money past that
(04:24) if you're a self-aware individual is because you actually believe the thing that you have is going to help more people and so it shifts from being a self-centered focus to another center-focused process right and so that person may not have the traits or the like to have that like to do that right and the third is like he might not be able to grow because he lacks the skills like he might not have the skills of of recruiting somebody to uh open a new sales channel right he might not have the skill himself to do it or the skill to find someone
(04:50) because those are two different ways to think about it like you can always acquire the skill which is how do i do it uh or you can have the you know probably the wealthier mindset of like well who can do this right and so then you can make you can approach that but as long as you know what needs to happen then you can find the who now if you are completely unaware because i get this question all the time like what at what point do i bring someone in to like run my business for me so i had someone asked me this
(05:10) yesterday they were making i think like 50 or 100 a month i can't remember what it was and i was like dude like you're just starting you don't even mean like you're just getting into the game like what's the you know i mean like you don't need to have like is your market capped is there a reason that you like why do you want to do this right and i think it's because they didn't really believe in the thing right that they're selling because if you believe in the thing then you want to you want to be the one who's
(05:31) driving it you know and continuing to grow it over time so anyways all that to say right now if you're stuck right or you perceive yourself to be stuck i would break down is there an actual cap on how big my market is right and have i sold 100 of my marketplace i sold 30 of my marketplace and if you're in like the one percent of your marketplace or half a percent of your marketplace or 0.
(05:51) 1 percent of your marketplace you haven't capped your market you just have capped your skill or your beliefs or your traits and so then i would look at okay well if all my competitors are doing this put together then there's no reason i can't get all of that or half of that if i were way better than all of them right if you were better because each one of those businesses has a specific way they acquire customers a specific way of fulfilling those customers right and so if you knew how to do each one of those things and you did it better than them then there's no reason
(06:16) that you couldn't beat them right and so if you think about that then then all of a sudden that should break the limit that you have on how much you can actually make within your current vehicle then you get forced to look at the other two which is like is there a trait that i lack or is it a skill that i lack uh in getting to where i want to go and so this was the conversation i had with him at the end of the conversation like wow i guess i can get this thing to 10 million a month etc and i was like right and so um that was
(06:37) the entire purpose of this video is that if you are stuck and you are thinking that you are capped you might be but it's not because your market oftentimes it's because of your beliefs a trait or a skill that you lack and then figuring out which one it is and then attacking it is usually the way to go through it so anyways hope you found value in this video keeping awesome hope you like my mobile studio setup we are we're rocking the colorado mountains it's beautiful up here and i hope you guys uh are having an amazing day catch you guys
(06:59) soon bye

Biggest mistake that stopped me from getting past $30M - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) it means that people actually want the thing that you're selling which believe it or not a lot of people sell stuff that people do not want crazy i know in this video i'm going to break down why all of these mass market biz ah businesses and uh consumer product businesses plateau and so if this is you then listen up and so uh this actually stemmed from a conversation that i had uh with a big uh business opportunity business owner who's doing you know 50 60 million a year and you know they were reaching a plateau where their their
(00:24) margins were paper thin and so i wanted to break down uh the reasons why the way a mistake that you can avoid that took me a very long time to figure out and a lot of pain and so if right now you are in one of these businesses that sells to a consumer products alright so mass market or b business opportunity or c even uh services to mass market then this video is for you all right and i'm going to show you how you can avoid a mistake that you won't know that you made until it's too late alright if you don't know hi my name is alex from
(00:50) mozzie i own acquisition.com it's a portfolio of companies that over 100 million a year i make these videos because i want you to get to 3 million a year so i can partner with you that's why all right but if you're not there then i make these videos just because i want you to be rich af all right so let's walk through a logical outline of what happens in a business all right so zero to six figures all right so zero to 100k you sell something to someone that's what you have to do in order to get to 100k and usually it is unreliable
(01:13) all right so you have unreliable acquisition and usually from different channels because you don't know what you're doing all right and that's usually what it is all right so it's unreliable acquisition but you are selling something to someone now 100k to 1 million you create a reliable and usually a single reliable acquisition channel which means you pick one channel one product one avatar all right and you sell that thing that's all you do and if you do it reliably you can get to seven figures that is what happens here now
(01:35) what i'm about to show you is the mistake that most people make all right at this point we have what i would call pmf or product market fit it means that people actually want the thing that you're selling which believe it or not a lot of people sell stuff that people do not want crazy i know all right so we have product market fit now this is the point where people mess stuff up because what happens is they say hey i did this thing so if i do more of that thing that is how i will grow this business and the answer is yes
(01:59) and also no and here's why if you do more of what you do there are three variables that are logical eventualities that will occur in the business that will eventually rob you of your margins and so if this actually worked then you usually are profitable right and so you were most profitable in the beginning of the business why because you usually had to figure something out and you usually have very low overhead less infrastructure cost etc in the beginning right now in a physical products business specifically you do have some
(02:23) economies of scale that happens when you buy more stuff but those are diminishing meaning you know the first two increases in orders of magnitude of purchase size is where you get the vast majority of your savings and then after that it's razor thin in terms of how much uh savings you're going to be able to have from scale all right from increasing the quantity that you purchase all right so you're usually profitable in the beginning and you're growing cool makes sense now here's the thing these are the three eventualities that happen in every
(02:45) business that's mass market all right number one is that cpms go up over time all right they go up over time that should make sense advertising today is more expensive than it was yesterday and more expensive than it was 10 years ago right cost per impressions go up that is an eventuality that is a lot will happen over time number two is that you will have to go to colder and colder audiences which means as you scale the conversion rate that you have on these audiences will go down right if you had that one channel that you were doing if
(03:09) you go deeper on that channel you go to lesser or lesser likelihood audiences of people who are going to purchase right this is a function of scale and so you think about it like conversion goes down as you scale that makes sense now the reason that a business can scale is because they make so much money on the on the smaller audience that when they go to a larger audience they still make enough money to justify doing it but it is a logical eventuality at some point you will reach a cold enough audience that they will not buy all right and
(03:30) then the third piece is that as you scale business costs of infrastructure go up all right which means that you have higher fixed costs in the business which means your margins in a railway can't compress all right so these three things are eventualities these are logical outcomes that happen as you scale as the business progresses and does more volume all right and so if we have these three things then what happens is let's say this is our our line of of top line and let's say this is our margin line is that this starts to compress right
(03:54) here and so we start making less and less money over time even if our revenue is going up right this margin still starts to compress and we start to get razor thin why because of these three eventualities right these always happen in every business so then you're like okay alex that sounds like doom and gloom then how do i combat that well it's understanding sequence all right and so if up to this point you said okay i made a million dollars we're making two million dollars a year or whatever selling uh mass market services mass
(04:19) market products you're selling to everybody you're selling to a big big big demo all right so this is where beauty this is where uh business opportunity this is where investment opportunity this is where weight loss uh relationship coaching big mass market things right these are huge industries okay and so how do we combat it we have to have an equally strong thing that is going in the other direction that is decreasing our cost of acquisition and increasing our gross profits all right now how do we do that do that through getting the invisible
(04:45) hand to work for us which is warm word of mouth all right now before you before you look away because this is important this is the invisible hand and the reason this is so important is that as you scale right if we're in this little you know example over here and we go you know uh 1 million to 10 million right and the margin goes from you know 40 to 30 and we go 10 to 30 million we go from 30 percent to sorry from 20 to 10 margins right and this margin keeps compressing the thing is is that we need a acquisition channel that doesn't
(05:12) behave in these three ways how word of mouth is quadratic in nature meaning one person tells two two people tell four four people tell eight and so we have far more leverage on the acquisition of one customer and this process right here is what will drive down your cost of acquisition over time at scale even if you're reaching more people less efficiently than you were in the beginning which makes sense of course you'd be less efficient at the beginning less efficient at scales you are in the beginning now you might say well our
(05:37) media department's better our buyings are better our advertising is better and sure all those things happen but these three things are absolutes cost impressions will go up you will market to colder audiences who are less likely to buy your thing and the cost of infrastructure will increase those are eventualities all right and so we have to and this is the piece that everyone misses you have to pause when you're in that one three maybe five million dollar pre-year range you have to pause to do something entirely different and you
(05:58) have to stop doing the thing that got you there because continuing down that path will eventually lead to a point where you have lots of revenue and basically no margin and then you will have a hiccup you will have a mistake or you'll have something that happens and it will blow your business off its course and all of a sudden you'll go from feeling like you're on the top of the world driving all this cash flow driving all this revenue to being like holy we're negative and we're paper thin and i don't know what to do and you
(06:18) feel like you have to keep selling just to pay payroll but there's basically no margin left and then you basically have created a massive non-profit that you're liable for right and if i'm talking to somebody you know who you are you're listening and you know exactly what i'm talking about right now all right and you and this is the eventuality that happens unless you stop and you fix this which makes it feel like you're doing something out of sequence but you're actually doing it the right way to do which is why you have to go slow to go
(06:39) fast sometimes okay so onwards what we have to look at is how can we improve the customer experience right the customer experience how can we create a customer success team or director who can start tracking things like time to value like how quickly can someone you know achieve this value what are nps scores what are our customer health scores what are the things that are going to drive the one thing that matters most which is referrals because what happens is that most people either have neutral or negative word of mouth
(07:05) all right and so here's a way that you know if you have negative word of mouth negative word of mouth is when your cost of acquisition increases at a faster rate than the cost per impression increases okay so if the cost per impression is up 10 and you're up 40 it means that you have that quadratic that beast that i was showing earlier that does this whatever you have that beast but that invisible hand is now compressing your business people who would otherwise would have purchased see your ads see your marketing and say oh i
(07:29) actually heard something bad about that and then boom they don't buy and not only that the negative ones tell 10 times more people than the positive experience one which is why it's so hard to build a wonderful business because it's so hard to have to be so good that you counteract the 10 times word of mouth that happens with a negative experience i know this is crazy it makes it feel makes business feel hopeless but there is hope because if we do this in the right sequence and we say we're going to pay attention to things that
(07:51) matter most because we're thinking about 10 years not 10 days from now we know that these three things are going to be the inevitable things that eat our business and eat our margins and so we have to combat that by pausing increasing our integrity about the products that we're selling right so that we can drive the thing that will be our our our guard our shield against this it will be the invisible hand fighting the negative invisible hand and increasing it because all of a sudden people heard something and then they see
(08:14) your ad say oh i wouldn't normally have bought it but i did hear something about this and then they purchased and all of a sudden what happens is holder markets become warmer markets as a result of the word of mouth all right and so that is how you can use this thing to give you the positive invisible hand that can combat you now some businesses at scale what they figured out is okay they're not shitty but they're just neutral right and the thing is is that these three eventualities will still happen no matter what and so you need to turn this
(08:36) negative into a positive otherwise at scale the eventuality of this business is it will do tons of revenue and you will reach a point of equilibrium where your costs and your and your cash flow are the same and you have run a massive nonprofit that you are 100 liable for and that is very very very stressful and so the only way to build the enduring brand that can continue to scale is to have this invisible hand in your team on your side which means you might have to slow down for a period to figure out what do clients really want what is the
(09:00) job that they hired our products or services to truly solve and how can we figure out a way to truly surprise and delight them in a way that they did not expect which means we want to increase the discrepancy between expectations and delivery all right we want the liver to be up here and we want expectations to be on here and the problem is that most people who are short-term short-term minded what they do is they say they raise expectations in order to make the short sale but then what happens is they can never live up to that and so we have
(09:24) a negative expectation to delivery gap and then that is what drives the negative word of mouth in the business which eventually dooms them and so the idea is how can we have modest expectations that we can set and then create such an amazing experience decrease the time to value so that people say wow this thing was so much better than i expected you should try this out and the easy way to show this is have you ever had somebody pump up a movie to you and be like hey this you got to see this thing it's so good it's
(09:49) good you're like oh man i can't wait to see this thing and then you're like okay that met expectations even though the movie was amazing movie that met expectations because you had amazingly high expectations on the flip side have you ever had an experience where someone's like oh this is a movie it's terrible blah blah blah you go in with super low expectations and then you're pleasantly surprised right even though the product was the same the expectation dramatically changed our experience of the product service etc
(10:10) right and so when we're dealing with consumer products right we want to set modest expectations and then create room for us to over deliver so that we can get this word of mouth and so what we do is we don't trade the short-term sale at the expense of the long-term brand and the brand in a nutshell does two things a brand is simply what people say about your product behind your back that's what a brand is it's a reputation right and the easiest way to build your reputation is improve the quality of your products is to keep the promises or
(10:35) more than keep the promises that you make that is how you build the brand that will endure and that is the thing that can achieve scale because once you achieve scale you also have the hidden power pricing behind you because once people love your products and services if you do a 10 or 20 bump in price and for those of you who sell mass market b2c products these things if you don't have a change in demand all of a sudden double triple quadruple the profit of your business right and you can only do this and have premium pricing power if
(11:00) you have a brand otherwise you're just media arbitraging and you will eventually run into this these three evils right here check check check these three evils right here that will eventually eat away your margins and destroy your business all right so this is a cautionary tale of what not to do and sometimes you have to go slow to go fast to build the thing that's worth building all right so mother nation i love you guys keep being awesome and i'll see you guys in the next vid bye mozzie nation you guys are the best and

Transcript:
(00:00) i had a business owner reach out yesterday who's doing about 550 000 a month and they were requiring for us to become an acquisition.com portfolio company and the conversation was really interesting and so i thought i would share it with you so we hopped on the call you know within the first minute or two you know after saying hey you know how's it going et cetera um he was like yeah uh you know i had a bunch of clinics and then covet hit we took everything to telehealth and then our profit exploded and it's been
(00:26) awesome and i was like well that's great and he's like so what i'm thinking about doing is um helping starting a new business uh to help physicians uh improve their their medical practices and i was just like huh he was like yeah because you know you did this thing with gym owners and you kind of licensed your model out i kind of want to do the same thing with with with physicians and i sat there and i was like this is going to be a really interesting conversation and so after him going you know giving his reasoning behind this i was like well i
(00:57) have no interest in that business at all um and um i was like let me tell you why i was like first off you want to enter established marketplace that is incredibly saturated um the the value proposition that you have is not based on like a ton of personal experience right you have a handful of examples it's also not that unique there's plenty of other people who do this same thing and so you want to enter a space you've never been in before have a new acquisition system a value proposition that's not defined it's incredibly saturated and there's
(01:26) nothing new and i was like i have no interest in this business and he was like huh and i was like but what i am more interested in is why don't you want to take the thing that's making you 550 000 a month that you grew in two years and just take that to five million a month like why aren't you doing that and so he was like well honestly i kind of got stuck and i didn't know how to how to grow it from from here and so it was it was such a nice point because there was a pause and i could you could almost like hear him saying it
(01:55) to himself and hearing him say it out loud i was like so let me ask you this if we could go from 550 000 a month to you know to tripling your your amount of customers you have and going one and a half million a month i was like would you still be interested in doing this whole medical thing you know this other thing that you were talking about earlier with trying to teach medic physicians and he was like oh no of course not i would just want to do this thing and i was like okay so to be clear let me restate this
(02:19) because you got stuck in this existing business you thought the solution would be i will start another business huh not a good deductive reasoning pattern right and this is and this is obviously a very smart individual right and i say this because all of us right i do this i do this all the time right and this is going to be repeated theme because it needs to be repeated right we need to be reminded more than we need to be taught that is a saying that we have in my world and i will i will pass it on to you guys mosey
(02:47) nation we need to be reminded more than we need to be taught do the boring work repeat successful actions and so if he's gotten to this point or if you've gotten to a point in your business and it has plateaued the question is has it plateaued because this is true like i have the only reason a business should plateau that is reasonable that is not your fault is that you have reached the total addressable market as in you have saturated the total the total market of that thing so for example if you were selling dog food
(03:17) and every dog within this you know maybe you saw a specific type of niche of poodle food right you've gotten you know 70 of poodle owners to buy your food and you can't grow any more beyond that right well that would be reasonable but then you'd obviously just do a different type of dog right you you'd hop verticals right so there's not even a reason but it would be the only potentially rational reason would be that your market has changed so a different example is a friend of mine owned a company that does uh newspaper
(03:46) advertising right so they actually help newspapers translate their advertisements into uh digital products which is pretty cool so they are able to sell like basically a whole new ad product to small businesses um who want to buy ads right which is by the way how newspapers make money he could not grow his business because newspapers have shrunk by 25 year-over-year which is 25 compounding the wrong direction and he's been in that business for like 10 years so now the market size is like literally like five percent of what he used to be
(04:11) 10 years ago and so as a result of that he was growing at an inverse rate to the shrinkage of the industry right and so he got to a point where he couldn't grow any more than just basically servicing the ones that are still alive and then as they fell so did his business right and so that is the only logical reason that a business can't plateau that is not in your control and unless you're selling your newspapers which you're probably not the reason is much simpler which is you just don't know how and i'll tell you a different story that i
(04:39) had and then i'll i'll i'll wrap this up at the end so i was having a different conversation with a woman who was doing i think four million dollars a year and she was selling uh info products that were weight loss like weight loss info products so like programs and ebooks and things like that which is cool right she's a big following all that kind of stuff and we got i went i did a podcast with her and uh after we got off the podcast she was like yeah so these are my plans i'm gonna be doing like an apparel line and
(05:06) a supplement line and uh cream line and or whatever right and i just kind of sat there and i was like well i think that's a terrible idea she was like she just looked at me crosstalk she's like what i was like yeah i think it's a terrible idea and she was like oh and i was like why don't you just take the thing that's making you 4 million and make it make you 10 million dollars when you do that and the and the answer is the same as the first answer i just don't know how and i was like right well why don't we solve that problem
(05:34) and then not create a new business why don't we just put all of our effort in solving that problem and so i'm a big believer and this is the the piece that i want to share with you mostly nation is that i'm a big believer in the theory of constraints which means that a system will grow until it is constrained right it has a constraint and then once you remove the constraint it'll continue to grow right until it reaches another constraint and so most people are always curious or many people ask me hey alex how did you
(05:58) achieve quote so much in quote such little time or at such a young age and i say all that in quotes because so much could be and young age whatever but i'm saying i'm just i'm paraphrasing all right and i think that um one of the things that we have done well is prioritizing what problems to solve and that is understanding the prioritization of problems and realizing that there is really only typically one or two things that are constraining our growth and by definition there'd really only be one thing that's the constraint until we
(06:29) reach another thing that might be beginning to constrain us but isn't the true constraint yet i'll tell you a third story so i had a conversation with a young business owner who was doing about 150 000 a month within you know a little bit of time i was able to see that the issue that he had was that he hadn't scaled a sales team right that was the issues that he couldn't scale sales and we had there was a zillion things that he could do to improve his business he couldn't increase his lifetime gross profit he could change
(06:53) his price his pricing model i think there were some things on his messaging that were off at the end of the day the thing that he hadn't done was that he hadn't scaled a sales team and so we ended up circling back two weeks later and he was like hey you know um i want to know how i can like get the most out of this this phone call with you i was like well have you have you scaled the sales team yet he was like no i was like well then we don't really have anything to talk about because there's nothing else that
(07:16) matters right now besides this and it took like two or three reinforcements of that message until he was like you're really not going to tell anything else i was like no because it doesn't matter it doesn't matter that's not the constraint right now sure you could improve your pricing sure you could do these other things but the thing that is stopping this business from growing is that you do not have a skilled sales team and you don't have that skill so let's phrase the deficiency as a question which is how do i learn how to
(07:43) recruit manage and and and train a sales team and to the first business owner the question that i said who was doing the 550 a month was during the clinics it's like the question is how do i scale acquisition and he had uh he had a product that was um it's not allowed to be marketed on um on on facebook and things like that so he had to do alternative methods and i was like so the question is how do i acquire more customers than i already am from a different channel that i'm allowed to when we phrase the questions like that
(08:11) then they become problems that we can solve right rather than i don't know what to do therefore i will just start another business which so many times is the is the entrepreneurial solution and it's because it feels good and we think that somehow when we start another business it's going to somehow grow but the reality is and this is what i have found over and over again is that the businesses will grow to the level of incompetence of the entrepreneur so if you're a 4 million entrepreneur the next business will be a 4 million business
(08:37) doesn't matter what it is because that is your level that is your skill set right that is those that is that is dictated or predicated by your beliefs your traits and your skills and unless you change one of those things when you start the next business you will be capped at that and the other reality is that how many ceos of publicly traded companies do you know that rc's are two companies ceos not founders elon musk is the only is the only exception but he's the founder he's not the one who's running he's not the
(09:02) operator of those companies all right there's literally only one right and he's also a genius and literally like the smartest human being alive but most of us are not elon musk we're if we're on youtube right now we're probably both not elon musk all right maybe we can agree on that all right and so the point of this is that you can't be ceo of two things it's hard enough to be in one business business alone is hard enough right why make it more difficult and three times as complex by by adding more variables in and so i
(09:30) think what most business owners most entrepreneurs can do right now is simply ask the question and this is usually what i'll start any conversation that i have with an entrepreneur who's reaching out for something right or one of the portfolio company ceos is i'll just ask the question which is whatever the run rate is at the moment let's say it's a million dollars a month i'm like what's stopping us from being at 5 million a month what's stopping us and until we can clearly answer that question there's nothing else we need to do and
(09:56) when we ask better questions we get better answers why am i not growing is different than why am i not doing an extra million dollars a month what is stopping us from doing that and if we can get crystal clear on that then we can find the constraint and then we can remove the constraint because we can put all of our effort towards that singular problem and that in my opinion is how you scale companies quickly is it appears fast from the outside but from the inside it feels manageable and clear because we're all focused on the one
(10:22) problem that we're solving at this moment which might be in the beginning we need to increase our sales team and then once we've increased our sales team we might say hey you know we've increased the sales team but they're not all performing the same level so it's like okay we need to have better onboarding and training for the sales team okay we need to do that okay that's the next problem that we solve we have consistency in this process okay now we're doing that but now we're not getting enough leads okay now we'll put
(10:42) all of our focus here right and so each time there's going to be a constraint and we just have to focus our attention towards the constraint and then in so doing we will de-bottleneck and we will naturally grow to the next level and so that has been one of the more valuable lessons that i've had and i i will tell you that there are a lot of entrepreneurs who are listening to this you right now it might be you so i might be talking to you right now is that you think that you need to start another business or another product line because
(11:08) you're stuck at a current level and somehow think that this new product line or new business is going to solve the problem and it is not so if you like this mother nation my name is alex from rosie i own acquisition.com you can go there for free trainings all free no opt-in required etc hit subscribe if you liked it and i'll see you guys next video bye

How I Put Out So Much Content Despite Being Part-Time - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVY4Zo-hpqU

Transcript:
(00:00) are you struggling to make content that rocks well i did too and i made this crazy video without knocking myself into a tree with this crazy background on how to actually fix this so i was actually asked to speak at a seven figure entrepreneur event it was a paid event and one of the questions that came up uh that i was told the answer that i had was uh impactful for many of them was around the concept of content and if you don't know who i am my name is austria mozilla own acquisition.
(00:26) com it's a portfolio of companies that's about 85 million a year all right so uh this is an excerpt of the video of me answering that question if you're struggling to make content enjoy this what is the best way to create content i know it's not specific enough oh i'm not the best diaper so like i really love what you guys are putting out right now seriously straight fire um both of you guys like kudos um and you know maybe i'm just stuck in kind of like my head but i'm having difficulty like just putting it out there like i know i could talk for
(00:57) hours on any topic fitness business life whatever and i do with my friends consistently all day then i get in front and i'm like what the [ __ ] do i make excuse the language um i'm like what do i make how do i structure this how should i say this and another god ah that's what happens so i've done it and i'm not sure if it's just like i've done it so much now that i i also i'm looking more so on from my end to like work with people who want to perform better who don't just want to lose a little bit away who like really
(01:26) want to be you know legit better version of themselves you know i know that's probably used consistently across the fitness industry but um like that's genuinely what i want to help you with i want them to help like hit that potential because i that's what i like doing for myself um so that's my like question there i guess like i probably struggle more with content creation than alex hasn't in a while now so maybe i could talk about that before because like alex creates better content than me like i think that
(01:52) he's been doing this for like [ __ ] eight years i started like six months ago and every time i'm like dude i look like [ __ ] i feel like [ __ ] this is terrible it's awful you know that's all i say like i'm like look everyone hates me like for sure they're bad but alex says like i observe alex and a lot of times like i'll literally take notes on his videos and deconstruct what he's doing because i think he's really good at it right and i'll watch him while he's creating and i've sat there when he's come up
(02:14) with videos and there's two things that i've identified that helped me a lot which is one alex is really sure about who he's talking to and he knows it every time he's talking okay that's the first thing so then when i'm talking like who am i talking to and a lot of the times the things that probably inspire you prince are like about the clients so like a lot of the times when i just made like a really good piece of content the other day because i got off the phone with a company that we have a and we're invested with and i was
(02:37) like i had this epiphany on the phone with them and i was ranting and i just got and went and made the content and i see alex did it all the time he's like i got it i gotta go make it now and i think it's really hard because like i never believed alex in the beginning or he's like no you just gotta like catch it when you get it you gotta go like make like six videos and i was like dude no i like organize my whole schedule i set time side i need to film now but it's almost like a self-inflicted pressure when you like set that time
(02:59) sometimes and then you just start getting your head you're like i must make five pieces of content right now and i'm not so i must [ __ ] suck right and instead it's just like you're just not in the zone because creativity isn't like constraints so it's like you have to catch like when the creativity's there when you're less constrained and you're more free flowing i think that's when things come most naturally that plus knowing who you're talking to and then the other thing i'll say is um i don't think that you should make
(03:27) content on anything you don't want to make content on which i've heard alex say a million times when because he's i ask him for advice on it a lot right now that's why i feel like i can say this to you because i've been asking alex a lot of questions and he's like dude don't talk about anything you don't want to talk about and sometimes make the content that you want to make even though you don't you're not sure it will hit like there are certain videos that i've made like on how to run a great meeting and my youtube guy is like
(03:50) dude nobody gives a [ __ ] and i was like i don't care i need to make this video like for me i know it's [ __ ] important right and so i think it's allowing yourself to just do whatever the [ __ ] you want kind of makes it better and you hear alex's videos he's like dude i'm not making this for you guys and he's serious he's making it for himself and so i think um you know i i i observe that and i'm like that's how i feel like i mean alex you know i'm just speaking for you but i feel like that's how you've been able to
(04:15) continue to make content as your wife who watches you and sees you do it all the time it's like you do you make a lot for yourself you make a lot for the people that you know who they are and who you're talking to and if you don't feel like making it you don't do it i make videos for really only one of two reasons one is because i want to document a thought process so that means it's for me or it's fresh off of some sort of conversation i had with you know a client employee or one of the you know the business owners that we're invested
(04:40) in and so i'm basically making it for them and i just make it anonymous and usually i'm very passionate about the topic which is why i want to make the video um but i heard this from uh grant uh cardone and uh when we were talking about his content strategy and he said you just gotta make [ __ ] and you have to assume no one will see it like the assumption is zero and then just make all your content from that perspective because the thing is is like you guys have heard me say this but like the work works on you more than you work
(05:09) on it and doing the content is a long play it's a super super long play and unfortunately it takes a long time to be good for two reasons one is that you actually have to be good at doing it which you will get better with repetition and the second is that people don't care about you until you've done something like if i tweeted the same [ __ ] elon musk tweets no one would care but it's elon musk and so he's the richest man in the world and if he just does a poop emoji gets shared you know 500 000 times it's not because the
(05:41) message it's because of the messenger and the messenger is a big part of the message part of the reason that content doesn't hit even if it's really wonderful content is because people are like why should i listen to you and if you don't have a genuine answer for that then they won't have one either my views on content have shifted dramatically over time but i think the reason that the content that i have now hits is because like we've made a lot of [ __ ] money and people are like wow that's impressive when i started i wasn't as
(06:09) big on content because honestly it was like i just don't think anyone was going to give a [ __ ] and they probably weren't and so like i'm just adding those as quick caveats but for you specifically what you don't want to do is start talking like everyone else right don't talk about when they should time their carbs don't talk about how they should be splitting up like no one cares if you're talking to your specific avatar then the types of things that you should be making should be relevant to that specific avatar which oftentimes
(06:38) will be different than what everyone else is talking about and it'll be it'll be unique to you that's kind of my my my big picture stuff on consecration but i put two notes in there which is like do it when it's fresh and do it when you feel emotions those have been like kind of two of my my mainstays for making content i i often feel um the way that what you've talked about is like i haven't done [ __ ] yet like i i like why you're right like so i'm almost in that same point with business and i feel with being online um the difference
(07:09) between being in gym and being online is you know online is the same i think working with online coach is the same thing is like why should i work with you you know what have you done right so that's kind of my next follow-up question it's actually second phase is it cool if i start real quick what is the best way to generate those type of leads when you know you haven't done [ __ ] like i hadn't that you have done [ __ ] well the thing is is okay this is a really i think this is a good caveat for everyone everyone here has done [ __ ] but not
(07:37) everyone here has done [ __ ] that they want to talk about so this is the classic example of the dudes who were talking about how to make passive income online make 10 grand a month and they've never [ __ ] made 10 grand a month and they're talking about how to manipulate the stock market and their stock portfolio is 100 grand like who gives a [ __ ] right like you're not warren buffett right but the thing is is that you are an expert at some things and you should just stick to only talking about that stuff if if the source of your content this is
(08:08) like i'm gonna this is [ __ ] big if the source of your content is other people's content don't make it what makes content interesting is the unique anecdotes that you have experienced and gone through which add value and this is kind of a big issue in general with the like the content creation world is that people are making content because it's easy to make content and because they have an alternative agenda the content that hits is content that is made for its own sake as an as with the intention of adding to the body of knowledge on a
(08:43) specific subject matter and so if you have been working with clients and you're like this is something that's worked really well for the guys that i have i only have seven clients but like this has worked really well i hope it works well for you you say that you have domain expertise in those seven clients and no one can question you there now if you start talking about science and you don't [ __ ] know anything about science but you read it on mica's reteller you read it from dr cashy you're not dr cashy and so of course
(09:12) like it's not going to sound as good from you and if i'm going to try and listen to that i'm listening to dr k and so it's like we have to know what we are experts in like i'm only a little bit talking about investment stuff now but for the vast majority of stuff i talk about i talk about sales i talk about acquisition and it's because we built it for six different companies and we've exited six different companies you know i mean in the last you know 10 years right and different types of companies right software we've exited
(09:36) brick and mortar we've done services like we've done different types of things and so i can speak about that with authority and people know that and i have a story to back that up when you just talk about content no one cares and so tie it to stuff that you actually know and one of my last rules of content is if you don't have anything worth saying don't say it and i know this is probably a little contrary to other people's stuff but i don't really give a [ __ ] like if it's not worth saying don't say it because in
(10:03) my opinion i'd rather have someone not consume [ __ ] from me than consume something and then decide to never listen to me ever again because it's a waste of their time that's mine that's my content drop so that piece that i just said that probably was a piece of content that we probably clipped later [Music] all right that helped very much so thank you guys so much and if you have specific this is a side note for tactics right if you have a spec if you have a handful of specific beliefs that people are trying to
(10:27) overcome rather than necessarily addressing the belief you can make it relevant by saying hey if you're struggling with this my client karen and then all of a sudden you have domain authority because you're now introducing a real story rather than just saying here's how you overcome overeating no i have two clients i won't i'll just use sarah and kate as the names but these are real clients that are on my roster right now and this is the issue they were struggling with this is how we dealt with it and i'm going to say one
(10:51) more piece on this content thing because i think it's it's also like i've learned a lot of things over this is that you don't want to make declarative statements you want to say this is the way it is it's very easy to contradict that instead it's this is my two sense this is how i see the world and what i have experienced i might not know [ __ ] but i'm sharing what has been valuable to me and my clients and when you say it from that perspective one the intention is pure and two no one can [ __ ] with you on
(11:17) that because you're you're not saying this is you're not saying this fact you're saying this is this is how i see it and if things change i'll tell you how i think they've changed that's really dope and it's also super unique because like it's your experience right so it has to be wildly different than everyone else's or at least somewhat yeah step one do stuff and then step two talk about the stuff you did right the problem is that people start talking about stuff they haven't done and then that's where they get in
(11:41) trouble because all they do is they read someone else's article on passive income and then they do a worse deluded version with less authority

*REVEALED* Compensation plans that ACTUALLY WORK... - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AH_R5cZNFFc

Transcript:
(00:00) a good friend of mine in my building had a really really interesting way of managing talent to get and drive higher performance and output this will be a short video um but i wanted to share with you so if you're new to the channel my name is alex from rosie owen acquisition.com we do about 85 million a year um and so the reason i wanted to make this video is because at the end of the day every entrepreneur has the same problem which is they need better people and they need to get more out of the people that they have and a
(00:25) lot of that comes from culture and training but every once in a while you stumble upon a process that has teeth and so i haven't implemented this yet it's not normal for me to make a video about something like this but we will be implementing something like this in our holding company and so i think it's super cool because it is reinforced through multiple different psychological uh levers and it's got really cool stuff to it so let's dive in one of the things that he shared with me that he did is that he has a level of variable compensation
(00:56) that's not new it means that there's some level of performance check marks etc that they have to hit in order to get paid makes sense now the way that most companies do this and i'll tell you that what we've done up to this point for us is that in positions where that are not direct like sales for example it's very easy to have a commission structure etc but for let's say leadership and executive positions uh and so this is important if you're trying to build your you know your solopreneurship into an actual company
(01:21) that has values you need to have people who are all aligned and driving hard like owners towards the same goal and honestly it's much more enjoyable that way and so the way that we have split our things up to this point is that we do something called mbos which is management by objectives which are for the company and then also for the individual so we usually split them 50 50.
(01:39) so let's say we've got a a leader who let's say like a director of marketing it's gonna they're not gonna like get a sale but we know that they're in charge of all of the you know rain making for that particular business line they might get let's say let's just use round numbers let's say they're making their targeted earnings is two hundred thousand dollars we're gonna give them a hundred thousand dollar base and we're gonna give them a hundred thousand dollars of variable compensation right now of that variable compensation that half we split that
(02:03) again in half half of that which would be 25 of their total comp is going to be of whether the company grows overall so if we hit x y and z metrics they'll get you know of growth or new sales or profitability then they're going to get those things right and the other half is going to be on whether they did something personally that they have control over so it might be adding a new uh channel or a new platform or creating some sort of process that we want to automate um or bringing in a new xyz manager right those would be things that
(02:33) they have complete control over that we can checkbox even if the business doesn't do well or it doesn't hit the goals of growth or just you know marginally grows they can still get half of their variable comp so if you've got a hundred grand they got that guaranteed and they've got 50 that as long as they do their all their stuff they've got and then they get to participate in the upside of the business if the business overall grows right and so that is how we've done it up to this point it's worked well right but what he presented
(02:56) was a different way that i really really really liked and a key part of this is that the management by objectives and the things that we set we set for our team okay so they don't have a choice in it they just accept it or you know they might try to negotiate a couple terms but that that's more or less how the compensation structure works right with the way that he sets it up is that every position has a level of variable compensation that level you can determine you know you can say you want it to be 10 or you can be 20 or it could
(03:25) be 50 you know it depends on the role but maybe let's say a frontline customer service role let's say we wanted to make a you know let's say 15 of their compensation variable so if they're targeting let's say 50 000 a year then that would mean 7 500 would be potential to be variable so that would be like whatever 600 bucks a month ish right of their compensation is kind of in the air hung in the balance and so here's the cool thing what he does is that he says this is the variable comp and you get to set the goal every month so it's a 30
(04:01) day rolling goal and every month they get to set the goal of what they're going to do they have to you know show it publicly so you get some social pressure in there right you also get autonomy because they're the ones who are picking it and so here's what's cool if everybody on the team has to say what their personal goal is right and they get to set it and if they hit their personal goal as long as it's aligned with the company goal overall like it's going to contribute to that goal then they can make it right they
(04:28) have to obviously prove that it in some way furthers the overall uh division or department's goal but as long as it's aligned in that the extent to it and the amount that they have to hit has got to be quantifiable right if they set that goal they can set it as bigger as little as they want what happens is that the social pressure of wanting to set good goals automatically self corrects you might think well what if they just say they get you know a half a percent you know improvement or something like that and
(04:55) then they hit it cool but the thing is is that people on the team are going to be like dude come on that's the goal and then all of a sudden they raise it but they raised it no one else and so they have complete autonomy and ownership over that goal now for you as an owner what you can do obviously is let's say that your targeted earnings for the person's 50 000 a year that's fine you just take 15 and make it variable so like they have the potential to earn the whole thing or they have to earn somewhat less like don't worry about the variable
(05:26) the the piece is that we have intermittent reinforcement which is another way of saying variable reward for an employee they have complete autonomy and they have social pressure and they have some level of competition and this is really useful in roles that don't necessarily a directly you know tied to the bottom line like sales does and are more difficult uh to quantify right and so this gives those roles the opportunity to feel like they're contributing to the overall growth of the company and have something in the balance
(05:55) that matters so i wanted to share this with you because i thought it was really really cool we're going to be implementing stuff like this in some of our portfolio companies but i thought it was just incredibly sexy and i didn't want to i didn't want to keep it from you because i think it's really really cool because there's just so much psychology behind doing things this way and it just allows everyone to participate and grow as employees within the company and as a as a tangential tertiary benefit of this your churn will go down because people
(06:30) will feel like they're making progress pretty cool right you know they'll feel like they're making progress and that they are growing and that they are challenging themselves and that at the end of the day is what you want every workplace uh to fulfill for your employees now whether they feel fulfilled you have no control over but if you can create an environment that increases the likelihood that they feel that way given a normal human construct um i think that you're gonna build a better business so lots of love keep
(06:57) being awesome mozy nation love you all and i'll see you guys next video bye

Simple Operational Framework (ALEX HORMOZI) - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JOY6ZzBMb_4

Transcript:
(00:00) i think the easiest way to structure operations is first list out the things the desired outcomes that need to happen i don't get a lot of questions about operations they just become obvious that they are a problem within a lot of the people that uh that we help serve and so it's interesting because now that we work on the allen side with resellers it's very clear who's good at operations and who is not and that is typically based on the size of the business the people who are better at operating are the ones who
(00:27) make more money um and this is kind of one of the the unspoken secrets of the entrepreneurial world especially within the internet space that we live in now it appears to be all about marketing and sales and legion and acquisition and although those are very important things and you have to start there it becomes very clear that typically the entrepreneur has that promotion type of character traits and doesn't dedicate the time to study the operational components of the business which typically are the reasons that
(01:00) someone is or is not successful and so i wanted to give you at least my simple mental framework for how i think about operations in general and scaling operations and so for the vast majority of people listening here um you're probably under eight figures um some are under seven uh but most people are listening this are probably business owners in the multiple uh 100 000 a year to you know several several million a year and so for that so this is who i'm talking to within that context i think the easiest way to structure
(01:35) operations is first list out the things the desired outcomes that need to happen all right um and i think of business very much as a pipeline which is from click to close to resell right and um resell within different businesses can be retaining them so that they pay again uh or could be a variation of ascension but when i say click it means how do i get someone to click and that's just within the internet environment click to opt-in to schedule to show to buy to then ultimately want to buy again and so uh if you have like with our gyms a
(02:09) four-step sales process or three-step sales process that's happening uh there are clear activities that need to happen right and so in the beginning you will have your front-end sales and so you need to list that as one of the activities right because the objective would be to sell them the activity is to take the call next you'd have the nutrition orientation which would be the next time you'd meet with them so then you need to allocate how many of those you're going to need based on your current inflow it's the nice thing is is that there's a
(02:40) ratio of for every 10 customers we need to do four of these two of these two of these in one of these right and so what you can do is once you realize what the outcomes are you can list out all of the activities that are required so for a typical client we might know that it takes about two minutes per client per day and if we know that a coach has three hours uh like we want to say winner kappa coach at 100 then we know that that coach is going to be able to do that within x amount of time right and so then we book
(03:10) that time on that person's day and so what happens is what you should do when you're creating your company is when you're creating each of the roles that are going to support you you need to look at a calendar and look at what the times of day that this person is going to be working and what they're going to be doing with each hour of their day and so you simply take the activities in the allocated time that they need to work and place those on their calendar and that's honestly all there is to it all right so i'm
(03:40) going to give you an example to hopefully flesh this out a little bit but within uh within an online fitness business which many of you guys are operating right now um there's really four if if demand gen is being taken care of right so if legion is being taken care of and lead nurture is being taken care of and i'm saying that because it'll make the example simpler but also because that's what we do in our company for gyms is uh if those two things are taken care of then there's really not a lot that needs to happen right so first
(04:08) you need to have first sales calls right to get new customers talking to prospects then you need an onboarding all right that onboardings will be typically a nutrition orientation and also walking through the app and the tech and the things that need to happen um and and that's it right uh the third thing that will need to occur will be some sort of ascension conversation which is going to sell them into continuity all right so that's number three now every customer is going to have one of these things right and so if
(04:35) you're selling here it is you're selling 10 people a week then you need to if you're going to if you're going to maintain that flow then if you know that your front end sale is 30 minutes your nutrition appointment is 30 minutes and then your ascension is 30 minutes then for every client that you're bringing in you have an hour and a half per week that's going to be allocated right now you can divide that up between different people but the keys to scaling is that eventually it becomes too much for one person to do all of those activities and
(05:01) then you start blocking entire pieces of that type of activity to the next person right and so i'm going to continue with the example after that the only other activity uh that's gonna be there would be uh either recruiting coaches right and obviously the fulfillment and so uh let's say that the average customer is gonna take five minutes today i said two earlier but let's just say it's five minutes today right and if somebody has uh uh whatever it is five minutes is a lot let's say say two for math sake so 200 minutes if you had
(05:33) 100 clients per day is what's going to be allocated so that's what it is three three hours and you know 20 minutes so you look at someone's schedule now that's obviously in a perfect scenario um but i'd look at one of my coaches schedules and say okay we're going to do 90 minutes in the morning and we're going to do 90 minutes in the afternoon and we're gonna block those times out so just like that we had eight hours a day now i have five hours left what else do i want this person to do well i probably want them to take the
(05:59) onboarding uh conversations with uh the new customers who are coming in right this is a coach and i know that if we generate uh 10 new customers a week on average uh then that's going to take five hours per week which means i can block one to two hours a day for that and be totally fine right so i might block now this is where availability becomes interesting because if you just do it at noon every day the new customers might not be able to make that time right and so i might have uh you know slots on monday wednesdays and fridays uh at one
(06:30) time and then tuesdays and thursdays at another time and that way it gives them some different times to select from right but again we have our daily activities now that you know for that coach is going to be the fulfillment that's ongoing we might also have them do the nutrition orientation which would be an hour or two hours per day right so if we have an hour let's say an hour per day so now we've got four of their eight hours that have been taken now we've got four more hours that can be used by this person so now we have options do we want
(07:00) this person to create content do we want this person to do outreach do we want this person to uh gosh i mean whatever i mean do we want to expand this person's capacity right so there's or we would know that this person's currently at 50 utilization now if you flip that and then think well maybe this person can take some of the exit meetings right so this is uh maybe this person can take some of the content now this is strategic questions not operational questions but i'm saying this is how you structure it operationally it's like okay if we're
(07:29) selling 10 people a week then we need to have uh 10 halfway conversations where we're going to send them into continuity and then we'll also maybe have transformation meeting which is the end where we take the pictures and all that kind of stuff so if you know each of those meetings takes another 30 minutes each per customer if we know that we get 10 new customers per week then we know that's going to be another hour so 10 hours per week total so that's another two hours per day assuming that they're working five
(07:54) hours a week and so now we're at six hours per day of work all right now that's if someone's being perfectly efficient i would still expect people to be perfectly efficient because i think you don't you get what you tolerate um and so that would be six hours a day for a coach now at that point this coach is handling uh basically everything post the initial sale right they're managing the ongoing fulfillment they're managing the onboarding activities for these new customers and they're managing the back end meetings with them uh to convert them
(08:24) into continuity right and so all of these things put together uh would create a role within the business and so my my my ask or my recommendation for you is if you haven't done this activity it provides you immense clarity in understanding what are the different activities that need to occur in the business to make more money and then once you have the list of the activities then you know how long each of the activities could take and then the only variable that will dictate um how many of them you have is what your
(08:54) inflow is right and so if you know what your inflow is and you know what your base of customers is and the num and your attrition you can very accurately back into what a an ideal day looks like for each of the roles within your business also the bigger you get the more you will find inefficiencies where you're starting these partial roles they're getting full-time pay for half-time work right and so this allows you to be more efficient because you can say hey i know you're only at 40 utilization why are you telling me that you're too busy
(09:22) right now why are you telling me that i need to hire another coach what else are you doing that is not within these parameters now if someone then says well i'm doing this this and this then it's like oh now either they'll be founded at things like things that are useful and you know value producing or they won't be many times they're not but that's not because the person who's who your employee is doing this out of you know nefarious intentions they're not trying to be malicious they're not trying to hurt your business it's simply because a
(09:47) lot of people just don't even know it's valuable right and so they they're they're trying to work they're trying to provide value but a lot of times they just don't get how like they just a lot of times they jump into the bigger picture or why you're not having someone do something right but if the thing that they're doing is is a core activity like i got to check in on these people i got to add them to this uh it takes this long to get the documents back or you know sometimes we have these past password issues then you
(10:11) can see is this something that we can fix operationally within an additional process or is it something that we can um you know ex either throw out and then get this person to refocus and then increase how much work they're doing by by adding more clients to their roster etc and so um all this to say this is how i've thought about operations is just in terms of activities and units of time and then expected inflow and so based on those three variables of this is how many people are coming in these are the activities that need to
(10:39) happen and this is how long they should take then it allows you to account for all the things that need to happen in the business and will ultimately allow you to have a more efficiently run shop now i guarantee you that because of the headline that i had operations redundant this will be one of the least listened to podcasts out there but it is the reason that the people who make the most money make the most money and i just cannot tell you like the amount of people who have access who have tried to copy our stuff at gym lunch and and and
(11:04) and are 1 10th 120th the size of what we are and uh guys just like it's it's the boring work it's the it's the it's the rolling your sleeves up it's the repetitive work it's the meetings and training your team on improving how good they are doing the things that is ultimately the thing that's going to propel a company and those things are based on culture and tolerance of the leader and so um i just want to leave you with that so if you feel like you're constantly overwhelmed and you don't feel like you have transparency into
(11:32) what your people are doing you're like what are they doing all day this is the activity that you can do that will give you immense clarity and transparency to what their actions are so you can also restructure the business to make the most money and also find inefficiencies or additional tasks that you're not accounting for that they are doing which are either revenue generating or requirements or they're totally worthless activities that they're simply doing because they just don't know any better and so um highly
(11:55) recommend doing it and if you don't know where to start the easiest thing to do is have your employees take a time study all right so a time study is very simple you have an excel sheet you have every 15 minutes of the day and you just have them write down what they did for each of those 15 minutes now they're going to think that's going to take a lot of time you are never more efficient than when you do a time study i probably every time i do one i tell myself i'm going to do it again like forever and then i don't but
(12:19) but you will literally be more efficient in your work than you ever will because you know that you're being held accountable to it all right so um it's like whenever layla and i need to go and take a close look at apartment the first thing we do like these numbers aren't adding up this feels weird this feels heavier this feels light whatever it is we go we ask them to times today for a week and then we look at their activities you can also very quickly see where there's right where people are like ah responding to emails
(12:43) i'm like why do you have three hours of emails is there something i don't know about how long does it take to reply to an email how many emails are you getting every day and so that's how you can start peeling the layers back and seeing if someone's being dishonest which happens right and then they're in it because they want to keep their job and i get that but that being said it's not useful for the business and so um that is how if you want to get a baseline of like okay well now i know what all the activities are you can deem whether
(13:05) they're valuable or not and you can deem uh whether you want them to keep doing it or whether they're expanding their time uh sorry expending their activities to meet the amount of time that they're supposed to be working all right so um that is my my quick uh that's that's kind of my mental framework for how i look at operations and how to uh structure them for different roles within the company is first look at the the outcomes that you want the activities you need to generate uh that that outcome how long those
(13:29) activities take per customer per unit and then you can extrapolate out based on the volume based on the inflow what each role needs to do and then at what points you will have breaking points where somebody will become overwhelmed and you need to create a new role all right so um anyways i hope that was valuable for you hope that made sense otherwise have a happy thursday uh happy corona happy quarantine and i hope you are adapting uh because you have no choice but to do so otherwise all right lots of love catch you guys

What I look for to invest in companies [no bs] - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) my wife and i laila talk to 10 to 20 service information e-learning coaching businesses per week that we're looking to invest in and that's you know after they've gone through uh you know several screening processes and what i wanted to talk about today is what are the ways that we think through in terms of the value of the business and not from a dollar's perspective but like what is the opportunity and i want to give you kind of the three-step checklist that i think through and how you can apply it to your own business and think like how
(00:26) can i take what i'm currently doing and make it more of an opportunity for me and if you don't know who i am my name's alex from rosie on acquisition.com it's a portfolio of businesses it does right now 110 million a year so um i make these videos just because i was once broke and i don't want you to be broke so that is why we do this anyways so let's rock and roll when you've heard people say opportunity or opportunity vehicle you need to get into a better monetization structure there's different ways of kind of saying the same thing
(00:50) which is like how much money can we possibly make that from this core thing and so when i'm thinking through this there are three pieces that i think through at the end of the video i'm gonna kind of walk through kind of the the downstream impacts of these things um and how you can apply them but this is the this is the big picture and you have to make these i i have to make lots of decisions really quickly so i have to use frameworks in order to make those decisions right and make snap judgments on like do i think this is interesting
(01:12) should we pursue this further or do should we just give some advice and you know wish them well and maybe see them in the future if they implement it right there's three things that i that i've kind of boiled down to an opportunity vehicle is this something is this something a business or opportunity that i want to pursue and so for a lot of you guys who are starting out this will be very valuable for you because hopefully you can just set this up right and if you're already in the process of building your business then maybe you
(01:33) can make alterations to the business and incorporate this so there's three things that i'm looking at in terms of like what i think makes something much more interesting number one is the number of potential units sold so a lot of times people talk about tam total adjustable market and i'll talk about why i think that that the longer i do this is somewhat of a misnomer um so i'll talk about that at the end but just how many people could potentially buy this thing right or buy this service or buy this you know whatever this thing is
(01:57) how many people do i think would be a fit um to be purchasers of the thing so that's number one and that's just gonna show me how big how long we can run this game is this indefinite is this like you know i mean like if you're selling weight loss like do i believe that people are going to continue is food going to keep tasting better and are people going to be able to change their genetics in terms of how they how they rely on it no i think those things are things that aren't going to change overall and so those are assumptions
(02:19) that i'm willing to base the fact that there's a lot of people want to buy this thing it's just a simple way of thinking through like what are the assumptions that would continue to make this trip so number one is how many people could potentially buy this service number two is gonna be what is the potential profit i can make from the service all right and that's a function of two things which is what is the value that people are are getting from this outcome and then how much does it cost us to deliver it and so those are two very important
(02:41) components because there's some some elements right that are extremely valuable but also very costly to deliver so that's something that i'd be less interested in it might be very valuable but like there's not a lot of opportunity for profit on the flip side sometimes it's a very very small amount of value but it costs nothing right and the thing is is there the gross profit is actually kind of enticing and depending on what that first one was which is how many people are wanting willing to buy this thing then it's like
(03:02) ah this becomes a little bit more interesting right and so the potential for profit and the gross margin of the of the unit of thing that we are selling becomes more interesting which is why layla and i in general like course e-learning you know guru coaching type businesses to work with because we can transition them from a not valuable model into a much more valuable enterprise model that has something that they could sell in the future if they wanted to the third piece is the competitive uh the supply demand or
(03:25) competitive dynamics of the landscape and so i'll give you a counter example and and a good example so if i wanted to get into wireless cell phones right like or cell phone service well lots of people need it okay that's good because how much does it cost me to add one more uh user to my phone phone network pennies right and what do i charge them hundreds of dollars a month but then the third one is competitive dynamics well i'd have to uh beat out verizon and any tnt and all the other big conglomerations of phone service that
(03:52) exist it'd be very difficult for me to break into that and so that's an example of it checks two of the three boxes but not the third one and so different example of that i'll tell you like a hypothetical crazy good example would be if someone had figured out a way to create hardware that does crypto mining right and let's say that that crypto mining you know could get could make people let's say 50 000 a year all right this is i'm using an extreme example to illustrate the point well if they had figured that out then one just about
(04:19) everybody wants you know passive or close to passive side income so total number of people that we can sell this to a lot amount of of value that someone's getting a lot 50 000 in this case it's actually quantifiable how much does it cost us in this instance we'd have to figure out what the cost of the rig would be but let's say it was you know small let's say it was 500 well then this business becomes incredibly interesting as an opportunity and then the fourth or sorry the third is what are the competitive dynamics
(04:45) well if there's no one else who can offer this then we're we're off to the races right but on top of that how new is the space are there a lot of new people coming into it are there established uh people who are killing it that would try and price us out et cetera and in this space for example everything's brand new and so the competitive dynamics are great and it's massive you know it's very quickly growing and will continue to grow probably for the first table so in this instance it'd be like wow this is a very
(05:07) interesting business that i would want to participate in or learn more about and so if you're thinking through these lenses and i'll talk about the tam thing in a second about why i don't think it's necessarily as good as people used to think in terms of assessing the value of the business i'll talk about that in a second but if you're using these three lenses to think about your own business you can ask yourself okay is there a way that i could make this you know applicable to potentially more people so that i could have a total higher number
(05:31) of units or bigger audience that i could sell to number one number two is is there a way that i can reconfigure this thing so it either makes the the customer a more valuable outcome and or it costs us less to fulfill that outcome right so we increase the gross profit per unit sold is there a way that i can reconfigure what i'm doing right and i'll give you a couple rules rules of thumb here that i like which is if i'm just doing any kind of service business i like to have 80 or higher gross margins all right so what that means is
(06:00) if i'm selling something for a thousand dollars a month it has to cost me less than 200 a month and for those of you who are new to making money people will get their panties in a wad about that but like profit is what drives business all right it's not that all of that gross profit that's before cost of doing business goes to the owner that's just everything that you have to chip down away from so you're starting at 80 and let's say you want to run a business that runs 50 margins well then that means you've got 30 percent there right
(06:26) in that thousand dollar a month example i got 300 bucks a month to cover everything else that i do in the business that covers that covers marketing that covers admin costs it covers payroll that covers that uh that covers you know hr finance all of these other fun legal whatever all the other functions of the business so the thing is 80 is minimum and the thing is especially smaller businesses think for some reason that that that's like charging more is bad right and you got to get out of that because if you want
(06:50) to help more people you need to have gross profit in order to scale if you look at the biggest companies that exist out there they sell something that's very valuable that costs them almost nothing so think about google right they sell ad space it costs some moments nothing besides the actual like their incremental cost of running an ad is is virtually zero right and they charge a king's ransom for it right facebook same thing right they charge for eyeballs that cost that like they've one time cost of building then after that the
(07:13) incremental cost of of showing add some more eyeballs is almost nothing so it's all margin you look at the phone company that i was i was explaining earlier they have their one time cost of building the thing but then the at the additional cost of adding one more user is almost insignificant right but they can still charge a great amount of money for it this is the reason software is something that people find incredibly valuable it costs one time to build it and then after that the each incremental user is
(07:34) almost all profit now the only other type of business that's like this with a close to 100 gross margin is information and education businesses which is why layla and i like these types of businesses because they have they have the same margin as software businesses except you don't have the cost of development the downside is that those types of businesses tend to have higher churn because the increased value or the value declines over time when someone learns a skill from this type of business that being said there
(08:01) are ways of reconfiguring the business to increase the stick of the client with by pulling out the things that are consumable versus not for versus one times consumable um and i'm going into the weeds here but hopefully you'll enjoy it so something that's a one-time consumption would be something where i have now gotten the skill from the thing or i've learned the learn the process and this is especially true with learning or elearning type businesses if someone comes for a skill they learn the skill and then the value of training for
(08:24) the skill decreases because they already have it duh that makes sense but the thing is a lot of times when people are learning something there are other components that surround them that are consumable on an ongoing basis so the information is one time consumable as long as they learn the skill but then there become other things that are consistently consumable so community is consumable as in like i want access to it this month i want access to it next month accountability is consumable i consumed it this month to get to point b
(08:49) but now i want to consume it again to get to point c um an additional piece would be if the the type of skill that you're teaching someone creates new problems which most times if you're good at teaching something all problems create solutions or all solutions create more problems right and so when we solve the the old problems we get new ones and that's why we as business owners should always just see problems as blank checks for us to cash in at our own desire right there are problems everywhere and they just have a dollar amount attached
(09:14) to them and the question is do we want to go and cash that check in and solve that problem right like that's how you can you can perceive problems in the world in terms of opportunity for these types of business which is why we like them is that we can pull these pieces out and then create something that has really high margin and has high ltv and continues to build enterprise value over time by selecting and peeling these pieces apart and so finally i want to talk about why i think tam is not as good of a you know indicator for the
(09:40) potential size of a company well look at some of these original companies so look at facebook when they started out it was like supposed to just be a college you know network thing right it was supposed to be you know facebook i think is what the actual term was way back in the day uh for like a yearbook right and so that's literally what the name of the thing was right and so somebody might look at that initially obviously people could see where it could potentially go but they saw that be like well maybe the
(10:04) the tam the total just market is just college students the reason that i think it's interesting is that businesses and founders expand in vision over time and the the time when when a vision is a visionary or founder has run out of vision or run out of future is the moment that the business dies or they sell it because they just don't know what else to do to grow it right what happens a lot of times is that if we can if we can conti you know continue to increase and eat up the the total adjustable market that we have defined
(10:28) for ourselves and our business a lot of times adjacent you know or adjacent markets or silos all of a sudden become more and more attractive we find out that there's a lot of similarities or that we find out there's another need and then we can branch into yet another silo now if you're like i that's the exact decision i did and i went from a hundred thousand to two hundred thousand a year no that was dumb like that's not that's not the point of this like you could you could just scale one avatar to probably you know 100 million a year
(10:52) before doing that that's not the point the point is that you know on a long enough time horizon businesses also through mergers and acquisition things like that they can buy up other companies that are adjacent close to them et cetera and expand the total market they have which is why i don't necessarily think of it on a long term time horizon but i do think about it on a short-term time horizon so if i'm looking at like the next three to five years then i may be like okay we're not going to change avatars next three to
(11:13) five years but do i think that this thing over the next 20 years could eat up more and more of the pie by expanding who we're potentially serving if the answer is yes then the original tam or the current tam is not necessarily what the future tam is going to be and so that's why i don't see tam as as valuable as i think it it is purported to be if you're new to the channel welcome you hopefully can think through those three different opportunity kind of vehicle frames in terms of like how can i look at my tam in a way that
(11:39) potentially could sell more customers how can i increase the value versus the cost of what it is that i'm delivering and is there a way that i can enter a space that is more unique or newer which i can either do by going into the clearly new spaces or by trying to redefine what i'm doing in a new way right if we can do those things then we increase what i would consider the opportunity size of what we are pursuing and then ultimately make more money all right and so that's what i'm thinking about when i'm looking at these
(12:03) companies that we're you know potentially investing time and money into otherwise hope you have an amazing day and i'll see you guys next vid bye

6 Hacks To Make More Money [Increase LTV] Without More Customers - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q2VUuUGfpNY

Transcript:
(00:00) good morning everyone it is alex from ozzy here from gym launch prestige allen and the many other companies that we have in our portfolio they did 110 million dollars in sales and i am going to tell you how we did that without further ado the purpose of this video is to show you the six ways to increase lifetime value all right and i'm going to show you my favorite one at the end of this that i think is the most powerful of the six all right and so first thing we have to do is define lifetime value all right so there's two
(00:26) ways to grow business from uh from a fundamental standpoint number one is you get more customers number two you make those customers worth more that's it that's it so it would behoove us as business owners who are trying to make more and grow our businesses that we should know all of the different ways to a get more customers and b make them worth more all right now when i say make them worth more lifetime value is a very loosely defined term you can look on the internet there's lots of different definitions for it and what i'm going to
(00:51) do is redefine this as lifetime gross profit all right so lt gp which is what i care about all right because for example if i'm selling a meal for ten dollars and i make uh it cost me nine dollars to deliver the meal i mean i make a dollar so if i sell someone and it cost me five dollars to get somebody to buy a 10 meal is that a good business proposition for me well you're making ten dollars it cost you five you're getting two to one well my cost of delivering it's nine out of the ten dollars which means i spend five
(01:18) dollars to make one dollar of gross profit all right and so that is why it's gp all right that's why i don't like lifetime values in a more it's a very amorphous term and so what we're looking for is how much juice how much gross profit is there over the lifetime of the customer for us all right now that's not net profit net profits after you've paid all of your all the other expenses your rent your payroll all the other things um but this is just the gross margin that comes in if it costs you two dollars to
(01:44) buy a thing and you sell it for six then the gross margin's four now you still got to pay you know your warehouse and whatever other things you have going on now hopefully you understand lifetime gross profit so i can get into the goodies all right so there's six ways to increase ltv the first one is increase the price sounds crazy but believe it or not price in and of itself is something that can actually draw alert to your your products do you think if a chanel purse sold for twenty dollars people would think they're as
(02:13) cool no price in and of itself can create alert around a product it can put you in another category so much so that people say this is so much more expensive there must be something different about this i'm going to look at this more closely right number two is that you can decrease the cost all right so if i can find a cheaper way to do the thing i can invest in technology invest in processes i can invest in outsourcing all these different ways that i can deliver the same thing for less i increase my gross profit so
(02:41) if i had that meal thing that i was talking about earlier and it cost me nine dollars to make the meal but i found this new automated robotic process that allows me to do the meals for two dollars that very much increases the lifetime gross profit of my of my bit of my of my products and my business but i didn't change anything besides decreasing the cost all right uh the next one is to increase purchase frequency all right so what this is is getting people to buy again and again and again if i can get someone
(03:09) to come to my restaurant today and tomorrow and then continue to come forever then that's going to be a much more valuable client right and so that increases if i can get all my clients to come in additional one time right that would increase my lifetime gross profit per customer across my entire business all right so if you're tracking with me number one you can increase the price number two you can decrease how much it costs you to fulfill the thing right number three you can get people to buy more times all
(03:33) right and then four five and six are slightly related but different all right the first is that you can upsell people all right now upsells very important here i'm going to define this for you is selling the same thing but a more valuable version so if you upgrade right from uh from a honda to a lexus then you're getting up sold right important and i think it's important to find these terms because they are different types of sales and if you can be more nuanced in how you think you will think better all right especially
(04:05) when it comes to your business so the next so that's that's buying so i'll give you a a food example so if i go from a you know 20 ounce soda to a 32 on soda that is an upsell it's more of the same it's either better of the same or more of the same but either way it's the same category of stuff um i'm just i'm just buying a bigger better version of it all right the next is a cross sell all right across cell is an adjacent need that i am solving all right so in the burger or sorry in the in the coke example if i sell a burger with the coke
(04:37) then that is a cross cell right so upsell is small coke to big coke or you know uh normal lemonade to to organic whatever lemonade you know espresso sun-kissed lemonade or whatever it is right that's an upsell across that would be uh what do you want with that lemon do you want a sandwich with that lemonade what do you want with that soda you want a burger with that so do you want fries with that soda right that is a cross-sell all right that's a cross-sell so you're selling an additional thing this is usually the next natural need that the
(05:07) person is going to have as a result of their first purchasing decision oftentimes these cross sales are actually where the majority of the profit happens so sometimes there are strategies and businesses that are called loss leaders everyone needs this one thing but the next thing they need is gonna be the thing that has all the margin and if you know your numbers you can build a model around that very successfully all right and then finally this is one that's overlooked is down sells right so a lot of businesses that i'll talk to or consult
(05:33) with um they don't have any down cells and so that means that there's all this traffic that's coming to their site or getting on the sales calls with them but those those people have needs too and it might not fit in your primary uh category this is especially true if you sell a higher a higher level service or a more expensive service a lot of times we're still paying for this traffic right this traffic these eyeballs are still yours and i like to think of this as one person's trash is another person's treasurer there's always a
(06:00) business that can do something with uh some of the kind of the sawdust the excess capacity that we have that exists within our business right and so downsells you can either down sell to someone else's product and get affiliate commissions get referral partner commissions for for for sending business their way or right and i like that a lot because you're you have a nice relationship with another business you think they have a good product they specialize in serving that type of customer um and you both benefit you make money they get free
(06:28) customers everybody wins the customer gets solved right and they're gonna thank you for making the introduction as long as you have good partners which you obviously should the other way to do this is to have lesser um you know lesser lesser cost of fulfillment but it's solving the same need so um i'm trying to think an example of this so yeah if you had like a done-for-you service of some type right um and the person couldn't afford your full suite of services you could downsell a kind of a done with you or do
(06:56) it yourself uh version of that right and so making those products taking the one-time investment of making that product or making that you know done with you version of your of your primary done-for-you service or whatever it is a lot of times can serve as a really good downsell right if someone walks into a facility for personal training and they can't afford personal training obviously there's groups and things like that they could do that would be a natural downside but maybe they want to stay at home you give them an at-home version
(07:21) right so there's all these different ways that you can you can slice and dice this but fundamentally if we have people that were normally not giving us money because they would say no but now we're able to monetize them in some way we have now made more money per customer all right and it's really per per person who walks into our business all right so six ways to increase lifetime value of a customer lifetime gross profit one is you can increase the price and automatically you make more money number two is you're gonna decrease how much it
(07:48) costs you to fulfill the thing that you're promising number three is you can increase purchase frequency or getting the amount of time someone buys from you get them to buy more right over time number four is upselling them that means having structured upsells where they can get buy more of the same stuff or better versions of the same stuff all right cross-sells is selling the next adjacent needs you have to think yourself someone buys my service what's the next thing they're normally going to need i'm going
(08:12) to sell them that too right and it also makes their life easier because they can get all their stuff from one place makes you more money everyone wins and then finally what can i do with the sawdust what are all these people who are coming into my business who can't necessarily afford my main thing and how can i how can i create something still going to solve their need but doesn't cost me that much so i can still make a good a good margin on this stuff or how can i refer the business out to someone else and still get a kickback
(08:35) from it and so those are the six ways to increase lifetime gross profit now i told you the beginning i was going to tell you the thing that i think is the most powerful it's this guy understanding price pricing is one of the most underutilized levers in the entirety of business most people figure out their pricing by looking at the marketplace taking an average saying i guess i'll charge that the secret that they don't know is that everyone else is broke think about it everyone else is broke and especially if you're entering the small business
(09:06) ownership the reason that small businesses are small is because they think like small business owners not big business owners that's why they stay that's why they stay small and so don't model small businesses look at the pricing models of big businesses now strong word of caution here there are market penetration strategies that businesses can do because they have funding and things like that but if you look at mature businesses businesses that have gone through the rapid growth phase and then have sustained look at the pricing model
(09:34) they have because what the model that they had they have already tested and obviously has produced sufficient margins that they are able to continue to grow their company all right and so don't look at the small guys don't look at the person who's out of shape and try and model what they're doing right that's a probably fitness is a horrible example because people have great genetics or bad genetics and anyways but point is don't look for the dentist who had bad teeth right look for somebody who's got nice teeth and i'm sure
(09:58) there's genetics there too these are horrible examples but hopefully you get the point all right is that pricing is the most important lever and i'll give you one quick example on this if something cost me 10 to fulfill right and i charge 20 for it cool i'm making you know 50 gross margin but if i say you know what i'm going to charge 50 for this thing or you know what we'll say 30.
(10:22) so i go from 20 to 30 right i just doubled the lifetime gross profit of my business doubled right there are very few of these other mechanisms that can double or triple or quadruple the lifetime gross profit of your business or per client rather than price right which is also why it's one of the ones that people have the biggest limiting beliefs around and the ones that most people struggle to increase and the good thing is if lots of people struggle to do it it means there's plenty of opportunity for all of us all right so six ways to increase lifetime gross
(10:53) profit there's two ways to grow business one of them gets is getting more customers the other one is increasing how much those customers are worth and here are six strategies that you can think about within your business of how you can apply these things um to your client journey so that you can make those clients worth more without doing any extra work lots of love keep being awesome catch you guys soon bye

$100M CEO: "How to make the HARD decisions that change your life" - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7YMjZgr7sHM

Transcript:
(00:00) in the past nine months I've had to make a number of decisions that had a nine figure ramification on my personal net worth and what I want to walk you through is the actual decision-making framework or process that I use to create those and so if you're new to the channel my name is oosi I own acquisition.
(00:18) comom it's a portfolio of companies that does about $85 million a year all right I make these videos because a lot of people broke and I don't want you to be one of them all right so one of the important I mean the most important things that we have in our lives are our decisions right and one of the things that I live by is that we're one decision away from changing our life forever right you're one decision away from drinking and getting killed in a car car accident you're one decision away from you know cheating on your spouse and destroying your marriage
(00:37) you know you're one one terrible comment away from destroying your child right and you're also one decision away from destroying your business if you so chose so decisions are the Wellspring of life or at least the the the train track uh splits uh of where we're going to end up all right learning to make the decisions is an important concept but believe it or not for this video what I want to focus on is actually the environment under which to make the decision during this process one of the things that was
(01:03) very frustrating for me um and this decision took me about uh 12 months to make and uh I'll make I'll explain what the decision was in in another video in the future but it's safe to say like it was it was a hugely impactful decision in my life financially and otherwise one of the difficulties that I was having is that the information that I had was not changing and yet my decision of which way to go continue to falter all right so I kept ping ponging back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and so so I was like it's not my
(01:32) decision-making process right and the data that I have to make this decision is unchanging and yet at different days I would have different outcomes which to me is Big Red Flag danger Alert in terms of like the the um a leading indicator of a bad decision mind you as a quick caveat to this this is not how you need to make all the decisions in your life I would say that you should find and use this process for the most important decisions you make in your life who are you going to marry where are you going to live what are you going to work on
(02:03) right what are you going like those are the decision you know are we going to make this big strategic change in our business those are big irreversible decisions and that's the key for me is that if a decision is irreversible comma and has Downstream consequences then those are the ones that I take more time to analyze all right now here's the here's the the piece that I was missing in my equation for making these decisions which I want to share with you all right one of the key pieces of how we decide is the brain chemistry that is
(02:34) going on so whether you have lots of dopamine lots of Serotonin that are circling around in your brain will ultimately fact how you make decisions believe it or not we are 100% emotional decision makers the thing is is what we want to do is control the extent to which the emotions control our decisions all right that's the key Point here if you don't acknowledge that emotions weigh into all of your decisions even your quote rational ones you are lost all right what you can do is first identify when you are feeling emotional
(03:01) and a lot of guys feel like this this is like a a foofoo term if you're angry it's emotional if you're insecure that's emotional like there are other emotions beside being a panit if you have emotions it decreases the speed with it you make decisions and mistakes love a rush decision you can say it with me mistakes love a rush decision it's one of the credos that Lea and I live by the environment under which we make this decision is important now we have to acknowledge the biases that we have here is where emotions get even worse you
(03:31) have two biases that you have to fight against one is confirmation bias which is your emotional soup in your brain is going to say this is what I want because this is how I feel safe then your logical brain will search out reasons or data to support that thing right it's like making an argument to yourself the problem is you may change your argument but it's not going to change reality which means that the decision can be good or bad based on the soup that we started as the predisposition towards how we were going to gather data second
(04:01) is conviction bias which is how convicted am I in this thing or this decision the more you believe in it or the more you want the positive outcome to occur the more you will purposefully blind yourself because you want to save your ego and how you feel about yourself because you it makes you feel good to think about this positive outcome but it does not affect the percentage likelihood that it actually occurs in the real world which is why you see other people because you can be rational about others you see other people make
(04:29) these terrible decisions and you think yourself why on God's Earth would they make those decisions when in reality that person is you and it's other people who are looking at you this is how I have learned to help mitigate or decrease the emotional impact or the impact that my emotions have on my decision-making process so that I can at least be as rational as I can possibly be and operate from the stance that will benefit my in the highest degree in the long run so here's what it is number one is that I make sure that I am well
(04:58) rested when I make the decis so if I didn't have like a really good night's sleep like everybody knows like there's like normal sleep there's bad sleep there's like decent sleep but I'm talking like you wake up like a newborn child I recognize those days and I I joke with Lila about it CU I'm like man I slept like a like a cherub last night like if you've got so many big decisions I'm like let's let's make them now cuz I feel completely clear all right so number one very very good sleep number two and this may sound [ __ ] obvious
(05:27) but people don't do this all right number two is to be well fed all right when we are well fed our serotonin levels our dopamine levels Etc all get elevated in our body all right like you feel better after you eat and here's a fun one for you your body interprets stress both physical and emotional the same way it's a cortisol response and so you in a very real way when you eat more are more stress tolerant it's why people do it it's why people stressy because you do cope and make yourself more resilient to stress when you eat more so
(06:02) I'm not saying you do this all the time but if you're going to make a big decision you want to make sure that you are wellfed and well rested all right and what we're doing here is we're trying to decrease the anxieties and the stressors and the noise that normally will confound the decision-making process because they'll start triggering emotions that will then force you to start finding and nitpicking different data points to then make a supposedly rational decision that is wrong and that is there to protect your ego rather than
(06:29) what is going to serve you best in the long run and the third piece of the environment that I try and create is if I can I try and get Space away from the Day to-day activities that I have so be that a vacation or literally just removing yourself from the normal space where you operate and because those spaces have anchors in your mind that you have made decisions in the past you have you have emotional occurrences that have happened in the room or at the desk that you work at and so you have these anchorings that are around you and you
(06:57) want to remove yourself from those things so that you can have as few outside influences on the decision as you possibly can now here's the trick is that once you once you create this environment right you want to make the decision from a place of needing nothing and so the definition of abundance is having everything you need which the cor are or the reverse of that is to need nothing else is to have enough and so when you have enough you will not need this decision to get you anything at all and so the key to make as rational of a
(07:32) decision as you possibly can is to not care about the outcome either way and to realize that you already have everything you need or want and so if you have everything you want and you're well rested and you're well fed and you're surrounded by the people that you love and you realize that things that are important in life all of a sudden it will appro it will help you appropriately weigh the decision that you are trying to make and so I don't know if anyone here who is listening to this has an important decision that they
(07:58) must make but these are are the four steps number one rest number two eat number three separate number four operate from a place of needing nothing and when you have those four frames that are stacked on top of each other they can disinhibit to a great degree the extent to which your emotions will influence your decisions they still will but ideally secondarily so or at a at a lower percentage of influence and so it gives us just enough room to peek our heads get above our emotional cloud and make a decision that's truly rational
(08:35) and when we make more rational decisions we much we live a much easier life all right and I'll say that firsthand a lot of the decisions I made in my past that were based on emotions ended up really biting in the ass especially when I had lots of emotions and I acted really quickly in large ways against irreversible decisions great recipe for terrible life so the opposite of that if we're trying to use Charlie monger's inversion process is how would I make a terrible decision I wouldn't be real rested I'd be hungry uh I would be
(09:03) rushed right I'd be I'd be I'd be anchored around all the things that stress me out and I would make sure that I was operating from place of having to have the thing and so we look at those things and we reverse them all to stack in our favor so that we can have the best possible decision and so mosy Nation I love you all keep being awesome and I'll see you guys in the next video bye

How to CLOSE THE SALE when the prospect says, "I left my wallet at home.." - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ul87yrDKZ78

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video I'm going to walk you through exactly how you can overcome I forgot my wallet at home if you don't know who I am my name is aosi I own acquisition. it's a portfolio of e-learning and coaching businesses that does about $85 million a year and so what I want to talk to you about today is how do you overcome this and you can do this in person or you can do it over the phone and there's a process that we've used and this is just I had to learn this the hard way was figuring out how can I set this up so
(00:23) that I can decrease the likely that someone says they forgot their wallet now not withstanding you probably messed something else up in the sale earlier which would make them say that cuz realistically no one ever leaves their home without something to pay with like think about yourself you've literally never left home without a way to pay for stuff all right so like it's not actually real but it's nice to have stuff in your back pocket to know how to decrease the likely that it comes up and then how to address it if it does okay
(00:45) and so once we've got to the end of the sale and we say like fair enough and they'll say yes and you say cool let me see your ID do you have your ID on you which is the question that I would and I would always do this and like if you're in person or you probably do it on Zoom you just look at them you're like do you have your ID on you and I do this and then they know that they take out their ID right and so what happens is they'll either take out their purse if it's a if it's a lady or it's a guy he'll take out
(01:05) his phone or his wallet wherever he keeps his ID now the next part that's important here is that especially if you're in person but you can also see this on Zoom is that when they're taking it out they usually have their ID next to the things that they do payment with and so once they have given you the ID because it's much easier to ask someone for their ID than it is to ask them for their payment method you then say awesome and so you take you you see it you take a picture of it if it's on Zoom because you need it for your stuff or if
(01:26) you're in person you should take it from them and the reason you do this is because it actually builds trust when you give it back all right because it means that like hey you have nothing to fear here I grabbed it from you and I'm giving it back but it's much easier to grab someone's ID than it is to grab someone's credit card all right so hey do you have your ID on you right they say yes they pull their wallet out you can see the fact that they have cards you say great you take it you write down the stuff you make oh you're from so and
(01:46) so oh that's so cool I know I have a dog in Michigan blah BL whatever right you write it down and then you hold it back and you hold on to it and you look at them and you say let me trade you for the card you want to use okay let me trade you for the card you want to use and so when you say that you're literally staring and ideally if you're in person I would shake the card in the direction of the wallet that's sitting on the table or the phone that they have that has like the slots in it or whatever or their purse whatever it is
(02:10) like you're shaking in the direction so they know that they need that that you're indicating that they need to take out their wallet okay so at this point they'll usually you've already you've already set the scene so that you're not going to have an issue with this now this is the only thing they can possibly say at this point because they've now shown you that they have payment methods in front of them they will then say I don't have the card that I want to use okay and so in this instance there's two things that you can do from this point
(02:33) besides like and depending on the level of Rapport you can back up a second be like hey Sandy listen I don't want to make you feel like you know uncomfortable in any way and this is where you have to ask questions based on some of the information that you've had up to this point it's like what would make this not a fit for you right and sometimes it's like you just you just skip all the and you just ask like hey let's just pivot for a second don't worry about signing up I just want to talk to you like what did you come in
(02:52) here for I want to lose weight okay cool what have you done like you basically have to re- remind them in the sale but if you don't have to do that here's the two ways you can overcome this number one is they'll always have have their phone on them okay now if they don't have their phone on them like every single human being on planet Earth has their phone on them right for everybody who's uh online of course there are countries that don't have phones and that is unfortunate but you're on YouTube and you're watching this so you
(03:11) have a phone okay so you ask them to take their phone out or and and you say cool what bank do you bank with and then they'll say whatever bank they bank with and you're like cool can you pull up your banking app real quick and they'll be like okay cool go to statements as soon as they go to statements you say cool there you go you can click any of the months it doesn't really matter and on the top right you'll see your account number and so right there it's the full account number for their their account and you can write that down in lie of a
(03:34) credit card it's an a transaction if you can't do a transactions you should get that set up with whoever processes your money because it opens up another way for you to make a sale the other alternative is to say hey no worries do you have your Apple wallet set up now I wouldn't do that as my go-to I would do the bank statement in a play first because just about everybody who Banks has their banking app on their phone and a way to pull the statements and see the account number so the likelihood that you do that is virtually 100% And so
(03:59) this works especially well for in-person sales because like they're right there they have their phone you can say pull cool do you have your phone on you they'll say yes obviously you say cool pull your banking app up they pull it up you walk them through statements account numbers in the top right and you write it down if you don't do a go get it set up so that you can do this to overcome these issues right and then option two is you have them pull up Apple wallet and if they don't have apple wallet then you're like oh how about this why don't
(04:21) you put one of the cards you don't want to use down right now cuz I have to do that it's policy right so you put it outside of yourself like hey this is just how we've always done it right and you get them to write down the card that they don't want to use we say no worries what I'll do is I'll delay the payment for for for 24 hours and so that you can go home and just and just swap whatever card you you want to use for it okay so it'll run tomorrow so just make sure that when you get back and I'll shoot you a text what time you going to get
(04:44) home okay cool I'll send an alarm on my phone once you send an alarm on your phone cuz you have your phone out um and I'll call you at that time cool great and then so you can get it and so to walk you through this you write down the info and make a joke about where they're from and you build you reinforce Rapport indicate you shake it back to them and say hey let me let me trade you for the card you want use most times this will like this will handle 80% of the scenarios anyways they'll give you the card if they don't give you the card
(05:06) right cuz they say I don't have the card that I want to use because it's the only thing they can really say in this instance is you say cool pull your banking app up get a if you can't do that you've got Apple wallet which you can see do you use apple wallet if they say no then you go to the final step that you can do which is let me just use one of the other cards you have we delay the date and then I'll text you in a minute or when you get home so that we can swap the cards fair enough right now either way the deal was closed with that
(05:28) credit card and you have the contract file that says that okay so you're fine but it's up to them to swap it out now the key Point here is that you can ask questions like hey um you still want to do this right and they're like yeah of course and you're like okay cool then let's just put this other car in and then when you go home you can solve it out for me all right fair enough easy okay cool now sometimes it's like well I don't have enough money and so then you're like cool what day do you get paid and a lot of times it's like
(05:51) whenever I'd have like Fridays coming up awesome so what today's Wednesday let's put it on Friday and that's when you get paid cool okay great boom and a lot of times you can just close the deal cuz we just have to identify with the issue is and you can usually tell based on the report of the person that sometimes they're hesitant because they actually don't know if they have money or they're hesitant because they don't want to do the program and that's why it's important to ask like hey you sure you still want to do this like I just want
(06:10) you to get what you said you wanted to come in here for they say yeah no no no I want to do it it's like cool then let's just put that car down that gets you in you locked your spot up like you're in the program you're good and then when you get home just swap the cards you want to use right and it's like cool got it that is the four five step process a I walk through to decrease the likely that someone says they left their wallet at home and we can prove that they didn't leave their wallet at home if they say they left the
(06:28) type of payment that they wanted the steps to overcome that so that that doesn't blow up the deal for you all right and I learned this just from doing a zillion sales um in my life and step by step adding these little tweaks that improve the likelihood that I was actually going to close the deal and so my hope is that you can use this immediately and not have to go through all those sales uh to use the stuff in your life all right so keeping awesome lots of love mosy Nation I'll see you guys in the next video bye

The Biggest Mistake Everyone is Making - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLkFOaxIdxM

Transcript:
(00:00) literally everyone listened to this this is the number one mistake that i see entrepreneurs make that i made growing up so please do not do this because it is incredibly painful and it takes so long to get out of so please do not do this so i was talking to entrepreneur and i said you have three businesses and you've got three different product lines in each of those businesses and i'll bet you right now that eighty percent of your revenue comes from just twenty percent of that stuff prettis principle nothing nothing
(00:26) crazy here and he looked at all of his numbers he was like yeah i guess this is really the main thing and i was like why did you do all these other things he said well seemed like a good idea at the time and it just felt like there was just extra money sitting there on the table that we should just grab here's what's crazy the extra money that's sitting there on the table is the money that distracts you from the main game i like to use this principle called the women in the red dress so if you've seen the matrix right which is my
(00:48) favorite movie of all time morpheus is explaining to neo that uh anybody in the matrix could be an agent right so there's a woman in the red dress who walks by and then all of a sudden he turns back around and it's an agent right and i like to use that analogy because the woman in the red dress is the distractions that we use the easy money that's sitting there on the sideline so i had a conversation with an entrepreneur um in the digital marketing space doing about five four five million a year and he said i think i want to do general
(01:16) business coaching because i've got all these people who are asking me for general business coaching and i was like why on earth would you do that he's like well i mean they're just they're asking i'm just turning money down and i was like that's the point that is the point of a strategy a strategy is learning when to say no and so i said hold on for a second before you do this right you have your business right now and because it's hard for you to grow it you're going to choose to distract yourself from something that's going to
(01:41) give you an easy win which gives you that nice dopamine hit literally everyone listen to this this is the number one mistake that i see entrepreneurs make that i made growing up so please do not do this because it is incredibly painful and it takes so long to get out of so please do not do this all right what they do is that the thing they have becomes hard because they reach a limitation either on their beliefs their skills or their character traits and so as a result of that limitation on the ladder that they've built for themselves
(02:08) with beliefs on one side character each other to the other and skills just the middle runs that they have to grab because you have to have all three in order to grab the next wrong right they have those those those aspects and they hit a level and what they do is they see another ladder next to them that has some rungs already built because they have those things and they just jump onto that ladder but then they climb and then they reach another pinnacle that's still not above their first ladders limit right of skills character traits
(02:31) and beliefs and so what happens is they make this jump and so i was going back to this entrepreneur and i was like hey man so could you imagine a world how easy would it be for you if you just eliminated everything in your business and all you do is grow this one thing i said how easy would that be and he was like dude that would be easy as hell it's like you know 80 of my time is dealing with all these other things and the operational drag and complexity around you know these other teams and blah blah blah i was like
(02:57) right so why don't you do that and so when i come into most businesses most of the times i get the entrepreneur to do less i get the business to do fewer things because simple you can write this down write this down simple scales fancy fails you can use that you can take it to the bank uncormozy all right mosey nation that's one of our one of our one of our tenants all right simple scales fancy fails and if you got a fancy business i'll tell you the richest guys in the world have simple ass businesses and they have the character
(03:30) traits to see that woman in the red dress walk by and say not today nancy not today i'm good you're not going to you're not going to seduce me today into into some quick money that's going to take me away from the long term goal that's what strategy is it's learning to say no it's learning to say no because you know that your marriage in the long term is going to get you higher returns than the short term quick fix right and that's a character trait that you have to develop and here's what's crazy the higher up in business you go the higher
(03:58) up that ladder that you climb the sexier the woman in the red dress looks like the sexier the seduction appears the sexier the temptation appears because right now if someone were to come to me and say let's say uh or let's just say that you're making a million dollars a year all right in your business let's say you're netting 250 whatever all right just as a hypothetical example if someone came to you right now and said dude i can help you make an extra thousand dollars a month you'd be like i'm good no thanks right but if someone
(04:26) came to you and said hey man i can help you make an extra fifty thousand dollars a month you might be tempted by that right or maybe an extra an extra hundred thousand you might be tempted by that right but the reality is that it's just a woman in the red dress it's agent smith is hiding pretending to be this this thing that's going to give you the short-term win when in reality all it's going to do is distract you from the long-term success that you're trying to have because if you just match the market and you just
(04:54) do the one thing over and over again if you just repeat successful actions if you have aggressive patients if you do the boring work and you let it compound and you let compounding happen for you and with you instead of against you and you use time as an asset instead of a liability instead of being in a rush all the time you actually use patience as a as a lever on your success use time as an asset that works for you instead of against you and if you if you can do those things you'll be unreasonably successful but
(05:20) it's because you took decisions you made decisions you had character traits that were unreasonable and un uncommon right uncommon success is not because it's complex it's because it's hard and it's hard not because it's complicated it's hard because it's so simple no one does it we let our humanity in our irrationality and our need for immediate short-term wins get in the way of what our long-term strategy is and i'll say this again strategy is knowing what you say no to not what you say yes to if you think about who you serve who your avatar is
(05:50) what you help them do you get a lot more strength in knowing what you don't do you have to turn money down you know much money i turn down every day like i literally get a dm i probably get two dms a day saying hey man um i'll pay you 10 grand for an hour of time i'm just like dude i just don't it's just not i can't like i can't say yes that's just distracting to me to to do what i'm trying to do and the thing is is that that woman in the red dress the higher up you become the more sexy she becomes and one of the biggest i
(06:16) mean the mistakes i've made i made many of these mistakes i think i started my second business too early i started prestige labs or supplement company too early and i think i suffered for that it took i think it basically flatlined our growth for two years because of that and it took me to care to develop all these other character traits that i had to do instead to learn how to actually i went from running one business to running two businesses and i'll just give you this quick tidbit if you're listening to this you might be
(06:37) thinking well alex how do you have these women in the red dress because you now have you know six seven whatever we have a lot in our portfolio now how do you reconcile that well now for me the portfolio is the one thing my portfolio is the one thing and that is the that's kind of the overarching thing for me now is that i did this out of sequence and so don't make please don't make the mistake you can do whatever you want but like for me this is a mistake i made is that if you're running a business and here's how you define running a
(07:07) business if the business does not grow without you spending less than five hours a week on it for six straight months and you never have to jump back in that is when you are you have transitioned from ceo to owner all right and right now fyi if it means if you have if you don't have to do anything you're not part of the fulfillment right but you're still ceo if you're still ceo every business needs a ceo right every business needs somebody who's driving the business if you're just not involved in the quote day-to-day you still 100
(07:38) have a job it's just not time oriented but you still 100 have a job but what you need is to make sure that you get your attention back and the way to get your attention back is to let someone else have the intention of running the business which is making sure that you can then move up and then you can make your net worth your portfolio your assets the one thing right and so anywho all of us have a woman in the red dress right that 5 million entrepreneur all of us have that quick win that we want to have because
(08:04) we have some level of demand that's there but you have to say no at least that's my my two cents that's been my experience you have to say no until you get to the point where even when you start that new thing right starting a new thing you're not starting a new thing you're assembling the team that's going to pursue this opportunity on your behalf think about like to think about the language behind that you're not going to go start another business you're going to go assemble a team that's going to pursue that opportunity because you
(08:30) think it's worth pursuing think about that way right or you acquire a business or a percentage of a business and then you help assist that team grow and pursue that opportunity that is how owners speak versus ceos right that is how you go from self-employed to owner and most of us um especially you know younger entrepreneurs and i'm not saying i say younger not in terms of age i just say in terms of experience they're still self-employed you're ceo but you're still self-employed right and i think that if you can make that and you can
(08:58) swallow your pride about saying like oh i have this business and you just realized that um then you'll you'll you'll be much more successful so let's go back to the very beginning to wrap this puppy up if you have lots of little things in your business and you have one big thing that's really the majority of your your income if you cut out all of these other things and make your business so simple it would be unreasonable or unreasonable for you not to be successful if you do that then you probably will be successful because it would be
(09:23) unreasonable for you not to but the thing is it's hard not because it's complicated but because it forces us to go against our human nature and i think if you can think about things like that like charlie munger and warren buffett like they don't spend that much time working right they spend their time making good decisions which doesn't take that much time it just takes a lot of intelligent or sorry a lot of good discipline and character traits right and so if you look at what they do if i think about that like just because
(09:51) something is simple doesn't mean it's not the right call simple scales fancy fails and i'll leave you with that i can tell you right now we make more money like we make a lot of money right now and we really don't do a ton and it's because i had to change my beliefs about like we we we do these things because we have these interpersonal needs we have these character traits we have these deficiencies that we we choose to fill with our business and our activities because we don't want to be alone with our thoughts but if you can let your
(10:18) business just continue to run and not go in and mess things up because you've gotten to that point you've put you know a ceo in place you will be best served and so anyways stop being so fancy simple scales fancy fails and if you're not at that point then be okay with not being at that point don't be too good to run your own business don't feel like oh i have to do what alex is doing because everything has to be done in sequence until you until you know how to get to owner you shouldn't try and do that yet so you'll be successful
(10:44) so anyways um i hope you enjoyed this uh confront the hard work and the hard work a lot of times is simple work it's simple decisions that we have to make don't take the quick wins think long aggressive patience macro perspective and i think that i think that will all ultimately be the better for it at least these journals these little vlogs are for me to to write down the principles that that have made uh given us disproportionate returns and i hope to share them with you mozi nation keeping awesome catch you next video bye

How I'm building a BILLION DOLLAR empire working 2-3 days per week.. - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) this video is for all my friends who are doing you know one million three million five million dollars a year and who come to me and are always like man i want a challenge this is so boring i want to do something new and exciting and so let me tell you a story um about my neighbor and so my neighbor had a trash business all right trash collection business about as boring as it gets and he sold his business a few years back for a lot of money i'll just put it that way and i was walking one day and uh he was like watering his lawn and
(00:29) i was like hey man um you know what's going on and uh he said i just got out of my non-compete and i was like oh that's awesome so you know what are you planning on doing he's like well i plan on doing the exact same thing again and i was like wait what what do you mean he was like well i plan on starting another trash business and selling it right back to the guys who bought my last one and i was like what and like he could tell that i was kind of like confused by this and he was like he's like why would i learn something
(00:54) new he's like i already know everything about the trash business he's like i'll just do it again it just really hit me because i was like so many entrepreneurs myself included right and i made this mistake so many times earlier on in my career we desire novelty we desire challenges we want growth right but the thing is is that we think growth means new when i think that a lot of times we could redefine growth as meaning we develop the character traits to be able to persist and continue to do the same things over and over again you
(01:21) don't see these real estate moguls for example being like man i've built you know 20 million dollars in real estate i kind of just need a challenge i'm going to start i'm going to start a restaurant right they don't do that i mean think about how stupid that would sound to you you're like dude you're so good at real estate just keep doing real estate right but i see this especially in the marketing community more than anything is this this need for constant change and and and growth and challenge right but i think you need to redefine the
(01:47) challenges this is becoming hard for you because you're getting bored so the challenge is learning to a be comfortable with boredom or b not need it because the business doesn't exist to satisfy our internal deficiencies right that's usually when most of us build it we're insecure we need connection we need we want status right these are all the things that we build our business to solve but our business doesn't actually need to solve any of those things it just needs to provide value to the customer and then we try and extrapolate or
(02:15) project our own needs onto the business and in so doing break our businesses and make the wrong decision and so let me tell you a different story so i've had one two three different guys tell me uh in the in the internet marketing space who i say one's doing 15 to 20 million another is doing about 10 million now there's doing about 10 million a year probably in the neighborhood of like three-ish million in profit per year around there three to five and so each of them on their own reached out to me and said hey man i think i'm gonna start um
(02:45) a software company because i'm uh i'm not i'm not challenged enough doing this anymore right and um i thought about that and i just thought how kind of hilarious it was it's like i've risen to the top of my game i'm bored doing what i'm doing and so i'm going to stop doing this and then i'm going to enter a new arena where everyone else has been doing that for 10 years and there are other kingpins in that arena and i'm gonna try and relearn everything from ground zero uh and then try and beat them now here's what's interesting
(03:10) right here's what's crazy if you were to let's say make a hundred thousand dollars a year in your business and you decide that you're going to be a true entrepreneur and it means you're never going to quit and it means that you're going to continue to do business for you know 40 years or whatever right if you were to gain at the same pace as the marketplace which by the way when you're smaller is really easy right it's 10 a year if you were to grow by 10 a year by the end of the 40 years you would have a gazillion dollars right
(03:35) but most people are always trying to beat the market when in reality if you just matched the market you would become extraordinarily crazy wealthy at the end of this game but because we are so frenetic and we have these insecurities that we project on our business and then force our business to solve our own personal issues we end up breaking the thing that is actually working just fine because we have these interpersonal needs that we're trying to satisfy and i this was very hard for me to learn i'm saying this because for me this was a
(04:02) mistake that i made over and over again probably for the first four years of business for me i tried to make my business solve my personal problems when it really just needed to solve my clients problems and i needed to do with my own personal stuff right one of the things that i wanted to give you was the ways that i create uh challenges for myself within the business without destroying the business all right so let me give you two different things that have been complete lifesavers for me so i have desires for innovation i have
(04:28) desires for new things right and so where to channel that is not to create new businesses where to channel that is to create new front ends or new backends so meaning like how can i change the hooks how can i change the creative how can i change the ad ideas the marketing the front ends that bring people in because the more variety i have there the more different types of avatars i'm willing to attract and ultimately grow the business so you can use that entrepreneurial add but use it in a way that's going to serve you right and
(04:56) serve the business without rather than breaking the business right whereas if you start creating more businesses to satisfy your add then what ends up happening is well you know you have lots of businesses and you don't have any money that's the first thing the second thing that i do um that i'll walk you through is understanding constraints all right one of the the lessons that i've learned over the last 12 months is multiple metrics for success and so i'll dive more into that in another video but basically for a very long time in my
(05:21) life the only metric for success that i had was how much profit and how much increase in net worth i had at the end of the year that was it's all i cared about and i think that as we've gotten to the point where like an increase in net worth the marginal utility of more money meaning like the amount of extra good that i can purchase or that more money can purchase me is very very little right there's nothing that an extra 10 million dollars or an extra 50 million dollars is going to purchase me that the first you know 50 doesn't
(05:44) buy me right there's nothing right that i can there's nothing that i can't already get right and so when you think about things like that right what it forces you to do is create different ways to win right because it's a game right if you're entrepreneurial then you should especially if you become more successful you'll see it as a game right and so you have this game that we're playing and we have these metrics for success that originally are just increasing net worth right but then you could say can i increase my
(06:09) net worth and have a good marriage can i increase my net worth and and be in shape right and so one of the constraints that i'd like to offer you as a challenge to give to yourself so that you don't get bored in the business that you have is a constraint around time right and so that was one of the things that i did over the last 12 months was like okay i want to build something that does a billion dollars a year in revenue which is the goal for the portfolio and transparently we're not there you know we're at about 85 million
(06:36) dollars a year across our portfolio we're still a little short um but it's a good thing to focus on now the thing is is that i don't want to make and the way that i have to make that is i can't i'm not gonna outwork to get to a billion right you have to make good decisions and you have to let compounding work in your favor right because if we have the 85 million and we go grow by 10 a year in you know 20 years we'll probably be there right and so well let's see a doubling would happen every seven years so 21 years
(07:05) would be double double double so that would be two four eight so eight times 85 no we'd still be so we need another doubling so we'd have to like 28 years from now we could be it if we just grow at the market rate which is pretty encouraging i think because i think we can beat the market right but anyways the point is adding constraints makes the goals far more interesting because i think the first level of achieving any goal is learning how to sacrifice everything to achieve the goal which i think candidly i don't know many people who
(07:32) are super successful who haven't done that you have to be able to put everything you have on the altar of success and sacrifice it for what you want some people may not like that idea and that's fine i don't i just don't know people who are ultra successful who have done that and the reason they are willing to sacrifice everything is because the deficiency they have in their soul is so great that the pain they're suffering from is like for not having the thing is so great that they'll put everything else on the altar for their success and i
(07:53) know that i did that firsthand and so i remember even when i when i was growing growing into this entrepreneurial role that i didn't tell myself um i'm gonna outwork everyone because i didn't even think that was realistic i said i will out sacrifice everyone so when my competitors are going out to dinner when my competitors are hanging out with their kids or my competitors or hanging out with their wives or being good husbands i was like i will get ahead that was what i told myself and it worked but at a certain point and this
(08:15) is why multiple metrics of success are important the new goals that i'm setting have constraints on them because anyone can just sacrifice everything to get what they want but the question is can i build a billion dollar a year revenue portfolio working two or three days a week right and can i do that also while being in competitive shape physically right and working out one to two hours a day because i like it can i do all of those things and so this is kind of the new levels of challenge i'm doing rather than trying to
(08:44) break what i have and going doing 10 other new things it's like can i add constraints to the existing game to make the game more fun for me without breaking the machine because ultimately like the machine doesn't serve to it doesn't exist to serve me uh it exists to serve the customer and uh making sure that i don't conflate those two things has been a very valuable lesson in the very beginning for me i'll tell you the story when i when i started uh the first time where i really saw success was when i learned how to
(09:09) sacrifice i was saying sacrifice earlier so i'll tell you how i actually learned how to do this so when i was in college um i ended up pledging a fraternity and it was a very hard pledging process hard being like time consuming right and i think we had to basically every hour of the day minus three hours and minus class time so we had three hours of study hall and we had uh whatever our class time was all the rest of the time we had during the day we had to be at the house and doing chores and stuff and so that was pretty miserable and
(09:34) that wasn't like you know a ton of fun um but what ended up happening was i ended up getting really good grades that semester um in college and uh it was because they forced me to do three hours a day every single day of homework and if you do three hours a day of work every day and that's what i realized in college um there's the days that you don't have work to do if you still work three hours you get ahead on future work and so i realized that for only three hours a day if i just did that i would i think that that semester i got like a
(10:01) 383 or something like that what i did after i finished pledging was i realized that all these extra hours of the day were mine and so what i did was i was like well if i can just study all the rest of the hours then i should do really really well and that ended up being a really good methodology was i just sacrificed all of my day um so i basically went to the gym went to the library um and went to class and that was it and i i that was it i never worked past 9 p.
(10:24) m and i went out almost the nights of the week but by always doing it that way and not wasting my time i ended up doing really well and it was the first time i ever learned how to sacrifice everything which was everything else i just didn't do anything besides work work out and go to class like that was it throw on day and so when i started applying that same kind of concept to business it was actually fairly easy for me because i was so used to sacrificing everything i just switched over what i was sacrificing for and i think that you have to learn how to
(10:50) sacrifice first in order to learn how not to sacrifice later right because a lot of people were like why would i achieve the success you have or whatever but i don't want to sacrifice x y and z i just i think you can say that i just don't know anyone who's done it um it's kind of like saying i want to get over the the hole that money has on my life except i haven't made any money i think you have to achieve something before you can give it up right i mean buddha who who gave up his his worldly riches like he talks you
(11:17) know he he walked the middle path because he had been extremely wealthy in a prince and then given it all up and lived as a poor person and then walked the middle path and so i think that in order for us to walk the middle path in life we have to have achieved the thing in order we have to achieve mastery over the thing before we can truly master it and mean and give it away right and that's how we can eliminate the desire for the thing because we truly know what it's like to have it right and then that means we can truly
(11:40) know why we don't need it and so i think that's um i know it didn't mean to get 100 business philosopher on you um but uh but that's that's kind of where i think this goes full circle so um big picture here multiple metrics of success don't change your business just to challenge yourself find new ways to either create front ends or new product lines or things like that within your business that can satisfy your add and if neither of those things are what you want to do then just use constraints to create challenges in your own business that
(12:10) improve your life in other ways right and uh you can uh always go back to my neighbor uh the guy who sold his business for trash uh his trash business uh for a lot of money and uh and just said he's like why would i learn another business when i'm already really good at this one he's like i'd have to learn everything from ground one he's like that just sounds hard and stupid and i couldn't really argue with the wisdom of that advice because he doesn't use his business to satisfy his interpersonal desires he used his
(12:35) business to create wealth which was the whole point so anyways i hope you found value in this video um click subscribe if you did more videos like this uh to help you make more money uh mozi nation keep being awesome and i'll catch you guys on flip side bye

Transcript:
(00:00) this video is for all my friends who are doing you know one million three million five million dollars a year and who come to me and are always like man i want a challenge this is so boring i want to do something new and exciting and so let me tell you a story um about my neighbor and so my neighbor had a trash business all right trash collection business about as boring as it gets and he sold his business a few years back for a lot of money i'll just put it that way and i was walking one day and uh he was like watering his lawn and
(00:29) i was like hey man um you know what's going on and uh he said i just got out of my non-compete and i was like oh that's awesome so you know what are you planning on doing he's like well i plan on doing the exact same thing again and i was like wait what what do you mean he was like well i plan on starting another trash business and selling it right back to the guys who bought my last one and i was like what and like he could tell that i was kind of like confused by this and he was like he's like why would i learn something
(00:54) new he's like i already know everything about the trash business he's like i'll just do it again it just really hit me because i was like so many entrepreneurs myself included right and i made this mistake so many times earlier on in my career we desire novelty we desire challenges we want growth right but the thing is is that we think growth means new when i think that a lot of times we could redefine growth as meaning we develop the character traits to be able to persist and continue to do the same things over and over again you
(01:21) don't see these real estate moguls for example being like man i've built you know 20 million dollars in real estate i kind of just need a challenge i'm going to start i'm going to start a restaurant right they don't do that i mean think about how stupid that would sound to you you're like dude you're so good at real estate just keep doing real estate right but i see this especially in the marketing community more than anything is this this need for constant change and and and growth and challenge right but i think you need to redefine the
(01:47) challenges this is becoming hard for you because you're getting bored so the challenge is learning to a be comfortable with boredom or b not need it because the business doesn't exist to satisfy our internal deficiencies right that's usually when most of us build it we're insecure we need connection we need we want status right these are all the things that we build our business to solve but our business doesn't actually need to solve any of those things it just needs to provide value to the customer and then we try and extrapolate or
(02:15) project our own needs onto the business and in so doing break our businesses and make the wrong decision and so let me tell you a different story so i've had one two three different guys tell me uh in the in the internet marketing space who i say one's doing 15 to 20 million another is doing about 10 million now there's doing about 10 million a year probably in the neighborhood of like three-ish million in profit per year around there three to five and so each of them on their own reached out to me and said hey man i think i'm gonna start um
(02:45) a software company because i'm uh i'm not i'm not challenged enough doing this anymore right and um i thought about that and i just thought how kind of hilarious it was it's like i've risen to the top of my game i'm bored doing what i'm doing and so i'm going to stop doing this and then i'm going to enter a new arena where everyone else has been doing that for 10 years and there are other kingpins in that arena and i'm gonna try and relearn everything from ground zero uh and then try and beat them now here's what's interesting
(03:10) right here's what's crazy if you were to let's say make a hundred thousand dollars a year in your business and you decide that you're going to be a true entrepreneur and it means you're never going to quit and it means that you're going to continue to do business for you know 40 years or whatever right if you were to gain at the same pace as the marketplace which by the way when you're smaller is really easy right it's 10 a year if you were to grow by 10 a year by the end of the 40 years you would have a gazillion dollars right
(03:35) but most people are always trying to beat the market when in reality if you just matched the market you would become extraordinarily crazy wealthy at the end of this game but because we are so frenetic and we have these insecurities that we project on our business and then force our business to solve our own personal issues we end up breaking the thing that is actually working just fine because we have these interpersonal needs that we're trying to satisfy and i this was very hard for me to learn i'm saying this because for me this was a
(04:02) mistake that i made over and over again probably for the first four years of business for me i tried to make my business solve my personal problems when it really just needed to solve my clients problems and i needed to do with my own personal stuff right one of the things that i wanted to give you was the ways that i create uh challenges for myself within the business without destroying the business all right so let me give you two different things that have been complete lifesavers for me so i have desires for innovation i have
(04:28) desires for new things right and so where to channel that is not to create new businesses where to channel that is to create new front ends or new backends so meaning like how can i change the hooks how can i change the creative how can i change the ad ideas the marketing the front ends that bring people in because the more variety i have there the more different types of avatars i'm willing to attract and ultimately grow the business so you can use that entrepreneurial add but use it in a way that's going to serve you right and
(04:56) serve the business without rather than breaking the business right whereas if you start creating more businesses to satisfy your add then what ends up happening is well you know you have lots of businesses and you don't have any money that's the first thing the second thing that i do um that i'll walk you through is understanding constraints all right one of the the lessons that i've learned over the last 12 months is multiple metrics for success and so i'll dive more into that in another video but basically for a very long time in my
(05:21) life the only metric for success that i had was how much profit and how much increase in net worth i had at the end of the year that was it's all i cared about and i think that as we've gotten to the point where like an increase in net worth the marginal utility of more money meaning like the amount of extra good that i can purchase or that more money can purchase me is very very little right there's nothing that an extra 10 million dollars or an extra 50 million dollars is going to purchase me that the first you know 50 doesn't
(05:44) buy me right there's nothing right that i can there's nothing that i can't already get right and so when you think about things like that right what it forces you to do is create different ways to win right because it's a game right if you're entrepreneurial then you should especially if you become more successful you'll see it as a game right and so you have this game that we're playing and we have these metrics for success that originally are just increasing net worth right but then you could say can i increase my
(06:09) net worth and have a good marriage can i increase my net worth and and be in shape right and so one of the constraints that i'd like to offer you as a challenge to give to yourself so that you don't get bored in the business that you have is a constraint around time right and so that was one of the things that i did over the last 12 months was like okay i want to build something that does a billion dollars a year in revenue which is the goal for the portfolio and transparently we're not there you know we're at about 85 million
(06:36) dollars a year across our portfolio we're still a little short um but it's a good thing to focus on now the thing is is that i don't want to make and the way that i have to make that is i can't i'm not gonna outwork to get to a billion right you have to make good decisions and you have to let compounding work in your favor right because if we have the 85 million and we go grow by 10 a year in you know 20 years we'll probably be there right and so well let's see a doubling would happen every seven years so 21 years
(07:05) would be double double double so that would be two four eight so eight times 85 no we'd still be so we need another doubling so we'd have to like 28 years from now we could be it if we just grow at the market rate which is pretty encouraging i think because i think we can beat the market right but anyways the point is adding constraints makes the goals far more interesting because i think the first level of achieving any goal is learning how to sacrifice everything to achieve the goal which i think candidly i don't know many people who
(07:32) are super successful who haven't done that you have to be able to put everything you have on the altar of success and sacrifice it for what you want some people may not like that idea and that's fine i don't i just don't know people who are ultra successful who have done that and the reason they are willing to sacrifice everything is because the deficiency they have in their soul is so great that the pain they're suffering from is like for not having the thing is so great that they'll put everything else on the altar for their success and i
(07:53) know that i did that firsthand and so i remember even when i when i was growing growing into this entrepreneurial role that i didn't tell myself um i'm gonna outwork everyone because i didn't even think that was realistic i said i will out sacrifice everyone so when my competitors are going out to dinner when my competitors are hanging out with their kids or my competitors or hanging out with their wives or being good husbands i was like i will get ahead that was what i told myself and it worked but at a certain point and this
(08:15) is why multiple metrics of success are important the new goals that i'm setting have constraints on them because anyone can just sacrifice everything to get what they want but the question is can i build a billion dollar a year revenue portfolio working two or three days a week right and can i do that also while being in competitive shape physically right and working out one to two hours a day because i like it can i do all of those things and so this is kind of the new levels of challenge i'm doing rather than trying to
(08:44) break what i have and going doing 10 other new things it's like can i add constraints to the existing game to make the game more fun for me without breaking the machine because ultimately like the machine doesn't serve to it doesn't exist to serve me uh it exists to serve the customer and uh making sure that i don't conflate those two things has been a very valuable lesson in the very beginning for me i'll tell you the story when i when i started uh the first time where i really saw success was when i learned how to

This first hire nearly bankrupt me...but was worth it.. - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aOUK4DG0-kM

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video i'm going to tell you who to hire first when you are scaling your business number one question i get all the time is when should i hire who do i hire at what point do i know it's right and the first secret to this is that you're never going to know by the way my name is alex ramozzi on acquisition.
(00:16) com we're going to portfolio companies of 85 million a year so let's rock and roll so one of the biggest issues is when you're starting as a business owner is that you don't know what the hell you're doing right and that's okay but what i want to introduce you is a simple concept that i use when thinking through this as a simple tool that you can use when you think about your stack of time all right so let's say that this is all of the time that you have in your day let's say you spend a certain amount of time doing uh you know admin work
(00:45) and then you do some sales and you do some marketing and you do some uh you know let's say billing and then you do some uh you know customer facing stuff the way that you determine which of these things you hire next is you look at two factors number one is what is the greatest percentage of your time like where is the greatest percentage of your time that you are spending number two is what is the cost that's the lowest cost activity that is the highest percentage of time and so what you want to look at here is a
(01:19) scribe of value to each of these types of things now you can look at market value or what i prefer to do is which of these things is making me the most money all right so right now there will probably be activities in your business that make you money but they don't make you as much money as let's say sales does and so we're not going to outsource something that's crucial to the business at this early stage when we have something let's say admin and billing that we can outsource earlier on that have a lower likelihood of impacting
(01:47) your business in a negative way all right so we're really trying to play defense here when we're looking at how we're going to hire and the objective and this is the main thing here because understanding what problem we are solving is one of the most important aspects of entrepreneurship is picking the problem that we're truly solving most people start solving problems that don't even exist we're solving problems that not aren't even problems in their business they're not even constraints that exist and so the objective of the
(02:10) hire should be to give you time it should be to give you time back and so the idea is how can i get the most time back for the least amount of money and that's consistently the process that you'll continue to do in your entrepreneurial journey is how do i get more time back over and over and over again and independent what everyone says the process of entrepreneurship is just buying back time and increasing your level of skill so that you can do higher and higher revenue activities to the point where the only thing and i'll
(02:40) tell you where the final place that you'll have is that you'll just be making decisions right this is the highest level and then beyond that it's having a vision that everyone is aligned with that they're making their decisions through you provide the lens through which people underneath of you make decisions in alignment so that they can move the entire organization forward on your behalf now when you're starting out most times most times what you will need to end up doing your first one of your first few hires will be one of these two things
(03:14) a it will be some sort of administrative help or some sort of first follower who will help you who believes in you believes in your vision and like this is why spouses a lot of times end up being that first hire right that girlfriend or whatever who ends up believing in you and you know quitting their job so that they can you know support you and you guys go do this thing together right and that's because they're going to be they're going to be more invested you get way more work out of that person than you would out of a normal employee
(03:40) but you can also find those types of people and that is very common as the first type of hire is kind of a a jack of all trades admin help person all right the other type of hire that i see so usually one of these two is the first hire is somebody who can assist with the fulfillment so if you have productized your service which is going to be one of the first things you need to do is figure out how you can rep reliably replicate the same outcome among customers which is why it's important to narrow down the type of customer you're
(04:10) servicing and the type of outcome you're delivering so that you can make it easier for someone else to accomplish the same thing as you so that you can focus on running the business and not actually doing the thing you are selling it is productizing the service and so that means that in the beginning you'll need to always work overtime because you're basically working one and a half or double so you're working on doing the business things while also building the infrastructure foundation so that other people can work within this model most
(04:36) people who are starting out i'll write this down for you so that you can have a visual for it number one is usually either an admin slash helper for you or company somebody to help with customer fulfillment those are typically one of the first two hires you will have and this is obviously with a broad generalization based on a founder-owned bootstrap business that doesn't have funding which 99 of businesses fall in that category all right now if you're a three-founder you know vc-backed startup then obviously you might have different
(05:06) hiring schema right off the bat but if you're starting this from your from ground zero and this is you and you are hustling these are usually going to be the first two uh highers you have because these are usually the things that take you the most amount of time that provide the least amount of value all right so that you continue to work your way up this uh this this this value ladder which i can probably do at another time as you go up this this ladder they should be the things that take you uh that bring the most amount
(05:33) of money and the least amount of time so this is a little time hourglass which i failed miserably at but the most amount of money least amount of time that is what you are you're spending your time doing and you outsource these things in this order and that is the thought process that i use when i'm trying to figure out what things and what people i need to hire next which is what's taking me the most amount of time that i can buy from the marketplace the least amount of money emozy nation make these videos a lot of
(06:02) people broke and i would should be one of them i want you to scale the crap out of your business and i'd love to know that this video helped you so anyways lots of love keep being awesome i'll see you guys in the next vid bye

My 4-Part Invesing Model (with real example) - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BnvkMpUu-7c

Transcript:
(00:00) one of the deals i did 60 days ago pays me a hundred thousand dollars a month in passive income just by being the bank and so what i will show you in this video is how i find these deals how i structure these deals and uh one thing to make sure that you don't do because actually one of the ceos of the companies in our portfolio actually reach out to me because he got an email from his wealth advisor i'm gonna use quotes here because it was almost borderline unethical what the deal looked like but i want to walk you through it
(00:25) because it looks okay but as you as i show you the framework that i use which has four four lenses that i look at investments through you'll see more and more why it wasn't good and then at the end i'll show you what what was good and the deal that actually made this happen all right so the deal that his advisor sent him was hey we've got a business that wants 450 000 right 450k to invest in their startup okay so we're sending this money to a startup just in case you're curious it's a little bit risky all right but we'll get
(00:57) into that in a second so 450 000 to a startup and he said they're willing to pay you 10 per year and they're going to pay this at the end of 12 months all right which means at the end of 12 months he's going to get 450 000 plus 45k all right that is what the uh return is going to be all right and so they were like hey can you break this down they're like it doesn't sound like a good deal but we kind of want you to walk us through it all right and so here's how you should think about these investments all right number one is yield
(01:36) all right which is how much money cash flow is coming to me every single month all right that is one way that you look at the investment the next way is capital preservation which is how likely am i am i going to be preserving my capital that my money is going to come back to me all right all of these are on a scale so it's not like a yes no it's more like to what extent right the next one is tax advantage all right so if i if i do this investment is this going to cost me a lot tax wise right something that's treated as
(02:06) capital gains versus something that's income is going to have a better tax treatment and then finally you've got equity growth all right so does the thing that i'm buying or putting my money in become more valuable all right so when you're looking at any kind of investment or anywhere to put your money look through this lens of one two three four and think okay to what extent is my capital being preserved to what extent am i getting the yield what are my tax advantages am i growing all right and so i walk them through
(02:31) this exact same process and so let's look at this deal that you got all right so capital preservation box one uh well they're this is going to a startup and they're saying they're not going to pay you anything at all and then at the very end they're going to give you uh 495 000 at the end right 450 plus 45 000.
(02:47) uh how likely do i think that's happening with a startup i would put that as an no probably not likely yield wise i'm going to get 10 okay that's cash flow kind of good but for for a debt deal uh probably not great all right because we're going to compare this to is that like if you look at indexes like the s p i i don't even know what it was last year but i'm guessing it was really good it was probably 20 something like that last year and so literally having 100 capital preservation and having a 20 increase in equities which is here right
(03:21) you'd have a better return there but this one has no increase in equities because we're not participating on the upside we're just participating on the downside which by the way when you ever do money lending all you get is guaranteed cash and you participate on the downside so you really need to make sure the downside is good all right and then the fourth box here is tax advantage these guys make good money and so i was like ten percent i was like you're going to get taxed at 45 right of that 10 which really means your effective
(03:48) increase is going to be 5.5 all right that's how much you're actually going to make on this deal after taxes that's like barely enough to cover inflation and so they're saying risk 450 000 to barely cover inflation not participate in the upside at all be tax disadvantaged and have and do this with a startup so that you're very unlikely to have your capital preserved right so like this is borderline unethical how bad this deal is and so what i want to do now if you guys are good with it is i'll show you the flip side which is the deal that i just
(04:19) did um about 60 days ago all right so here's how this deal worked i wrote a note for 2.5 million dollars all right uh to secure a building out of foreclosure all right so somebody emailed me and said hey um i found this building it's two uh it's 2.5 million dollars that's how much i can buy it for and i said okay well tell me more about this deal so we're going through the same framework all right so we've got capital preservation we've got yield we've got tax and we've got equity all right so in this in this situation um he then
(04:54) said i have four offers on the building already between 5.1 and 5.6 million all right and i was like okay so now i know that this is reasonable and he sent me the offers over so i knew that they were good on top of that they had taken the top guy and this guy had put 300 000 in earnest money down meaning he had committed to doing the deal as soon as he as soon as it comes available all right so we have a real buyer lined up at 5.
(05:24) 6 million sounds good so far and this building is worth 2.5 so i'm thinking capital reservation if if for some reason this deal goes through i've got three other people who've said they've been willing to give more than twice as much money as i'm buying this for all right pretty good now mind you i'm not buying the building i'm the bank here i'm the one lending the money to the guy all right now he's gonna make good money on this he's gonna get two and a half million that's not his money and then he's gonna sell it
(05:50) for 5.1 to 5.6 in this case 5.6 and he's going to end up making 2.1 million on this deal minus whatever my fee is for supplying the money now on top of that i asked to have a personal guarantee from him and the partner all right so just in case these three offers fall through on top of the fourth offer with the earnest money i got personal guarantees by both the buyers of the building all right so this is how i wanted to make sure that my capital is preserved so i'm like cool check now do i participate in any of the equity of this of this
(06:25) business the answer is none i don't have any equity participation from a tax perspective if they're just going to pay me a yield which is exactly how i structured it what am i going to have bad tax treatment you bet your ass i am it's going to be treated as regular income so it's got to be really worth it for me on the yield side and so the way that i wrote the note is i get 48 to 96 per year you're like how can you achieve you know uh returns like that if you look for them right that's the simple answer right and the more deals
(07:00) you do the more people know that you have money that you can do deals and then the more they reach out to you right and if there's not a lot of people who can just snap a hat and just throw out two and a half million dollars and so you get on a higher and higher list and you get access to different deals all right that's the short answer so what they're doing here is that means that i'm getting four percent per month all right now if you do the math on two and a half million four percent per month is a hundred thousand dollars per month
(07:25) now you might be wondering why would anyone pay that this is a bridge loan this is a short-term loan it's called hard money lending private lending private placement different things like that but they need money fast and so they can't go through a normal process because they got a steal on this building right how many times you get a building for two and a half that's worth five immediately right not many and so they need someone who can immediately provide liquidity and in exchange they pay a higher rate now they're not planning on holding the
(07:51) money for the whole year but if i do multiple deals like this then i can effectively get a rate that's comparable to this over the time period of the year all right so four percent per month that's a hundred thousand dollars a month their planned holding time was going to be 60 days i gave them 90 days at this which means in the minimum carry meaning if they did it in two in 24 hours i still get two months of minimum carry meaning if i'm gonna do this deal i have to make at least two hundred thousand dollars on just sending the
(08:20) wire and then getting the money back even if it takes a day like it doesn't matter all right so i set up a minimum carry for that of of times two i'm giving them up to 90 days where they can continue to pay and if it's like 65 days it still rolls into three months right which means then i'm at like three times this right which is 300 000 and so sometimes when people were like why aren't you selling stuff on this channel it's because um i don't really care and so hopefully this makes sense to you if you're thinking if someone emails you
(08:50) god i hope they don't email you but if someone emails you a deal that looks like this one run the other way and you know question their morals and ethics because either they absolutely absolutely have no idea what they're doing or they're expecting that you have no idea what you're doing and so that is why i'm making this video so that you don't do a deal like this you think through it through within uh these these four levels and there is a point because i know i'm going to get this question well at what percentage is it worth
(09:15) getting the yield which is this fourth box here right well i'm going to get taxed on this right at my after tax rate on this is going to be like 27 return so for me 27 return still makes sense after taxes and everything um so that that deal makes sense but it has to be really really good for me because i have a ton of income so i'm gonna get taxed at the highest bracket if it's any kind of regular income type deal and so if you're gonna do a deal like this you have to make sure that it makes sense all right so hopefully that makes sense
(09:44) to you guys hope you enjoyed that uh like subscribe all that stuff and i'll see you guys next video

Why I chose to disappoint my dad - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=To8jcTDwcxc

Transcript:
(00:00) my dad always told me that you only get one name so invest in it accordingly and i always thought about that i thought it was a really good line just like you only get one name like you can change your companies you can go bankrupt but like your name stays with you yeah and so that can either be an asset or it can be a liability well i usually ask my guest how did you get this job so i was a management consultant right out of college i did space cyber intelligence for the military which was sounds much cooler than it really was
(00:31) but i had a top secret clearance it sounded really good at dinner parties and just about only that um and you know one day i looked out for my balcony because i had a really nice place because i could afford it at the time um and i was like is this it and i was you know in my young 20s you know at that point i had done everything that i think i was supposed to do so i was you know i did well in school i you know was president of all the clubs you know graduated in three years got the good job um and i realized that it was i was living
(00:56) you know a life for me that my father wanted me to live and so that was kind of you know i went i i faltered back and forth for probably a period of six months um of really not wanting this to be my life but not wanting to let my dad down and so at some point the the thing that kind of pushed me over the edge was i can either you know die to myself or i can die to my father and at the end of the day you know i have to survive so i will if i if i make this decision and he no longer wants to be my dad then i can
(01:24) accept that wow was that extreme then yes say more about that are you an only child yeah so only child raised by a single father um middle eastern um he was born in iran and um you know i everything in my life up until that point was really just to make him proud so i it was very much a seeking approval seeking validation kind of drive at that point in my life and so the idea of disappointing him or not getting his approval felt like death and at that point i was actually contemplating not living you have watched some of my youtube stuff
(01:54) mortality has been the single biggest driver and the biggest decisions that i've made in my life and it has become a more routine process for decision making for me in general because i think it provides clarity and it provides context to most of the decisions we have which the vast majority of them don't matter which is helpful in and of themselves and then you know beyond that it helps me make the decisions that i think removes everyone else from the playbook because if you if you study subjective well-being and how
(02:22) people perceive how they're doing in their own lives it looks like a smiley face so seven-year-olds think they're killing life and then it drops dramatically between 20 and 30. and then there's still a little bit more of a dip right around 45 that's like when people are their true they hate life the most and then and then it kind of slowly get goes up to like 55 60 and then it shoots right back up again when people see that they're going to die and that life is short and that they can make the decisions without worrying about the
(02:49) ramifications of other people and some of the people they're worried about are also dead and so it was using that context for that biggest decision that's been duplicated many times in my life since then because if i have a good decision-making algorithm i try and reuse it as many times as i can let's unpack it for the audience a little bit so you know when we're seven we don't have a care in the world uh the artist or the whatever we want to be has not been beaten out of us yet uh no one's told us that we are not what we
(03:14) think we are we're still popping wheelies and climbing trees and falling out and that's okay and then you get to your 20s and 30s and the rubber hits the road a little bit and if you've made money i guess and if that's your sign of success then you're okay but if not you're kind of hosed then in your 40s i'm guessing uh you start to have more life experience 50s maybe you start caring less what people think and then um and then you fast forward all the way to maybe near death and then you really get to a point where
(03:47) you don't care what anyone says and you really boil it down to what's important and probably i'm guessing that's love relationships uh legacy and then you just like peace out i think for most people yes for me specifically the legacy piece less so um but i think for most people yes and why is the legacy piece less important um more so and i whenever i get into this topic i think a lot of like some people get sensitive about it and so i just like to put the disclaimer like this is not me judging your beliefs and me
(04:17) stating my beliefs is in no way yeah a judgment on anywhere else um but if you just look at expanding the time horizon over a much longer period of time if you look at it in ten thousand years or a hundred thousand years or a million years right the easy way to test this is to go backwards right which is do you know your great great great great great great grandfather probably not and then if you look at it from a how much has somebody achieved standpoint um i happen to be in an interesting situation where my great great grandfather was in the
(04:42) ruling class in iran and he had 400 children so he was literally you know like ruled and had a lot of wealth he had a lot of wives to create 400 children right and i actually still can't remember his name because my dad told me one time and i can't remember it and i've never seen any of the quote legacy that i'm sure he felt like he was leaving and so if that was that level of success and legacy and only four or five generations later i don't even remember the man's name nor do i have any piece of that legacy yeah
(05:09) it seems a little bit irrelevant when the revolution happened in iran we talk about legacy lands buildings houses bank accounts government says those are ours now that's it there's your legacy gone that's why i'm like and people were like i want to build a legacy i'm like u.s might not even be the superpower in 500 years your kids your kids might be in in bangladesh who knows india might be the hot spot 500.
(05:37) no one knows right and i think in a long enough time verizon we're all screwed and i think in some ways people find that incredibly disheartening but an equal opposite is you can't find it both disheartening and also not freeing because all of the decisions that we're making that are not for ourselves or what or are are subject to change that we feel pressure from whether that be society societal i'll put quotes there because that's a big word um or family friends expectations that we perceive other people to have of us if you can if you can just relinquish
(06:07) all of those chains i think it's incredibly freeing and um i choose to live that way that advice is good because it helps us live in the moment because you know even if you believe in something after that's still in the future yeah and there's a question mark because no one actually knows with you know with knowledge what happens or if something happens so you might as well live in the present make the best of it yeah an interesting one um that i thought through around that was um a lot of us not a lot of us all of us have 100
(06:37) experience uh not being alive right before we were born we were not alive and so we know what that was like there was nothing um that we can recollect and so i would imagine that that's the closest experience that we can have to not being live yet again which to me is not that frightening yeah and it is freeing you're right because it's it's both uh humbling to know that you don't matter in the grand scheme of things but at the same time you matter infinitely if you just focus on the present and the the mark that you're going to
(07:06) leave here and now i i contemplated i had to die to my father died of myself and i realized that i i would rather die to him which pretty much ended up happening and so my fears were relatively justified he was not in support of the things that i wanted to do i ended up quitting that job sold everything i had packed my car went to california because that's what i thought the land of fitness opportunity was because that was the only thing i really enjoyed mentored under a guy for a few months to try and at least learn
(07:29) the ropes started my first facility slept on the floor for the first nine months which was a very terrible experience for me and time stamped the age for me now i was 23. so you graduated early you got that dream job and then you bailed yeah two years and that was really at the time and all of this kind of it was at the a splitting point where i had done two years and the kind of career path traditionally is like two to four years of management consulting and then you go back to an ivy league for your gmat and
(07:56) then from there you go into you know you can you can go do investment banking you can do private equity you can do you know some of the bigger white collar jobs but um it was i just didn't i didn't want more of what i had um and so i thought that i would have a better shot taking 200 000 in two years which is what the you know economic equivalent of what the degree was and starting something on my own i figured i would learn more in the first two years and with that money and maybe even have a business by the end of that period of
(08:21) time that made an equivalent amount of money compared to what i would have had as a job offer but how did you what signals did you get i mean you're saying like i wasn't feeling it but like where was your motivation because i see you as this hustler this go-get is all about gobbling up new opportunities it transcends beyond that now but like at first it sounds like you were just all about the go get but how did you know i mean at first i was driven by fear okay it was all fear fear of failure feel of disappointment fear of other
(08:50) people's judgment right what did your dad end up saying did he say good luck with you no he thought he was stupid though i was wasting my life yeah and wasted a degree that he'd spent money on and yeah wasted a good job opportunity that he had set up for me all these things right in his defense did he immigrate here yeah okay so in his defense 100 right and i just want to tell the audience so that they're not like but it's like you know if you have justified in saying that yeah if you escape from a country where there's trauma
(09:22) and impending danger then your son squanders an opportunity you might get a little anxious about that 100 i mean my dad came here with a thousand dollars you know a medical degree yeah and then built every didn't even speak english right i think what he did was harder than what i've done like i got to i got to stand on his shoulders okay you know in huawei i mean i speak english you know like just the basics like i speak english i went to a good school just all the support infrastructure known and unknown that was around me
(09:53) yeah to you know to be successful yeah i think it's healthy to recognize your privilege yeah but at the same time you know it came with lots of baggage too and so you had signals which were mainly fear-based yeah and i i mean the biggest thing that made the decision for me i would say i had the logical decision and then i had the emotional decision the emotional decision was um i could i don't want to do this this is not the life i want to lead um i am not happy doing this every day i would prefer to not be alive if this is
(10:22) what my life will be continuously if i would prefer to not be alive then that kind of opens up my decision calculus and what was it i'm trying to put my finger on what what was it that made you happy was it just the freedom to do what you want i didn't know what made me happy i knew it was not making me happy okay yeah so i think that's another important lesson too if i can just extract them you know i'm sure a lot of people watching they feel the same kind of family pressure um they want to be what other people expect them to be if
(10:46) you know if that's who you are and that's totally normal um but we should always remember the context in which that advice is given could be given through the lens of a certain lifestyle a certain time frame but like i think that's a thing whether you're young or middle age you're trying to figure out what you want to be when you grow up you're trying to have it all figured out yeah because we don't seems like we don't like uncertainty but i think your message if i'm hearing you is sometimes you have to try it on for size
(11:19) to see if it fits or not and you get it on you're like well i thought that dream job was going to be like perfect but turns out you know it's tight in the crotch you know it's like i i need something different mm-hmm and i think giving yourself permission to do that and it was a side to what you were saying about my dad like education saved his life like he was only able to leave the country because he was educated and so there's very deep roots there and i can appreciate that but for this context or for my life it
(11:46) just wasn't appropriate right and when we did come to terms later um the only time he's ever apologized to me in my life and said but to be fair in my time i would have been right oh absolutely and he would have been it's just not the same time yeah absolutely it wasn't that it was inappropriate it was just out of context and it didn't necessarily translate to this new life i love the saying you know in our 20s we're concerned about what everyone thinks about us in our 40s we don't care what anyone thinks about us and in our
(12:13) 60s we realized that no one was thinking about us to begin with right and i just i just feel like that's i mean who else have you thought about today besides yourself probably not i mean you have your kids which is an extension of yourself but you know i feel like yeah not a lot and so most people are like that and you know a lot of it like we have a lot more leeway than i think we give ourselves credit for and i think the more that i have now you know i'll say accomplished with quotes in in material success the
(12:36) more i am excited about the things that i can do and that was why the opening of the book was like there are no rules and it just took me a very long time to realize that and i continued to unlearn rules that i thought existed you know as i continue to you know go on this journey yeah i love that idea of unlearning i think we all just try and go back to being like we were when we were children just because when you're a child you're purely present right you're just present in the moment and i i don't like the word happy very much i prefer
(13:02) using joy because you can be you can mourn joyfully right because it's it's a it's a it's internal rather than happiness which i feel is more like happenstance it's more from external and so um you know what are the things that bring me joy were the things that i find you know to find joy in um and i think for anyone who's listening it's a much harder question to answer what are the things that bring me joy than answering the question what are the things i hate and it's easier to correct those first you're like well i hate my job and i
(13:32) hate my relationship and i hate the city okay those are all very changeable and a lot of times you get there by by inversion well if i wanted to destroy my life i wanted to have the worst life possible what would i do and then taking all those things that you would do to really destroy your life and make your life miserable and then reverse them it's a much easier way to solve the positive psychology equation in my opinion yeah i love that and i'm remembering this this picasso quote which is i think he said everyone is born an artist yeah right
(14:00) and then eventually we you know get convinced that we're not yeah and we have to really just strip away and get you know get back to basics

Explaining How Anyone Can Make $100M® Offers - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) alex has become a mentor to many a friend to me for sure and uh we're gonna be unpacking his book 100 million offers i do not have the hard copy because we are in lockdown right now and it is lost somewhere but it is right there this book has been hugely impactful for me and our community in real ways there's lots of stuff that you can dig into in the internet marketing world that's like exciting you know you watch a keynote from russell brunson or any of the greats and you're like freaking pumped out of your mind you believe you're one funnel away but reading a book i was like [ __ ]
(00:35) there's like so much good stuff in here it feels like it it's gonna work and then we applied it and lo and behold uh it worked but but here's where i want to start with you alex so our audience high ticket entrepreneurs when i talk to coaches and consultants about improving their offer they typically think like no i'm good like clients are getting great results we just need more calls we need better marketing and so i want you to start by sharing like what's the difference between an offer and a coaching program and then can you talk to us about why you always want to start with the offer
(01:06) i actually wrote the third book in the second book first and i wrote this book which is now the first book that came out third uh and hopefully you tracked what i just said because i barely did um and the reason i had to do that was with each book i started with the third book and i was like i actually kind of need this second book to make sense which was lead generation i was like well i finished the second book and i was like you know what if their offer is crap then that's not going to matter anyway so i have to
(01:29) start with the offer and so it kind of went in reverse and it's because like as i'm thinking through it i started thinking about the things that i would immediately want to look at in a business but usually there's these other weaknesses that are much stronger and from a speed to money standpoint changing someone's offer is about the easiest thing that you can do and a better business intervention um and the offer touches so many components of the business right so it touches the lead generation component so you get more people who are going to respond than who otherwise would have
(01:57) with a superior offer you get more people to buy than who otherwise would have you get higher pricing and more and more profit as a result of a better offer than you otherwise would and so with each of those situations they become multiplicative in their effects on the business and when you put them all together the offer is the lever on all of them and so i could you know for most businesses you could just turn the entire business around by fixing this one thing once that one thing is fixed then you get into okay how much how many different channels can we have access to
(02:23) to generate leads you know the third book is money model so how many different ways can we can we monetize the customer to increase our you know our cash conversion cycle or basically how quickly return a dollar so we can spend more uh on the acquisition which is the third book the reason we start with the offer is because i think in the marketing community at large and i say that uh because just about here everybody here is in the marketing community at large um this book i think was a hit at least i
(02:46) perceive it as a hit because it was the only book that i think has talked about the product and so no one talks about product in the marketing community and so i think it seems so far into many people but if you look in the software world they only talk about product and they don't care at all about marketing uh because they know and if you will allow me to expand on this for a quick second and then we can i'll get into the questions i'm gonna i'll share something with you that's been very very um impactful for me so a lot of people look at jim launch
(03:12) and they try and understand the success behind the company and for context for everyone here the first year i was in business in gym lunch uh at least once we switched the licensing model we took home 17 million dollars in profit for perspective let me pause for a second it was as [ __ ] insane for me as it might sound to you so it is not lost on me and we went from 3 million in profit the year before to 17. um and a lot of people looked at our funnels they thought you know alex's sales genie or it's it's it's our it's
(03:42) our creative it's our hooks it's all it's all these things and many people try to copy them but no one was able to duplicate the numbers and success in the scale um and it was because the product was superior i mean i see mark was here i know mark was one of our early clients he had a gym i guess now he's doing high ticket which is awesome the average client made 30 000 in their first 30 days that was the average which means half of people did better than that and so if you look at the internet marketing community at large i would i would doubt that there are many offers
(04:11) that produce that kind of result and so we were able to get 36 to one return on advertising and actually the first year we got a hundred to one return on our advertising um because honestly the advertising wasn't the thing that was doing the vast majority of the work it was word of mouth it was referrals and so people might see the ad but they had heard about it in three or four other places and i'm told that the book is having a similar effect it's on people's news feeds and things like that and for context everyone here there's no book funnel there's no upsells i've spent no
(04:39) dollars on advertising and it sells a thousand copies a day right now with no advertising i got reached out to people like hey man how are you how did you achieve this organic something with the with the book and i was like we just tried to write a really good book um and i think that it's it's it's often overlooked and so this is the piece that i'll finish with and then we'll we can we can rock in but if you think about the six acquisition channels that exist from clients right you've got paid media which is advertising of any kind you've got owned media which is your list of
(05:10) all your people you've got earned media which is the platforms that'll distribute your stuff organically like we're on facebook right now so this is an organic hones that's earned media right and then you've got the three people based which is you got manual outbound uh you've got affiliates and then you've got referrals and word word-of-mouth of those six that i just named five of them are linear in nature what i mean by that is that if i put a hundred dollars in i get a set or fixed ratio back so i put a hundred in i can get a
(05:34) thousand out where i do a hundred calls and i get x appointments right it's the same if there's a fixed ratio and then you just increase in scale right and with most of those they're diminishing in nature in terms of the more scale you add the return ratio diminishes with referrals word of mouth it is quadratic which means it's exponential and so it is the hardest one to achieve but once you achieve it it is the one that will pay you so handsomely that is worth the disproportionate investment of time and
(06:02) the difference between a good book and a great book is large this made a great book an exceptional or remarkable book or remark worthy as in it was so good that you had to tell someone about it is even harder right but that extra uh the extra amount that extra increment of return yields outsized returns in terms of the practical use of that value and so i think that for us so many people just you know slap a bunch of videos together and say this is my course uh rather than having the in-depth or trench knowledge to go from being good to great or going from great to being exceptional
(06:34) and i will tell you that having now which is weird i i feel like uh an older person in the internet marketing space now which is hilarious in terms of years uh in it rather than age the people who who continue uh to live on uh and not fizzle and pop are the ones who have superior product because usually the people who do not uh wither from the stress or the pressure of unhappy high ticket clients and so the only way you can weather that emotionally unless you have no conscience is by having a superior product and having intentions of truly always
(07:10) improving the products so that you can weather those storms because you and only you can know your intentions i think that would be at least my word to this and my test with acquisition.com which if you read in the book is kind of the venture that that i've been focusing on for the last year my goal with that business were really the portfolio of businesses is to grow it exclusively off of inbound because of the other five channels i've grown each of those to multiply figures in terms of how much i've been able to generate from them but i have never done um one off of kind of earned media and
(07:40) purely inbound and so um that was the goal and in order to do that we had to make sure that the product was truly exceptional and i can tell you that if the people that make much more money than me it seems to be a constant in that it is a one-time investment to make a superior product that has compounding returns most of the wealthiest people that i know try and invest in something one-time that will pay them forever whereas most of the poorest people i know try and consistently have to do things that they have to do over and over and over and over again you have to
(08:04) make new campaigns you have to make new reach outs you have to make new phone calls those are all things that you have to do in order to keep going and as soon as you stop them the business ends but if the product is superior the product will run on its own and coincidentally the profit is extremely great because you have no cost of acquisition you touched on a couple things there and obviously a big focus of what you see this around superior product but i would say um 100 agree but i would say also
(08:29) people can't uh distinguish the fact between the reality of the quality of a product and deception in the market right so can you talk a bit more about how your product is both your offer and it's not right it's not just about adding two more coaching calls a week it's not like i have my community on facebook or some other platform can you talk a bit more about like what that looks like with the offer it's kind of it it's kind of this really interesting thing of the it's the bridge between prospect and client right and so it has components of
(08:59) both sides it has components of promotion embedded within it but it also has components of product and so the offer is really communicating across the bridge what it's like to be a client to a prospect and so we're thinking about what are the problems what are every single problem both known and unknown and a little pro tip because if you read the books how i do it uh pro tip for everybody if you want to include bonuses include one or two bonuses that solve a problem that only occurs upon success so for example if i was taking on a
(09:30) company for acquisition.com then a bonus might be i'll also you know introduce you to all my tax shelter people also introduce you to my legal team also introduced my investor people who will help you um keep more of the money that we're going to be making right so we're going to solve a problem that's going to assume success and so all of a sudden your prospect is going to have a higher belief in that they're going to achieve it because why what other reason would you be solving problems uh that that assumed
(09:55) success right unless people were being successful to circle back to what you were saying earlier dan the perception right of the product um has to be the thing that appears valuable and your ability to do that will also be predicated on the true value of the product so it is it is both ways right um but the idea is and i think this might be contrary to some of the things that are in the internet marketing communities that i believe that you should solve every prospect's problem most things operate like a
(10:19) pipeline and so if you have 100 steps if you miss 99 it still won't work it's like a car engine like is there a more important part in the car engine than another part well they're all required so they are requisite pieces and i think most times people solve one or two of the things they might bring an engine uh and they might bring gasoline but they don't have wheels or they don't have spokes or they might not even have the nuts on the wheels right uh to keep them on and so it's really thinking through and i think that's where the the depth of knowledge is so important where like
(10:49) i tell this story and hopefully it'll illustrate the point here i believe in doing the really ugly unscalable stuff first so that you can have the depth of knowledge to to do the scalable thing a lot of people want to jump the gun and go straight to i mean i can't tell you the amount of times i've talked to quote agency owners who are like man these realtors can't make money on my leads and i actually had a a an agency that i worked with for almost a year on our software platform and every month i would just say why don't you just get a real estate license and actually work your leads
(11:21) and finally he did it and in his first month he made five times more money than he did three years prior because he actually knew what the [ __ ] he was talking about right and so gym launch became as big as it was because i spent two years on the road launching 33 different gyms in different markets in person working the front desk so we knew the nuances and the differences of what time of day to call and what cadence then what text to use in this type of market what types using this type of market and we were able to troubleshoot those things so easily and successfully that our client
(11:49) saw a disproportionate amount of success and then in the sales call and when in creating the offer we could say hey if you're if you're familiar with orange clapham talks about a flash troll right which is where you talk about all these little features and problems that they haven't even encountered yet that you have already solved and then in so doing you demonstrate such superior expertise to the person that they immediately trust you as an authority and then all of a sudden the remainder of the conversation
(12:12) is very easy because they know that they don't even have the perspective from which to make a judgment they transfer that that authority over to you to make a judgment on their behalf so i want you to kind of go deeper on something you just said because uh tied to that i've heard you talk about this a lot which is that people try and solve problems that don't exist when it comes to the scalability of their offer if they're scared to offer too much and they have zero clients or a few clients they go i just don't know how this is
(12:34) going to look at 50. and so can you talk about the kind of those spectrums of like easy to sell hard to sell easy to deliver hard to deliver so i think that most entrepreneurs would be best served especially in the beginning and so it's hard to make broad sweeping statements because there's always exceptions to them but by and large most entrepreneurs who are probably in this community selling high ticket coaching services would be best served selling a less scalable offer at higher ticket first and then piece by piece removing pieces that are less scalable and so you do
(13:06) that because you give higher touch to clients you have more more profit in your acquisition because most done for you models for example uh if done properly i'm not saying agency models because i'm not a big fan of agency models but um most done free models if done properly should yield excess cash and the issue becomes operational fulfillment right which is how i prefer to have my bottleneck in the operations and scale than in demand generation that is just my preference some people prefer different ways i prefer it that way um and so the easier something is to sell
(13:35) in general which is going to require more handholding in your part more services more things the easier it is to sell right on the flip side if you just sell a course via webinar it becomes very very difficult to sell in general you have to have very very high persuasive abilities in order to sell that and a pretty unique opportunity right if you're telling how to make how to run facebook ads i think that time has somewhat come and gone right and so uh the idea is i would prefer to be on the easier to sell part of the spectrum gain the experience generate the cash flow and then use the cash for to solve
(14:04) future problems of scale um and i think that that is a better sequence that has a higher likelihood of success for most people yeah and i would say there's a huge assumption baked into that which comes down to a really wildly uncommon opinion you have which is on pricing because all of that assumes that you're going to have then excess cash and enough to deliver and that it's priced right so can you talk a bit more about pricing because i think for most people we do what dan kennedy calls the wag pricing model which is just the wild ass guess or the industry norm right where
(14:36) you just go like what does this person do what does this person do great i'll be somewhere in the middle or a little bit cheaper so when we got into that you know in our first coaching business um which was obviously gym launch we uh the highest priced person at the time was 5k uh the lowest price people were kind of agencies doing 500 bucks a month so that was kind of the range of the marketplace and so when we came in our front-end program was 16k our back-end program was actually a three-year 126k program so the pricing was so vastly different than
(15:02) everyone else that it caused the prospects to take pause and say there must be something different going on here paul is there and then if you think about what a lot of people are seeing with the book or at least i'm told is that the book's kind of all over a lot of people's news feeds imagine you have this kind of pricing with all of this word of mouth that's surrounding it and then it creates this allure right and so the idea is that we have to charge so much in order to get the clients and prospects more invested
(15:25) because a in a very real way price confers value right so there's a story on the book but it's it's it's basically if you had three people thread try three different wines the high price the middle price and the low price and then rate them most people rate the highest price wine the best but the thing is is that when they do these studies they actually make all three wines the same and so in a very real way price does confer value your product that's number one number two is that if you change the
(15:49) quality or increase the quality of your prospects you will increase the quality of your products so what i mean by that is if i am working with uh somebody who's making five million dollars a year right and then i give them a book right dan all of a sudden that book to dan is worth two million dollars this year right if i give that to somebody who's never started a business before the book might be worth some inspiration and so there's a very real difference in the value that my product delivered based on the quality of my prospect independent of the change in my product
(16:22) and so the second point is that if you change and increase the quality of your prospects you can also charge your concurrently higher price based on the value that is true that you were delivering to that person the third piece is that i like having pricing power in general because there is a strong strategic advantage to being higher priced i just named two of them right in the marketplace but one of the biggest ones is that you have so much more gross profits left over that a you can spend more on the acquisition but b
(16:46) you can do things that other people can't and so you further eliminate or or separate yourself from the competition by being able to provide things that no one else can right so for example in the gym launch world because we had a lot of clients that are we still continue to have a lot of clients that are in the same markets we were able to spend 50 000 a month every month on testing advertisements and then we would just license those ads out to all of the facilities across right no one else could do that because i had the spare cash that i could just put into marketing and then only hand scratch off
(17:15) lottery winners to them that they could just go and cash in right because they already knew they worked and so i could hire a team just to build all this stuff for them and there weren't even franchisors at that time that we were doing that stuff and honestly they still don't and so we're able to still run a very high growth profit on even that product line and so the idea is like how can i do things that no one else can do and the thing is is i would start with the price first now obviously it has to be based in reality in terms of the value you can provide but a lot of times
(17:38) with the access gross profit you can in a very real way provide more value and so that's why in the book i like to anchor the pricing in the beginning because that just kind of sets the stage but then when we get into the value creation side of it it's like how can i how can i make it so likely that they are successful how can i get them to be successful in half the time and how can i do it so i can eliminate effort and sacrifice and for those who don't know the difference between effort and sacrifice effort is what someone has to
(18:02) do that they don't want to do that they weren't doing before they started working with you sacrifice is when they have to stop doing something that they enjoy doing that they were doing before they started working with you that they can no longer do and so the idea is how can i limit eliminate the effort and sacrifice cut the time in half and then increase the perceived likelihood that they're going to achieve the result that they want and so that was kind of the basis i mean in general if there was one summary picture for the book in terms of how to create value it's the value
(18:26) equation and so the remainder of the book is basically the executions the tactics around how do we actually do this how do we create a dream outcome that's appealing to the person right making a million dollars for most men is more appealing than being more handsome not saying that they don't want both but they probably want one more and in a real way a lot of guys would spend five hundred thousand dollars to make a million dollars but probably wouldn't spend five hundred thousand dollars to be more handsome or maybe they would but it depends on their income right
(18:50) perceived likely of achievement i'll give you an example here so if if you guys were if you had your if for i see a lot of guys on here but if your wife were getting uh plastic surgery or you're getting plastic surgery whatever right you have two surgeons that have the exact same they're gonna do the exact same surgery on you right the outcome's the same now so i'm i'm controlling for the outcome and showing you different pieces of the value equation if one of them was about to do their first surgery ever out of medical
(19:13) school and the other one was on their 10 000th surgery in their career which of them would you rather work with this one which one would you rather pay more this one you probably asked this guy to pay you because you were his first surgery right and so in a very real way the perceived likelihood of its achievement increases the value independent of the actual service being delivered and so that is why it's the second thing now most marketers focus all their attention on the top side of the equation this is what i did for the first few years of my career when i was at my gyms when i sold weight loss and
(19:44) then even in the beginning of gym launch it was all about how much money are you going to make and then [ __ ] loads of testimonials how much money you're going to make [ __ ] loads of testimonials but there are other ways to increase perceived likelihood of achievement which is kind of goes back to that flash role argument i was saying earlier which is here are all the things that you didn't even think about that i have already handled uh on your journey that you didn't even foresee which then shows
(20:03) my expertise that i know what i'm doing and so the goal is to increase these as much as possible now the second half of the equation are the detractors in a very real way in my opinion the bottom side of the equation is actually more powerful in persuasion than the top side and the reason is because it's very easy to make claims it's very easy to talk about the dream outcome right but it's much more difficult to actually decrease the time delay which why for us one of the major kpis we've always had as a company is how
(20:29) much cash someone generates in the first 14 days working with us right and so for us we drive towards that equation and for us right now for example the average cash collected in the first 14 days is 15 500 right for our client that is the average right and so with that i can have a big outcome in the first you know 14 days so they have a very short time delay between when they when they buy something and they begin to start experiencing the results right and so i'll give you a simple way of providing value look at what everyone else is doing in the market and do it in half the time right if all of a sudden for example as
(21:00) an extreme version of this i would say hey i'm selling a weight loss product i use weight loss because everyone understands it all right and as soon as you click this you look at you you pull your shirt up and you have a six-pack right you buy my six-pack program you click purchase and you have a six-pack immediately how valuable would that product be extraordinarily right and so the idea is we made the product more valuable not by changing the outcome not by changing the perceived like of achievement but by simply changing the time in which
(21:30) it took to achieve the outcome that was promised and so as a marketing example for example if i had a a marketing agency again which i'm not a huge fan of but if you had a marketing agency that was commoditized service based right if i were trying to provide more value i would say as soon as as soon as the contract is signed if the prospect's phone rang figuratively or their inbox you know was filled and they got a book call immediately with a qualified prospect that was booked 30 minutes after they got off the phone with you
(21:58) how much more valuable would that be than somebody that says hey it's gonna take 30 days to ramp up it'll take another 30 days to start seeing results so it's like 30 days after that for you to recoup and break even and then by month six but like you have i've already lost you right so much less valuable and so the idea is the time delay component is a massive area of value and if you look at the biggest companies in the world they look at time as one of the major drivers of value time is thing that most people value more than anything uber came in because it was
(22:23) more convenient right netflix came in because it was more convenient than doing the other things right which also ties into the second part of the bottom equation which is effort and sacrifice right and so the idea is again if i like weight loss again i'll just use the example we we asked susie right to give up waking up you know sleeping in right because she's got to wake up early to go to the gym right now she's sore every day so now she's got she's got effort and sacrifice that are associated she can't eat any of the foods that she likes anymore she's got to eat separate from her family her kids are making fun
(22:53) of her she goes out she misses her she can't drink champagne at her at her sister's wedding on top of that all like everything that she loves about life is gone right and and here's the best part it's gonna take her 12 months to maybe look a little better but still not be at her goal so no wonder it's so [ __ ] hard to sell and so the idea is how can we eliminate as many of these barriers as possible in the effort and sacrifice component so that we can make it as instant and as fast for them and the
(23:17) reason i made it a fraction is because in theory if you can get the bottom side of the equation to zero as in it's instant and there's no effort in the sacrifice then you have an infinitely valuable product right and if you think about like what amazon's doing right they're getting so close to literally you just like click one button on your phone or maybe it's i mean very soon it'll just be you talk out loud your phone will hear you through a lexus alexa and then a drone drops it off at your at your house two hours later
(23:45) they are shrinking that gap the effort and sacrifice and the time delay so much that the value becomes so infinite infinite and that's why they're becoming such a behemoth right and so when i think about products and how do we create value because a lot of people throw the term out right they're like god they've got to give value got to create value if you're like what is value like and so this is my best attempt at at writing down or at least compartmentalizing what i believe value to be in an equation so you can look at your own products and say how do we measure up here and perceive likelihood how do we measure pure effort and
(24:14) sacrifice how can we make things happen faster for them is there a dream outcome that we can communicate in a way that's more compelling or more relatable i'll give you a hack so one of the things that we did on our onboarding process that we switched was um so our so our sales team takes no string sales calls and they close the sale and they transfer over to the onboarding team and so for a very long time it was just hey so it says seems here that your goal is you're trying to make an extra ten thousand dollars a month awesome that's
(24:38) gonna help you do cool and so they were already impressed because we actually read the notes that were from their sales call mind blowing right but it increased their perceived likelihood of achievement because they're like oh these people are buttoned up right crazy by the way to have a handoff between sales and the first which they talk to after they give you money anyways what we started doing was we started asking them on the sales calls of course what is that like why is that why is ten thousand dollars the number why is that meaningful for you why not why not
(25:02) twenty eight thousand why not five thousand right like was there is there something as a result of having ten thousand dollars that is going to change in your life in one way or another because if there weren't there would there'd be no point in even making the money and so then they tell you the real reason which is uh you know we've got two kids and i really wish my wife could be at home with them whatever right and so what we do in the onboarding call is now we can tie more accurately hey so it shows here that what you're trying to do
(25:25) is trying to retire your wife all right so that's what we're going to try and help you do here with the program and what i need you to do in order to do that is you got to follow these steps so now all of a sudden we got way higher buy-in way higher compliance and we actually had higher conversions on the back end simply by changing the on-boarding process and not even changing the product you could make the argument change the auditing process is a part of the product but hopefully you understand my point so if you can more accurately depict the dream outcome to your prospect they will value it in a
(25:48) better way it'll also increase the perceived likelihood that's super good man and i i want to get your thoughts on something that i know that a good portion of the 130 people with us right now are probably thinking which is that they need to upgrade their market oh i want to charge more money so i'm going to go find the people that have more money and i can't tell you how often people like you know what are you qualifying for and say the dm's to get someone into a call they're like oh they've got to be making six figures i'm like why and they're like because they you know it's easier for them to pay for
(26:19) my program whatever it might be can you talk really quickly about niche slapping which is a big thing for us in the coaching space and then also the economics behind your pricing of gym launch and how much money the average gym owner makes yeah so those are a couple of things so i'll start in reverse order of what i remember from the question so uh so the average gym owner makes uh 29.
(26:43) 50 a month of take-home income on about a 300 000 a year uh uh business right brick and mortar and so you're talking about 36 thousand dollars a year roughly um in take-home income it depends on the source of the data but it's around 30 to 36. and so our program was 16 000 up front right um and then the back-end program was 42 000 which is literally more than someone makes in a year and so the the idea so i'm not against you finding higher quality prospects if you can make your product so good that it will pay for itself immediately then
(27:12) that is where you really unlock basically unlimited money right if you can help people actually make the money to pay for your program rather than asking them to pay for the program and then get the result you you're tapping into like the universe right you don't you know there's no there's no limit on the amount of money that you can make and the reason that we were able to make so much is because we made so many people so much money like that's the real like there's no other secret to that like we made a lot of people a lot of money and
(27:36) as a result of that they were happy to pay us for the money that we were making them most people couldn't afford i would say 50 of the gyms that we sign up can't afford the next month's payment if we don't make the money so we have to make the money which is why most gym competitors have entered the space have never been able to get to a tenth of our size right it's because they they weren't able to operationalize the value the way we were able to so that's that's in terms of like the the value compared to the price in terms of the income of
(28:00) the person in terms of niche slapping the simplest answer i can give you might be might be a story so i was talking to again agency owner but i guess we live in the marketing world right different different agencies this is an agency coach all right so he coaches agencies he's like hey i'm getting all these dms about doing general business um do you think i should go into general business and i said i think that's a terrible idea there's a couple reasons one because i didn't think he had earned it yet um but second and probably more
(28:25) importantly the question is i was like have you reached the market cap the answer is no of course not doing 5 million a year in an industry that does 20 billion or 50 billion whatever it is in the entire marketing agency space he's probably not pretty close right so he had risen to his level of incompetence and so it didn't really matter him switching the niche that he was going to he was just going to rise up to his next level of incompetence which is going to be the same as what it is now but more realistically he would drop to two and a half on here raised to two and a half on here now be ceo of two
(28:54) businesses which you can only have like think about this how many publicly traded companies have a ceo that is being ceo of home depot and ceo of coca-cola he's like well i'm doing both right i'm running two companies because i'm gonna figure out which one explodes it's [ __ ] stupid right it's [ __ ] and yeah we do it all the time as entrepreneurs and so you have to pick and then you have to commit and then the hardships that you experience are the things that you have to perceive or at least for me that i perceive as barriers that no one else
(29:22) will go through there is that when i encounter them once i solve them someone else who comes behind me will encounter them and not know how to solve them and the more of these rungs that i pass the more difficult it is for someone to achieve the same thing and so at any of the markets but i tend to ask when people come to me i see what like let's say somebody's making five billion dollars a year i would just ask them because they're like hey man i'm thinking about switching about switching markets and i'm like
(29:46) well why they're like well i want to make more money i'm like cool i'm like well why don't you just double your business and still have one business and then inevitably with enough questions it's the answer becomes because i just don't know how right it's like well then let's solve that problem and then grow the business rather than just feed our egos and have a quick win because you have a couple dms of people who say they want general business coaching which will then inevitably flounder once you get into the real space against dudes who make way more money than you are much better at
(30:14) business and so like the reason you niche down is because you don't want to you don't want to fight against bigger competitors there is a time to become tony robbins right but most people aren't there and so it's much better to cater your marketing and your messaging and your product to an individual and in so doing provide outsized returns and value which you can then capitalize on right if i had a generic facebook ads program five years ago i might have made a few million dollars but because i was able to say hey i'm gonna copy and paste this here's every [ __ ] step of this
(30:42) process to turn eyeballs into gold immediately because i didn't have to tailor it right everything out of the box was exactly the way it needed to be for that prospect right so nothing else needed to change whereas the more wiggle you have in your product because it's individualized and variable between markets and avatars and things like that then all of a sudden your your value drops because you can provide because you're providing less of it in a very real way because otherwise every single one of the clients should have a
(31:12) personally catered uh program but you can't do that because you're not committing to a niche yeah chris just said there's so much to unpack here hurts um there was someone here i know that's uh being in our pipeline for all 50 years old uh runs a real estate coaching company he's just like this live is changing my life so when we're talking about an offer i think most everyone gets how this impacts the very end of their sales and marketing process in that short time at the end of a call where we go i think i can help would you like me to share a bit more about what that would look like right and and that's
(31:46) what we think that you're telling us to do is create something that makes that part really easy and of course having a great offer makes that part easier how do you feel like we should be thinking about and utilizing a grand slam offer to improve our marketing is it simply talking more about what it is that we do how do you think about that i think each of the bonuses that i was talking about kind of that flash roll of all of the all the problems that your prospect doesn't perceive yet like that in my opinion b2b advertising is all about demonstrating expertise in advance when
(32:16) you're creating a grand slam offer you have so many problems that are being solved that you can speak to them and ideally i would like to speak to them in a way that i know my competition is not solving them and so by doing that i'm strengthening myself and at the same time throwing rocks against my competitors because i know that i'm solving problems that they aren't and i'm doing that because i've actually done it and they have not and they're making it up because they're looking because they bought a course and how to
(32:37) be a guru and they never actually did [ __ ] right and so and many of your competitors are the same way of course not you because you're listening to this and that's not you of course but other people other people your competitors right are like that right and so the way to to get around that and be able to use the offer is again and have the in-depth knowledge of every single problem that's going to happen and then your marketing takes on its own unique language because everyone else tries to talk in features and benefits and promises and you can think this is what it means but when you can
(33:06) talk about the problems in a very specific way because you've experienced them because you went through it because you know that suzie's always going to [ __ ] complain about the music in the gym the bathrooms aren't clean enough mark might get a laugh out of that only a gym owner would know that but a marketer who's never been a gym owner wouldn't know that right [ __ ] susie right exactly the point is is that if you know the pains then in your marketing my offer is going to have components right so i might cover some of those aspects that i know are nuanced pains and solve problems that no one
(33:36) else is solving because i'm talking about something else was talking about because i actually did it and i'm saying i is all of us not not me specifically tell us about your marketing plan right now and what we can learn from it because you're giving away all this stuff for free and i think there is this huge lie in our industry which is we we should keep our marketing like we hear like nifty things like we we show our know-how but give know how right and so it's like oh we demonstrate we know we're talking about but we actually help
(34:07) no one and hopefully they're you know agitated enough they jump on a call and you're kind of taking this very different approach and in my experience with gym launch marketing it's always been different you've actually provided a stack of value up front so much so that probably makes competitors who provide that same stuff or similar for paid in their program pretty scared so so coach us on that for a second we all do marketing whether it's organic or paid how should we be thinking about demonstrating value and giving stuff away can we hold on there because i want to add one thing to the last question
(34:37) that i think would be a really good thought so from the offer perspective to effect marketing i want to give an extreme example because it came to me as you were saying that if you said i will get you this outcome for free guaranteed or pay you twice as much as you paid me how difficult do you think it will be to acquire customers not hard it wouldn't be hard right at all and so what ended up happening would be the bottleneck would become your operational your operations right isn't that so much better of a problem because then you have flow that you can
(35:07) then consistently test things on and fix the operations right as you [ __ ] up which you inevitably will in the beginning and then you eventually get it right and the other piece of that is that's an extreme example of like it's free i'll get to this crazy outcome and if you don't i'll pay you twice as much and if you're like alex that's insane what do you think i did for two years flying out to gyms for no cost to them i literally sat at their front desk for three and a half weeks in the middle of nowhere spent my own money on advertising paid
(35:35) for my own hotel my own flights made the calls made the sales myself did the onboarding and introduction of the nutrition plans where i would sell them supplements and i did all of that and that you know how to do anything so if you're like this guy's saying something that's totally unreasonable i did it for two years and so like i say that because i really do believe in this right and so if you the idea is how can i give away a crazy offer that no one would say no to and think how can i get no one to say no to this right and if you're afraid of it that's okay
(36:05) that's fear you know i'll just i'll leave it at that anyways and so if you want to right if you want if you want to [ __ ] out a little bit you can just take one step back and say okay well everyone would say yes to this maybe 90 of people say yes to this and this is something that i'm willing to do okay cool right and so the idea is how how few of these pieces can i peel back versus the other extreme which is hey buy my thing maybe you get results maybe you don't i don't care i got paid either way it's your fault which is for the most part most coaching offers
(36:36) think about that right and if you're like man i'm not confident enough that we're going to be able to deliver on those promises then fix the [ __ ] product right and stop selling the [ __ ] you're selling well it's like the why are you selling it to begin with if you can't have the strong offer and the strong guarantee behind it then the product sucks then you're never going to make a ton of money because the product sucks and you're never going to be able to market it and here's a mind [ __ ] for you all right so i told you that you have a compound there's six channels
(36:59) right and one of them compounds and is quadratic the reason the other reason sony the people end up fizzling and popping when they become gurus is because the word of mouth marketing that is working against them outpaces them they sold enough people and enough people told enough people about how much their [ __ ] sucked that no one responds to their ads anymore because you either have a positive quadratic force behind you that is just feeding you every day where you have a negative quadratic force behind you but the word of mouth is always happening it's just whether you're controlling it or not or
(37:28) whether you know about it or not and so anyways i just wanted to touch on that based on the last question but the question that you just asked just repeat it real quick just for everybody on here well i just want to touch on something you just said which is this solves the age old challenge uh that people are especially experiencing now which is the coaching industry is more saturated than it's ever been right and there are 101 people that are promising the same thing that have the same deliverables in their program more or less and you're now trying to figure
(37:54) out how to stand out of the marketplace and the answer is like be bitter like that's really what i'm hearing you say it's not like we're not trying to be better wordsmiths or write greater copy it's like actually create a product that's superior so marketing is about different businesses about better so everyone talks about blue ocean but you don't need to be blue ocean in the product the product just needs to be better and so many times the incremental improvements over time do add up and they do create outsized returns it's
(38:17) just hard because it's boring no one's like oh man we should improve our own boarding process that's boring that's not sexy you do a hundred of those and all of a sudden a vast majority of your clients are getting results right and then all of a sudden they're like no this program is awesome when someone hears about it they tell their friends and then that friend might not immediately sign up but they might go by your book they might go join your group right or they might actually now respond to the ad that they've seen 10 times and be like well i did hear something about dan so maybe i will check it out so in
(38:42) my opinion i think the word of mouth actually becomes the first tip of the dynamo domino and the paid ads actually kind of function as as retargeting even if it's cold you just don't know that they have now been they've now touched your brand in some way and once they've had one word of mouth or two word of mouth now they will respond to the ad that is called traffic and as far as hiros or whatever it is you know whatever you're tracking is right in your in that thing it looks like it's new but it's not they already got touched in other ways and
(39:12) then walked in so i think much more in terms of differentiating yourself in the marketplaces you have to have a parallel marketing campaign that is going on on your behalf behind the scenes and um one of the questions that i think is very haunting but i think is very powerful is right now if i if i were the god of of marketing right thor god of marketing right and i said right now you can get no more customers from any any any acquisition methods you're using all right so you can't do you can't do affiliates you can't do paid ads you can't do reach outs you can't do any of that stuff all right the only way you can get new customers
(39:44) is if your existing customers bring you more customers how different would the experience you have with your customers look if that was the only way you could get new clients and if you can think right now how different it would look how much interaction you would have how much support would be there how you'd make sure everyone was successful then change that now and then they will come so going back to that question of giving away too much and this temptation to be really shallow in our marketing and it kind of flicks our expert muscles but not enough to
(40:13) actually help people you take a very different approach coach us on that um it's kind of like the the age old like what happens if i train an employee and then they leave it's like what happens if you never train them and they stay right and so it just faces the inevitability that you're like you got to train all your employees right or you got to invest in all your employees and i think you can use the same kind of thought process which is well 99 of people what if i give them all this value and they don't buy right well it's like what if you give
(40:44) them no value right and all they consume is your fluff and so it's been my opinion that 99 of the marketplace will never buy from it and so there's the there's the human side of it and then there's the money side so first just touching on the human side of it i sleep better at night knowing or at least believing that more people benefit from the stuff that we give out right i feel like that's a net positive just in general right so that and i think most entrepreneurs i talk to they say hey i want to make an impact i want to help people to the degree which that's true i don't know but whatever it sounds nice and so i
(41:15) think that if that is true for you then why not give away more um in a recent goal for myself as a total tangent but i'm going to go for it anyways is to is to die the man who gave them most um and that's i maybe i'll never achieve that but it's a nice goal for me um on the money side a couple things one is if you give enough you don't have to ask so you've heard of the jab jab jab right hook thing right let me tell you real [ __ ] secret you can just jab jab jab and never ride hook and people will just lay down
(41:45) and say you win the amount of dms i get a day that offer me between 50 and 250 000 for a day or an hour per day is staggering that's not an offer i have that's nothing and i don't sell it right but because there's been enough value that they believe has been i've there's a threshold that has been met or surpassed and they're like and most people have reciprocity most people are normal people and if they receive something they want to give something back and the idea behind marketing in my opinion is to trigger that in people
(42:19) is how can it give them so much that they would feel unreasonable or guilty to not pay me and i can't tell you the amount of times where i had somebody who read the gym launch book which is the first book i wrote a few years ago for the gym industry and uh they read the book and they're like dude your book tripled my business i i'm here a year later and um i just i had to you know i had to see what he's like you could do nothing and i would just be happy to sign up right and i think that in terms of the fear of giving stuff away it's pure scarcity and i'll define that because i think scarcity and abundance
(42:49) are thrown around a lot in the marketing community but no one actually like defines it kind of like value and so my definition of abundance is or being abundant is being someone who cannot be controlled because they need nothing and so if i don't need anything you cannot incentivize me and therefore i cannot be controlled which means i'm purely autonomous which means i don't need to give you anything to get something back because i don't need what you have and so i think what ends up happening when
(43:15) you do this very valued value-centric or value first approach is that you inevitably end up playing the long game and as a further tangent which hopefully then will let me expound upon i think that one of the most undertalked about concepts in the marketplace is goodwill and i think that goodwill compounds and i think it compounds fast food than revenue you can get outsized returns on providing value into a pool of a marketplace and that goodwill will multiply far faster than your asking will and if
(43:45) you can hold off long enough you won't ever need to ask you can just keep giving and so the idea of like when am i giving enough is chilly like give everything you have and the reality is that most of the stuff you have and i'm saying this not as a pejorative statement i'm saying this is in general most of stuff you have might not be that good and what it will do is it will force you to get better and if there's ever been like a single consolidated statement of like what alex believes about making money it's people just need to be much better than they are
(44:21) and most people suck at most things they do especially the things they think they're good at a lot of you probably would think your competitors are not that good your competitors don't think you're that good and so the question is how can we how can we make it so it's so unreasonable for them to like i used to and this used to be in part of my marketing i was like people might say that they don't like our methods i was like but no one's ever said jim doesn't make people money what are the biggest mistakes or i would say what is your advice to us to get to
(44:49) for everyone under a million in revenue to get to a million in revenue from like high-level business principles and then and this is the this is the key part that you were 100 qualified to answer on get to a million and take home pretty much until about three million per year in revenue um the advice pretty much holds which is one product one avatar on one channel and here's what's hilarious i'll bet you there's a bunch of people on here who have more than one thing going on and they're probably also selling more than one product they're also selling to more than one avatar let's think about this if you could only
(45:21) pick one avatar to sell to and one product to sell them in only one way or one channel to access them how much easier would your life pay how much more quantifiable and simple would that feel does anyone here even thinking about quitting all the side hustles that they're talking about or the half project that they think might become something i'm doing these two kind of businesses i'll see which one works out the answer is either of them will work out but neither of them with an n neither of them will work if you try to do both and so the issue is not even time the issue is detention you only have so
(45:49) much attention you only have so much juju right there's only so much heat uh and you have too many pans on the heat's not concentrated enough and so you got to put the juju on one problem because believe it or not the guy who's crushing you that's what he's doing and so you're trying to compete with two hands tied behind your back against people who are putting every single ounce of their life into just solving one problem if you do that life gets a lot easier and for me i would rather make business easier than harder and so
(46:13) that's kind of the idea is how can we stack the chips in our favor so that it would be unreasonable for us not to be successful if you only had to solve one problem for one avatar and you only had one way that you were going to approach them even if you didn't know how that channel worked even if you weren't perfect to solve in the problem since you only have to do those things you will with enough iteration to solve it and then the marketplace will reward you what are you saying people need to keep in mind when it gets to that one million in take home which almost you know no one gets to even the people that
(46:41) are in freaking eight figure land spending 700k a month on ads what's what's important to keep in mind there are what mistakes do people make when not not making a profitable business the lifetime gross profit per customer has to be higher so to go from three to ten you don't really need to change anything besides making sure the customers are more valuable you can do that by improving the product and just like if you have a recurring based business it's reducing turn most the time and optimizing pricing or adding a single
(47:05) you know high value additional you know service level right um and again you might think well that's adding operational complexity the answer is yes it is adding operational complexity but people who make 10 million are more skilled than people who make three million dollars and so that is a skill that you need to acquire you know in the path of getting there are there exceptions absolutely but these are kind of obviously broad-based for if i'm talking specifically to high-ticket coaches who are in a niche usually going from three to ten million is going to include increasing the lifetime value of the customer in some way either by
(47:36) introducing a back-end or keeping them longer the other piece of it from what you were saying earlier is that if you have to spend that much money on marketing it means the product's not that good last question i have for you alex because it's a big question why did you write the book and what's your new mission if it's not helping gyms be super profitable yeah so right now we're just helping businesses that are doing about five million and up um get to you know 30 50 million dollars a year because now we've done it four times um
(48:01) in the businesses that we own 100 of and so now we're just doing it and participating um in it so we just invest in those companies we basically function as a makeshift exec team so we've got a cfo cool there's me vp sales and so all of those things basically functioning because usually at that five million dollar level the issues you don't have enough talent not enough experience and so we can just go inject those in and then de-bottled like all the things that we know because we've done that so many times and so uh
(48:26) in terms of the marketing perspective i don't really have any desire to sell masterminds coaches or courses because i don't need to you know i mean the businesses that we own already pump out tons of cash flow and i just don't need to do it nor do i really have the desire and so the idea was i'll just make basically my goal is to make the best internet marketing business that exists to make everything and then if they're you know if someone wants to get to that next level they've already proven themselves uh able to execute on the concepts that we
(48:49) gave away for free then it means that they're not gonna need handle holding for me um which means that i've proven that the information works because they executed on it and they've proven to me that they can do it um and so it's kind of it works off of shared uh press right off the bat and so that's that's kind of the goal with the business and the real real is that i think that when i die nothing's going to happen and that there's really no such thing as legacy and if i have 100 generations people forget who i am it makes me feel good
(49:11) i love that i'm like giving you someone up in one minute guys um please share some love to alex uh alex thank you so much he is the man that has nothing to sell you plenty of people broken the world he doesn't want you to be one of them so make sure you check him out and dive deeper into stuff alex appreciate your friendship appreciate your input this has been amazing have a great day dude appreciate you guys thank you for having me

Transcript:
(00:00) they're like man these guys just expect me to sell all day and the answer is yes i wanted to make this because i woke up with this on my mind and i think it was relevant so i was looking through our um our weekly reports and uh i was looking at the sales team stuff and i was looking at uh the glx stuff which is our fulfillment side and uh i thought this was really fascinating i would share this with you so one of the things that happens is we get a lot of people uh who come on and they say you know we're like hey what's your
(00:27) goal right now what are you trying to accomplish right and a lot of gyms are like man if i could get 300 members that would be amazing like 200 members i'd be amazing i'd get 500 members that would be amazing right and so they have these goals right and yet they don't follow the simple math of getting there and so most times the inflow is the cap right now there's obviously like you've probably heard if you've if you've ever followed my stuff for long enough you'd know that i talk a lot about retention about lifetime value
(00:53) etc right but at a basic level there there is at some point what i would consider acceptable metrics right and what that means is let's say that you're uh you know if you're in the service based business you're never going to get your churn below one percent too i mean it's just it's very unlikely right and that's and if you aren't that it's typically because you're growing purely off organic referrals which is awesome but if you want to be massive you need to grow off everything you need to grow off organic you need to grow off
(01:21) outbound you need to grow off a paid acquisition right running ads and um the issue that i just continue to see is and so then so this last week i think we had like 10 gyms um pause on glx since the glx is our kind of done for you side and all 10 of them paused because there was too much inflow they could not handle the lead flow and the appointments uh that were being set for them and i'm gonna pause that right right there and layla was on a podcast this last week as well with uh i think it was push press i think it's push
(01:55) press and uh the ceo push press was like you know um we've we've heard that the number one complaint that that we hear from people you know from our customers who have worked with you is that they're like man these guys just expect me to sell all day and the answer is yes because that's what you said you wanted right and so what's interesting for me is most people want a full gym until they actually have a full gym or see what's required to get a full gym right and so when we used to fly out and force gyms to grow because we didn't have
(02:24) limiting beliefs around growing a gym someone would have 80 clients at their crossfit and then in 21 days they'd have 280 clients at their crossfit and they'd be like holy what do i do i did not sign up for this it's like actually you did sign up for this and so it reminds me oh i'm gonna pull this up for you my favorite my favorite magic cards of all time all right was called burning wish so dr cashy sent me a card versus really cute of him and uh underneath it says she wished for a weapon but for not the skill sorry she wished for a weapon but
(02:58) not for the skill to wield it and i feel like a lot of times that's what happens is uh at least for the the people who are coming in to glx underprepared is they're like i really want to grow i want to get new customers right our top client right now in the last 30 days sign up 100 new 130 new clients all right 130 and we actually that's in the last 30 days but she signed up 130 in the last two and a half weeks so if we give it another like one and a half weeks she'll probably top 200 new clients all right if you want a 200 300 400 500 person
(03:35) facility and you are not able to sign up 20 new clients a week you will not get there right because this is where the acceptable metrics parts comes in i would like to give you permission that if you have a service based business all right services of any kind anything that is easy in is easy out and you're like well i mean we have to onboard them and which you should be right but easy in service is easy in switching from your crm to another crm not easy right big pain in the ass and so the likely that you switch is very
(04:10) very low which is why software and things like that are much stickier than services are and so you have to kind of accept that that comes with the territory so if you're selling service and you want to be big then you have to know that there's going to be a back end churn that's going to occur and that's just because easy and easy out that's how it works right but if you have easy in and you're not maximizing the fact that that's your advantage and services that you can scale quickly right your inflow then you're not using one of the primary
(04:40) advantages of being a service provider right and so if it's like i want to get to to 200 or let's say let's say let's say 300 members right i want to get to 300 members okay cool you want to get to 300 members now your turn's 10 industry average and you can only sign up 10 trials a week and that's you maxed out right 10 new prospects per week that give you a credit card for some front-end program or a trial of some sort right you can only sign up 10 of those a week now even somebody who comes in and signs up straight into eft what we have noticed
(05:14) is we still have to resell them on a longer term because really there's the i'm going to try it phase and then there's the i'm going to commit phase and even if like i said you sign someone up for recurring it doesn't actually mean they'll stick until they really make the second sale and we've seen that across the board for us and our gyms at least okay so if you can only take on 10 new new potential prospects right per week and that's your cap and you want to get to 300 members then that would mean that you have to convert 75 percent of them
(05:42) week in week out and a lot of people are not doing that and 10 mind you means that you're closing 50 of four calls a day right that are showing and let's say you're getting half those calls which means you have to have eight scheduled appointments a day now most gyms that i talk to don't even have they're they're stressed out of their mind with that right but that's just for them to get 20 or 30 new customers a month you want to get to 500 you want to get to 400 you have to accept the fact that you're going to be selling all day
(06:14) because you're selling a service and you're trying to get to a high number and so most times most times people have goals and are disconnected from the actions that are required to get there right the numbers the basic math and most people just don't do the math like so i would highly encourage you if you know what your turn is look backwards and think okay if i'm going to lose 20 customers a month and i'm at 200 and i want to get to 400 a lot of times you don't just double your inflow like sometimes you have to do even more than that because
(06:44) you also lose some efficiency on the back it's part of the game right and so if you're at 10 you're losing 20 all right and so if you know you're converting half of your trials that means you have to make 40 sales a month all right the industry average by the way is 35 which would mean that if you wanted to replace those 20 you'd have to sell 60 trials a month okay of some sort 60 front-end programs of some sort per month if you can't do that you will never grow and you will always wonder why all right and so this message is
(07:14) basically for anyone who wants to be a big dog if you want to dominate the market which is the marketing that most people respond to like dominate your competition blah blah blah all that kind of stuff right you want to be a seven-figure gym okay cool then you have to do the math that seven-figure gyms do and i do not know a single one of them that do not know how to take on high numbers of traffic on a weekend week out basis right what i continue to see is i'm gonna turn my ads on for a couple weeks and i'll turn them off and then we
(07:45) gotta go service those people no no no no if you want to scale your inflow never stops you have to be able to sign up people this week and next week and the week after that and the week after that and fulfill you need to be doing both things concurrently and if you're incapable of doing that it means you're not able to manage your schedule of your team right they have to know that the first two hours of the day it's blocked on their time is going for outbound uh for for ongoing fulfillment like they're reaching out to your existing customers
(08:13) to make sure that they stay then you have two hours a day that's blocked for onboarding for new customers then you have orientations right all that stuff and then you have sales and you have to disperse the meetings that have to happen in order to make this entire model work right and that's with any service business like this works the same for us right we've got sales appointments we have kickoff calls we have builds that happen in the background and then we have ongoing check-ins to make sure the clients are
(08:38) doing well right beyond that we still have daily calls with me to make sure that they're uh being able to sell and convert and all that kind of stuff right and so the whole point of this is if you're not where you want to be a lot of time it's because your inflow is your bottleneck and you haven't operationally prepared yourself for what it actually looks like to sign up a hundred people in a month right 50 60 80 new people in a month the math is there if you want to do it you can do it but i'm just seeing this like more times
(09:08) than not and then and like when when dan said it for push press that the no more complaint that people got from jim launches like they're just they just flood you know they flooded me with lee they expected me to sell a date yeah because that's what you said you wanted so either switch your goal or switch your head right like because like if you want to get to here it's just math backwards right and so just most people have not done that math so here's how you do the math if you want to grow to let's say uh 300 members okay and let's
(09:42) say your churn is 10 that means you need to sign up 30 people per month to break even now let's just get those 30 done let's say you convert half because to get the 300 you have some skills right so you're converting half your front end people which means you're at 60 new signups per month that's 15 a week all right now if you're selling one out of two that you're that you're talking to now you're talking 120 a month uh of people who you're talking to ever so that's 30 a week roughly right that you're talking to and you're
(10:13) probably selling only five days or now here's another one i could go off on it's like we only sold two days a week it's like well good luck trying to sell 100 you know 30 people in two days it's not it's very unlikely that it's going to happen right so if you're not let's say you're selling six days and you're selling 30.
(10:27) so you gotta sell five people a day or so meet with five people per day which is not that unreasonable it's five 30-minute sessions it's two and a half hours three hours of sales a day like this is not crazy right um now you're still gonna have show ups right which is gonna be another inefficiency all right so to go 30 goes to 60 appointments a week oh interesting all right now we're at 60 appointments a week and we're just maintaining 300 we're not even growing to get there yet interesting right and so now we're
(10:57) seeing how this math starts to work out you're like okay so now if i wanted to grow an extra 30 on top of that then i need to have even more i've need to double what i just said okay and so we have 30 conversions from 60 front and sales which is half of 120 meetups 120 uh client conversations per month okay that and then you have half of those that show for their appointments and then you need to double that to grow right that's the math and so if you're not able to deal with that math then you will not get there
(11:35) and sometimes it's just like just giving the sheer reality of the situation is like it's a volume game it's a math game it's the same people who get bent out of shape over one person who says i gotta talk to my husband i don't have my card on me it's like cool move on champions have short memories right they bounce back fast they're unaffected by losses because they're just thinking i know i need to close half which means here's the news flash if you have to meet with 200 people a hundred people are gonna say no
(12:06) and you have to be emotionally okay with that because you just understand the numbers right you know like i don't know i mean you should try and get better at your craft always of course right but if you just can't accept emotionally and this is what i continue to see is that some guys just can't take the emotional beating of having people say no which is why they'll never grow right and like the most experienced sales people they don't get bothered they're like yeah they understand that people come with their own preconceived notions to the
(12:33) call it's not about you the salesman it's about them right and just remembering it's about them so don't get butt hurt if for some reason someone says no of course they have excuses that's why they're not in shape of course they have limiting beliefs that's why they're not in shape and so if we're going to expect that they're not going to come with emotional baggage to the call or to the meeting it's ridiculous right and so then if we're to take this back one step right and we said let's say 240 uh consoles we
(13:01) we're gonna have to be generating 15 leads a day right roughly huh well what does it take to get 15 leads a day in cost well right let's back into it 15 leads a day 10 bucks a lead or 150 a day it's 4 500 an ad spend per month just the math and i think that a lot of people don't confront them at they make these goals and don't think about what it takes to get there and then as soon as it even gets to a third of what it would actually take to get there to achieve what they want they're like oh my god this is just so much so well yeah if
(13:34) that's what you want then this is how this is how it works it's like well i want to be a champion bodybuilder okay well i can only work out three days a week for an hour okay good luck okay right and so it's like do you want to be a champion or do you just want to be another person who also ran and that's fine if that's what you want it's just i'm not hearing that that's what you want so either people need to get real clear on what they really want or re and and and then make the adjustments accordingly or realize that
(14:05) it's not actually their priority and that could go into a whole other thing about like priorities are just priorities there's never really conflicting priorities you just have one that is a bigger priority than another and if it conflicts then the other one is a secondary priority and sometimes priorities do conflict in terms of their nature but not their importance and so you just need to figure out which of these things is more important to me right and most times it's simply being able to delegate time and appropriate on
(14:30) a calendar when things need to get done if we know that we have to onboard 30 new customers per week then how do we fit let's say 30 30 minute consultations in okay that's 15 hours a week i've got one team member they're here five days a week there's three hours on their on their calendar great so now that one person has three hours a day on their calendar five days a week for taking on new customers okay that seems reasonable they still have another five hours right and if they have to do conversion meetings
(15:00) which is to convert them into a long-term membership from a trial or a front-end program now uh from from those people we know that we again have 30 people we got to meet with and so of those 30 people and it's to say it's going to take a 30 it's a 30 minute console to sell someone into membership boom now that person's at six hours a day all right this is just one employee and so this one employee is now managing the onboarding and the conversion sales right and then they have two hours a day to do continuous reach outs to the
(15:28) existing customers great that is a role right and then you have a sales person who's gonna what i mean that has to be a full-time sales person who's gonna hit those numbers right they're gonna meet with 60 people right 60 people six days a week it's 10 a day right 30 minutes it's only five hours right and so if you're looking at this this is the game is how long does it take how many of them do we have block the time and that is how you scale that's it that's all there is right and just and just confronting the math now you can
(15:59) try and tweak it and control it but you have to understand you're not going to have orders of magnitude improvements you're not going to sell 100 of people who show up you're not going to keep 100 of people a month over a month it just doesn't happen right it just it just doesn't and so you have to you deal with what is right you're always gonna try to improve and that's normal but if you wait for always your improvements you will never start and you will never get to where you're trying to go and so that is my message for the week is that um
(16:25) your inflow is probably your bottleneck and there has to be acceptable metrics that you can extrapolate off of and then work backwards into how much time that's required and how many people are required to help you get there and if that means for you as the proprietor or the owner of the business that you need to work double time in order to afford the person who's going to be able to release the bottleneck then that is part of the game all right so anyways i hope you guys have an amazing monday i hope you look at money math and i think you
(16:48) look at time math to figure out how you can break your bottlenecks so you can get to the gym that you want whether that's corona or not corona or remote or launching anything or you have a b2b business it doesn't matter the metrics are all the same all right so lots of love hope you guys are stoked uh for this week because i am we're super excited and i will catch you guys all soon all right [Music] you

4 Perspective Shifts That Keep Me Going - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) in march of 2019 my wife and i were walking together after just having finished a 4.4 million dollar month and she turned to me and she said alex let's just shut it all down she's like i'm so tired of this i'm so burnt out i just don't want to do this anymore and it was at that moment that i realized that in order to progress in the entrepreneurial game we had to change the way we operated the way we thought and so if you're an entrepreneur or you're a business owner the number one thing that i've seen that creates success is longevity meaning
(00:33) that you can continue to play the game because at the end of the day none of us is going to quit business or hopefully not quit business and so in order to decrease the likelihood that we quit which is the only way to fail we have to think through our problems with a defined framework and so rather than focus on the actual framework of the decision making what i want to do is focus in around the state in which you can manage your own thoughts right and so um i've had to deal with plenty of stressors as you can imagine
(01:00) so if you're stressed in your own business right now like you know add a zero to whatever your revenue is and you'll have ten times the potential for stress if you're ten times bigger or a hundred times the stress if you're 100 times bigger which depends on who's listening we may be that for you and so i can tell you truthfully that the way that i've been able to eliminate pressure which has created longevity in the game for me has been through four strategies that actually work in the real world for me so the first that i do whenever i have
(01:27) any kind of negative situation is i go a thousand x negative all right and then i re-evaluate so let me explain what that means so if for example there's something that's bad that happens we get a bad review or we get you know a client's upset or i have an employee who says something bad to another employer or employee that's key leaves or someone tries to you know a competitor steal stuff and then starts back whatever it is right there's a million problems in go business or you have cash flow issues or where you can't make payroll whatever it
(01:55) is right i like to think of this one as my first this is my like my first line of defense the first thing i think about is if this were to happen a thousand times more right and this works really well with what i would consider like minor to medium-sized grievances so things that happen that are kind of everyday business that can you know bother you for a day or two days or a week right well if you can just shorten that loop of that cycle of you being disturbed because the thing is lots of those things are going to happen
(02:22) every single week a lot of times you just don't know about them right depending on the size of your business and so i just happen to know about it now and so first off i like to think about that but second is i'll do this right which is i'll imagine that every day in my life this happens whatever that thing is right uh customer's upset now obviously if it's a core issue you have to resolve it but in terms of like it happening in my affective or my emotional reaction to it then i think to myself well if this happened every single day and this
(02:50) happened every hour of every day at some point i would become desensitized to it right because i had so much stimulus of this i would not be able to have an emotional response and so when i think and i imagine myself experiencing this negative thing over and over and over and over again it's called negative visualization then what ends up happening is i become immune to it and so i think to myself well if i can become immune to it after a thousand tries i can become immune to it on the first try because it means nothing has
(03:13) actually changed to only my perspective on the occurrence and in so doing you can short wire yourself to that end outcome and then fast forward it to the present so you can live the rest of your day or less of your week without being emotionally disturbed and when you do that at least for me i feel like i make better decisions and so i think for most of us as entrepreneurs and business owners we are judged by the marketplace by the quality of our decisions that's ultimately what it is right it's just how good are the quality of the decisions that we
(03:37) make and so if i can decrease the likelihood that i make bad decisions and i can do it on a regular basis then this is something that protects my mind and candidly it's what makes life worth living the second thing that i'll do is that when i'm preparing for something that that i need to start doing right because there might be habits or things that you need to start doing you know this is a this is a slightly different example but it's i'm giving you the four different strategies that have worked really well
(04:02) for me the second one is let's say you wanted to start working out because you're like you know what i've been neglecting my health or you know start eating healthy whatever it is right those are fitness examples but just go with me what i will do is i will expect the worst circumstance all right so rather than saying okay i'm going to go work out and feel excited right to go work out i'm super pumped what i want to do is i want to plan and prepare my mental state for when it times to work out when it comes time to work out i'm going to be
(04:30) exhausted i'm not going to have slept well i'm going to have a lot of business stress and so i have to expect that going into every workout now if i don't have that happen then it's a bonus rather than expecting nothing to be my my mental state and then when something bad does happen then i have this reason right and so it it literally does go into truly expecting the worst case scenario and making the pre-formed decision to act anyways despite that because you have planned for it so most people most humans have really
(05:01) good psychological resilience if we brace for it so if you're about to give someone bad news for example you actually have to let them hey this is bad news hey you might want to sit down for this because people actually are very resilient if you give them a moment to emotionally brace themselves and so what we're doing here is using this bracing technique on ourselves in advance of a situation that is likely to occur at some time between now and when we die especially if it's a habit that has to be ongoing right and so what i do is i emotionally
(05:25) brace for the worst scenario all right that's number two the third thing that i do and this is probably the one that i use the most it's really the one that i use the most actually i'll i'll say that one for last a a different version of this the emotional brace is an extreme version right so kind of this is imagine the thing that you just said happen that bothered you for a thousand times then it stops affecting you the second one is you emotionally brace yourself the third one is you imagine worst case all right now
(06:00) the point here is kind of like a pain anchor okay and so what i mean by a pain anchor is it gives you perspective on your current issues right so for this for example whenever you've had a family member die or someone close to you die or some of you even have a pet diet depends on where you're at in your life right if you have something that was painful for you right all of us benefit we get the gift of perspective from those who die that's like the one of the final gifts that any death occurs that's in your proximity will give you right
(06:28) and so for me i think about that negative situation i really like trying and soak myself in it right really try and like put it on and walk around and what that painful state would be whatever whatever worst case scenario i could imagine might be death of a spouse it might be death of a of a parent whatever right or a child something horrific right but if i can truly allow myself to go there then what happens is i get so much context and perspective on the little thing like somebody bashing a piece of content or someone
(06:59) saying that they hate your ad or whatever it might be the thing that is deriding you and all of a sudden that problem becomes massively minimized right it becomes almost inconsequential and what i found is that over my life in the business there are so many there's an infinite amount of problems truly like there's an unlimited amount of problems i could think of so many things we should be doing or we could be doing better or should not have happened right but it's only because we put the word should in front of it that we have an
(07:25) expectation that is different than reality which creates the the friction in our minds creates the dissonance it creates the unhappiness that we have and so if i can imagine the worst case scenario and then actively minimize my current situation then i usually can get right through it and most times what i what i found is that most problems shrink into a relevance within broader context they actually never get solved we just realize that we just don't care and that they are no longer meaningful to us and so that has been something
(07:54) that's been very useful for me as we've grown because frankly the bigger your company gets the more ability and potential you have to become stressed and i think most of us are here for freedom and so if you want freedom then you have to at least for me i have found that i have to manage my mental state in order to continue to make high quality decisions and so that leaves me the last one which is probably my my favorite and most used one that i use on on anything and this may this may bother some of you and that's
(08:18) okay this is an n sorry universe is that this is a this is a world view that i have so if you are if you are you know don't don't be trigger you know don't don't take offense to this but i'm telling you what has worked for me and so i believe that the universe will continue to expand until eventually everything becomes a fine mist over a long enough time horizon the sun will give out all stars will extinguish and then everything will just become a fine mist and as silly as that may sound it means that anything that we do this video anything
(08:52) that i accomplish in this world will eventually disappear and be meaningless and so some people find that incredibly depressing i don't i find that to be incredibly meaningful because it means to me that i'm allowed to i am the only person that ascribes meaning to anything because it means that nothing has inherent meaning and so that means that when i have any stressors in my life i'm saying that i'm choosing my brain is choosing to make meaning out of this when there was no meaning to be made to begin with and so by doing that i can
(09:24) play the notes of the piano of meaning that happen across the occurrences and circumstances in my life and so when i think about it in this context everything shrinks into a relevance and so a lot of the the concepts around like i want to build a legacy i want i want to make an impact i want to leave a dent in the universe you're not you're probably not going to leave it done in the universe and even if you made some big advancement within 500 years like it'll probably be forgotten and that would be like if you're the top
(09:51) point zero zero zero zero one percent right it's unlikely but it is a hundred percent likely that over a long enough time horizon everything will disappear right and by doing that for me it decreases the pressure that i put on myself for having to i must i should i have to like i can't live without those thoughts that strangle me right those are the things that destroy my ability to make decisions because i become way more emotional as a result of them and so whenever i have any kind of negative occurrence or any stressors
(10:22) that come up in my life which are inevitable i use this as my ultimate frame of reference this is my ultimate trump card that i use to keep my my emotions at bay and ultimately say i am the master of my own universe i get to decide what has meaning and for me i'll tell you what what what i have found most meaningful for me is that my purpose in life to to my knowledge at this point is to learn i love learning and so that is that is why i make these videos because i feel like i am able to better learn how to think i'm better on
(10:58) how to run businesses i'm a better learn i can better learn all of the aspects of everything by teaching it right and i'm sure if you ever did a book report when you were in high school you learned the one chapter you had to do your book report on or give a presentation on way better than any of the other chapters because when you have to teach something you have to learn it better you have to learn the nuances of what makes something work and so for me even cataloging these things been useful for me because i
(11:19) think these are all the things that i do huh but now i have a process that i can continually use use haphazardly just because i've just trained myself over time doing this and so i don't know where you're at in your business career if you're you know you're at seven figures you're at eight figures or multi-figures you have multiple companies whatever it is right this has been so personally impactful for me that it has helped me be in this for the long haul because if nothing has meaning except for what i choose to give meaning then it means i
(11:48) can choose to only play games that i find meaningful and by extension i will not fall out of the game or quit because the thing that i'm doing is the thing that that i derive the most meaning from and so i will be able to outlast longer players pursuit and what happened is for me my life becomes a glorification to an idea faster and break through the bottlenecks that you have so you can so for me like this i will you know we'll do every time i can check out one of my uh my next videos that are coming out as i'm going through courses the lessons
(12:22) that i have more engaging more entertaining more educational have more stories woven into them so that hopefully i can transfer these things to someone else because that is what i find meaningful not because it is eternally meaningful but just because that ideal to me has meaning and so um that is something that i believe is eternal values are eternal values in the universe and so for me i choose to dedicate my content to those ideals and so anyways i hope you find value in this i hope this is interesting to you subscribe like all
(12:52) that jazz um and have an absolutely wonderful day where you can create all the meaning you want or remove all the meaning from the negative things that occur in your life using some of these four hacks so lots of love keeping awesome and i'll catch you in the next vid bye

Transcript:
(00:00) as you build your wealth there are people who you will need to help you and have in your arsenal that means lawyers accountants investment professionals uh people who you uh invest with so those are different things people you do deals with people you do business with people you might get mentorship from and selecting the right people can make or break your life and the trajectory of your business i can tell you that firsthand i would not be where i am today if i didn't have the mentors and advisors and counsel that i've received
(00:35) over the years and over time one of the hardest things is trying to figure out who you're going to trust and what's the process that you have to go through in order to find those people and so having done this for a you know a while and we've you know moved a lot of money uh in our businesses and for those who don't know me my name is alex for mozzie i own a portfolio of companies that does about 85 million a year the whole goal for this channel is to document our journey from uh 85 million a year to a billion
(00:59) dollars a year in revenue in our portfolio and just share the lessons that we've learned along the way and so i've boiled this down to two things two traits uh that you can look for so i try to make this as simple as possible and i don't just do this review i do it for me because i think you know we're kind of in this together and this crazy thing we call life anyway so the two things that i look for and then i'll show you the tests that i think through for each of them so the first is integrity and i know that might sound silly but when you
(01:23) like think about it you need someone who you can trust like if you're giving someone your money like or you're trying to take someone's advice or counsel you need to trust their intentions all right and so it's not just whether they have integrity it's whether they have your best interest in mind all right so i'm gonna get to how i solve for that in a second but that is the first character trait of you need that you need of a council of somebody of any kind of council really whether it's investment law et cetera
(01:47) the second is efficacy or their skill set right so let's think of both let's think of just different scenarios here so let's say you might trust your mom implicitly but she doesn't have the skill of knowing much about you know how to structure insurance policies or trusts or you know investments in tech startups right she might not have that skill but you might trust her intention right for you specifically on the reverse of that you might see that there's this person who's got lots of skill is prodigious in this
(02:13) but it also means that they know exactly how to screw you if they want to right which is one of the double-sided things of being really good at something right you know all the details you know how to write the agreement structure the deals in order to make sure that you you know get the best outcome right and so the idea is to find someone who has both your best interests at heart and has the ability to deliver on what you want right and so it's both of these things since you're like well yeah maybe that seems obvious for me just
(02:40) even boiling it down to that was very helpful for me because when i look and i look through advisors look for people i want to get counsel from i have to look at these two things all right so here's how i test for the integrity piece and here's how you can kind of like you can control for risk here right one is i always try and interview as many advisors as humanly possible all right and i do that because i'm going to get as much information from each of the council during this process that will give me perspective from which to make a
(03:04) judgment right one of the biggest problems with this like if you think about julie who's trying to lose weight right she goes in the gym and then she talks to 10 personal trainers one personal trainer says it's all about high fat low carb another guy says hey don't worry about that keto stuff it's all about high carb low fat and then another guy says no you really just need a balanced thing and another guy says it's only about calories it's only about counting your macros and so you get this huge perspective so that hopefully you
(03:24) can make a judgment call otherwise when you talk to the first guy and he says it's all about keto then you're like well i guess this is it right i guess these guys all have opinions when in reality there is a truth you just don't have the perspective in which to make a judgment yet and so the first step in this is that i interview as many as as i possibly can from reputable sources so this is where i reach out to my network i make posts et cetera to try and get as many referrals as i can all right so that's step one step two for the
(03:46) integrity piece is that i try and have a line incentives now a lot of times they're incentive systems that appear aligned but not are not in reality so let me give you an example so in the real estate market if you're a realtor for example you may think oh this realtor has my best interest at heart right because they have an incentive to sell the house and so that is why they're going to get compensated so they want to sell it for as much as possible ah but they aren't incentivized to sell it for as much as possible they're
(04:10) incentivized to sell as fast as possible and get a deal closed right and so think about this for you selling a house for five hundred thousand dollars that's worth five hundred thousand dollars is a normal you know that like that's normal that's the market price right but for you to make an extra let's say twenty five thousand or fifty thousand dollars would be really material that would be a huge extra outcome for you you would probably push a lot harder to get the extra 25 or 50 000 now let's say that um you could probably
(04:35) sell it in a day at 450 000 because it's below the market value of the house right now here's what's crazy is that if a a selling realtor you know like total might be seven percent two percent goes to the buyer and five percent goes to the seller if five percent is going to your realtor five percent of five hundred thousand dollars right is 25 grand okay and so for them the the 50 000 decrease to drop you from 500 to 450 means that they're going to give up 2500 so they're going to make 22 500 so let me ask you a question now the
(05:07) reverse if they sell for 525 they're going to get 27 500 right and so it's a 5 000 swing off of a you know 25 000 nut for them and one of them might take them three months and one of them might take them a day so what is their incentive their incentive is to get is to make as much money as possible per unit of time and so they're incentivized to sell as fast as possible and so this is one of those things where you have to put your thinking cap on and say are our incentives truly aligned and so when we're looking at this when i say there's
(05:36) two aspects that i look for counselor or somebody who's going to help me do something financially legally insurance wise whatever it is so first is that integrity piece and are there incentives aligned the incentives being aligned and you could restructure that deal and say hey you know what you're going to get zero percent on anything below 400 000 i'll give you three percent on anything between 400 and 450 and then from 450 and up i'll give you 20 right or 15 or whatever right and so now they're highly incentivized to push and
(06:03) now your incentives are aligned because each increment for you is worth almost as much it is to them and that is how you would align incentives all right now how do you test for the second thing which is their skill set this one's hard all right especially if you don't have the perspective from which to make a judgment which when i answer new things when i'm trying to learn about trust and i'm trying to learn about investment things and different vehicles i'm learning about storage units more about multi like
(06:23) you're like man there's so much stuff there's so much nuance that you have to have right and so the first thing is i like to usually read two to three books on the topic all right and i read two to three books just so i don't appear like an idiot um and so i can at least understand what they're saying and they're going to respect you to they will it's kind of like defense if you bring your if you bring at least some level of knowledge they don't feel like they're going to take advantage of you so this is this is the first thing that
(06:44) i do and this is because i don't like feeling exposed in these types of conversations the second thing you can do is if you have someone that you can trust you can bring them in alongside you and the third thing that you can do which is probably the the most and highest recommended is repeating the same action i said in the first hand which is try talking to as many of them as possible and then you will gather the insights and you'll see the people who demonstrate the most expertise and what you can do is take what one person says
(07:08) and say well what about this and see what they reply with right and as you gain more and more knowledge and this is how you so in the consulting world this is qualitative research right this is where you're literally doing interviews essentially to gather information so that you can make an informed decision right and so when you do these interviews and this is what this is the lazy part this is what most people don't do is they won't do this work right they won't take the time to interview 20 people or 10 people when in reality
(07:34) these one decisions the guy who you decide to you know invest in in their fund or if you decide to buy this building or invest in a fund that that buys x y z right or you or you have somebody who who manages your portfolio whatever it is right that one decision can be one of the most if not the biggest influence on your total net worth over a long period of time and people take more time to figure out what they want to where they want to go on vacation than where they're going to put their money right and so my ask to you
(07:59) is that if you if you put these put these lenses on think about both of these lenses lens one do i think this person is integris do i think this person has my best interest at heart and then two do they have the skill to deliver on that promise because i don't want my mom doing my investments i know she has my best at heart but she has no idea what she's doing and then i don't want somebody who absolutely knows what they're doing and does not have my best interests at heart right which honestly unfortunately is a lot more of the cases
(08:24) that you'll come up with and candidly you know a lot of times they're literally incentivized against you you know uh in in the insurance industry they're they're kind of incentivized to rip you off it's it's it's pretty terrible and there's a lot of industries like that mortgage brokers are incentivized to rip you off and so you really have to look at it from both lenses and these types of decisions can make the biggest impact on your net worth in your financial future simply based on who you decide to work with and
(08:47) so that is the framework that i think through when i'm looking at looking for council looking for trusted advisors final note that i'll leave you with i was watching a video of warren buffett and he talked about how uh his life in most people's life is more or less the same he's like i eat at the same fast food restaurants i get the same desserts of dairy queen i wear the same suits as you do except you know he's like at least they look cheap on me he said but one thing that he he realized that was different about him is that um he
(09:12) defines a successful life based on the number of people who truly love you when you die and he gave a definition of that that i thought was really powerful and so one of his friends i can't remember the name he said survived auschwitz and he said that her judge of character of who was a true friend and who truly loved her was would this person hide me if the nazis were coming and that's been such a powerful frame for me to think through which is it's not just you know will this person trying to help me lots of people try and help other people but
(09:41) how many people help other people when their own lives are at risk just for helping because it's doing the right thing and so i think when when i think about that type of frame the number of people i have in my life that meet that characteristic are far and few between and i think that if you can if you can trust the people that you do business with to that degree you will be best served and if i have to choose between the two i would rather have somebody who i trust their intention and i have eight an eight out of ten on the efficacy than
(10:04) somebody who whose intentions i am unsure of and they have a ten on ten of the efficacy so anyways lots of love hope you enjoyed this uh click subscribe if you did uh and i'll see you guys next video keep being awesome bye

I spent $2,000,000 and it didn't make me happy.. - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) i gave away two million dollars personally uh donated to uh after-school all-stars in the form of cash and uh and actual physical products we gave 250 000 bands uh like workout bands uh like digital ones you know what i mean like fit fit fitbits 250 000 kind of fitbits to uh to kids in underprivileged city so we could encourage them to get fit and healthy and we donated 1.
(00:27) 2 million to to fund the staffing and i can truthfully tell you that when i did that i did it because i wanted to feel better and i can tell you now that it didn't actually make me feel that much better i share that because i don't know how many people would say that um and i just want to keep this keep this channel 100 real i think a lot of times at least for me like i want to do things because i want to find meaning and um i had a really really interesting conversation and so the other day i had a four-hour conversation uh with what
(00:56) i'll say a friend of mine but i consider him a friend hopefully he considers me a friend dr john berardi and he sold his company of the majority stake in his company for over nine figures and he doesn't do anything right now actively i've had two unbelievable conversations with john and i'm always very grateful for my time with him there were two statements that he made through that four hours that have stuck with me um since then and one from the former conversation that i had with him that really kind of changed my my life and my
(01:22) outlook and from the first conversation what he talked about was how he said you need to look at things and consume content for people who are outside of the matrix and i was like what do you mean by that he was like everyone's inside of the matrix everyone is trying to make money right everyone's trying to make money they're operating from a place of scarcity they're operating from a place of desire of wanting something more than what they currently have and whenever they're doing that they're like they're operating from a different energy level
(01:53) and i don't think he used that exact word but that's that's kind of how i perceived it and that was like my big takeaway from the first one and i think that between my first conversation my second was about six or nine months i'm feeling this kind of shift that's happening within us you know laila and i as we as we start this channel and uh you know we write the book which you guys if you haven't heard of it's 100 million offers uh it's got a lot of good reviews it's 99 cents i made it 99 cents because i want everyone to be able to
(02:17) afford it that's as cheap as jeffy b will let me do it and anyway so i had this conversation with john and the first question i asked him when i shifted the conversation to kind of personal stuff i said now that you you know you've made what you have you made your exit i was like you know how how do you create and destroy meaning he was like huh that's an interesting question and i was like like in work like how do you create and destroy meaning in the things that you work on and he paused and he looked at me and i
(02:43) felt like he was staring into my soul and he was like why do you think work needs to be meaningful i was like ah okay and this is why i love talking to people who who are who are outside of the matrix right there's so much perspective and later in the conversation i was like well then outside of work you know like how do you gain meaning and he's like why do you think work why do you think life needs to be meaningful and he's like just hold for a second so if you say that life has to be meaningful then what happens is you
(03:10) create this desire right that life must be a certain way which means we're not accepting life as it currently is and as soon as we say that life has to be a certain way it must be meaningful then we create this deficit this deficiency between where we are and where we want to be and so in so doing we create the deficiency that we're trying to avoid by saying it must be a certain way and i was like ah god and so it just made me realize a lot of the you know in the in the in the book i think my first book jim loan secrets
(03:36) which is a gym book for transparency this book is for all businesses uh but my first book was the gym book and uh i think the opening passage uh says it's from orson scott card we question all of our beliefs except for those that we truly believe and those who never think to question it all and i always take that to heart because the beliefs that we truly hold dear are the ones that we don't e they operate in the background of our minds their assumptions that we make on how the world is and how it's supposed to be how it must be how it
(04:03) should be right what we have to do right i'm like i must create meaning i should work should be meaningful but by creating that i end up creating an equation of deficiency which then ends up making or forcing myself to not experience that right and so i'll tell you a quick story so when i was in college i dated a girl who was really really obsessed with happiness and she might be completely over this chapter in her life i'm sure she is but at the time she was really into happiness and positive psychology she even majored in
(04:35) psychology so everything was always like does this make me happy does this make me happy does this make me happy right so it's like we're studying for a thing he's like does this make me happy and so for me i ended up actually getting really sick of that concept because i felt like i was always analyzing and being like no like this doesn't make me happy right i got so frustrated with it i got so in my head about like happiness happiness happiness that i remember that i gave myself the mantra [ __ ] happiness and so as soon as i
(05:02) said this is how i'm going to live i was like [ __ ] happiness i'm just going to get [ __ ] done and i'm going to move forward i feel like i ended up actually experiencing more joy in the work that i was doing i didn't realize this but as as we kind of reached another quote mountaintop or whatever you want to call it as we've kind of succeeded in business and whatnot we i created another happiness uh placeholder right which i now called meaning or fulfillment right by doing that i created yet another equation of
(05:30) deficiency in my own life which is always analyzing my work and saying is this meaningful do i get fulfillment from this and all of that kind of jazz but for me what ends up happening is like if i go donate all this money and i feel nothing i feel like i failed right and and then the question is like when you donate are you do should you feel better i assumed that i was supposed to feel better right feel good but i didn't this has been kind of the the thing that i am doing right now or at least is what i'm thinking through so i'm sharing this
(05:59) with the channel it has been i use the word it's been meaningful for me to uh give myself the excuse or give myself permission rather to not find meaning in things and that has been unbelievably freeing which is just giving myself permission to work on things that i may or may not find meaningful but to simply do the thing and i i think that for me giving myself permission to not find meaning has allowed me to accept reality as it currently is and by accepting it as it currently ends is i have i do not have a deficiency that i must resolve between
(06:38) where i am and where i think it should be and by doing that i have um i've you know i've just i've enjoyed the process more so i'll put it that way i have less uh less anxiety around those things not to see that anxiety is bad it is a human condition or part of the human condition um but it has been something that i have experienced by by first saying [ __ ] happiness earlier in my life and then creating meaning as the new happiness thing that i should be striving for and again i think now it's removing meaning or destroying the idea
(07:08) that something should be meaningful should not be meaningful that has been very very valuable for me simply focusing on the work at hand and doing it well according to my values which is whether this is meaningful or not the way that i choose to live is according to these values and is the way that i am completing this work is the way that i am showing up on this meeting is the way that i am conducting myself is the way that i'm making this decision in alignment with those values and in thinking like that i feel like i'm able
(07:38) to do it in the present rather than in the future i'm able to walk with the values that i choose rather than try and pursue meaning in and of itself which created a deficit between where i was where i wanted to go which created a negative experience again not that negative experience are bad but i have a preference of not having them if i can avoid them i show you this i know this is a little bit more heady than more more of my my natural stuff talking about money but um i guess i make this because i know a lot of entrepreneurs are like me hopefully
(08:11) maybe not not hopefully like me but hopefully they're just like themselves but if you were like me in that you strive for these things i can tell you that i got no more meaning from giving lots of money away um at all taking the actions that i am taking with the intention of being aligning of being in alignment with the values that i find meaningful has been the thing that has been truly freeing for me mentally and i make this channel because it feels in alignment with my values i wrote the book um and the books because they're in
(08:46) alignment with my values you know building acquisition.com and and taking interest in the companies that we do in our portfolio has been in alignment with the values rather than saying is this company meaningful is my work with this company meaningful because here's the one that really gets me tricked up and this is also something that john brought up which is like admitting that and again this may be contrary to a lot of people's religious beliefs i don't mean to offend anyone that is not my intention here but my
(09:11) belief my viewpoint of the world is that when we die nothing happens and when you and legacy is a myth and so when the idea of taking money and then having my kids right then have something i think that ruins people i think wealth without the skill of acquiring the wealth is uh like my favorite magic card of all time might take the gathering um there's a card called burning wish the flavor text on the card is she wished for a weapon but for not the skill to wield it and i always thought that was so profound because
(09:43) when you give i feel like money is power right it's just raw energy that you can either you know you create hospitals you can build bombs with it whatever you want you can do it with money but if you don't have the skill of learning how to master and wield money which is in which is really just learning how to get it to flow to you if you don't have that skill that those traits right if you get it it's like having all this raw power and i think it ruins people and so i already knew layla and i already decided and we just signed our
(10:08) will this is probably why this is top of mind for me we signed our wills a few days ago and when we did that i realized that we don't have kids and everything that i've amassed and what's probably going to become a pretty big fortune when we die i'm just donating anyways because i believe that even if i did have kids one i wouldn't give it to him and if i did choose to give it to him here's how i think how crazy this is from a legacy standpoint a hundred generations from now you're diluting your gene pool you
(10:36) know 100 multiplied like factored right and so it's like you know cutting by half cutting by half cutting by half cutting by half times 100 right and that's assuming that humans are still around 100 generations from now but if they were i'm still not even any way related to these people and i kind of ruin them anyways because i'm giving them wealth that they don't control and don't understand how it was generated right and they definitely don't remember who i was not that that's that i need that but like just being real and the
(11:02) other alternative is that in 100 generations there won't be any humans right and in that case then the legacy doesn't matter either and so that was what was kind of like my ultimate wraparound with this of meaning is that nothing inherently has meaning which als also gives us the power to create and destroy meaning as we see fit but more importantly to rise above meaning and say why am i saying that things should or should not be meaningful and answering and examining that question has been very valuable for me as an entrepreneur
(11:30) because in some ways it's freed up a lot of my attention because of this continued obsession i had or that i have tendencies towards towards only doing things that are meaningful when in fact i feel like my an easier thing that has been useful for me has been am i doing things that are in alignment with my values and those values to me are meaningful in and of themselves and that is all and they don't have to be that way they shouldn't be that way but for me doing actions in that way rather than putting it and casting it in the
(11:58) future has been a useful mental exercise and so um i don't know where you're at in your journey uh but my name is alex ramosey we've got a portfolio of companies that do about 85 million a year my goal with acquisition.com is to help entrepreneurs uh build their businesses and you know get financial freedom the way that we structured everything is i give away everything so the courses the books this book you can get for 99 cents i have this the first of a big series of volumes that i'm making of the real stuff that actually helped
(12:27) us build these companies um and then with the hopes that uh that we can help invest in some of the bigger ones that succeed using those materials so anyways lots of love keep being amazing and i will see you guys next video alright hit subscribe if you liked it and if you didn't i still love either way that's what bye

How To Create Luck - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Zvk70uj5Q

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on everyone i want to share a quick lesson that i had yesterday with my 18 year old neighbor uh who's going through his entrepreneurial journey and this is a lot of fun for me because uh he's at ground zero so i'm hearing you know the anxieties and the worries and the false beliefs kind of come up as they go and i get to you know confront them and kind of ask good questions and so uh kind of the lesson or the theme of yesterday uh was around volume and luck right and so one of the key differences that i see
(00:28) with people who are successful and do grow and do scale is that they have a firm understanding of probability all right and what that means is chance what's the percentage likelihood that something happens right if you want to be an investor right then you have to calculate the the risk associated with an investment that's a probability outcome if you are a business owner right you have to gamble on marketing and assess the probability that you'll get a return on that investment right and what's interesting is that
(01:03) volume negates luck all right so if you can put that in your brain volume negates luck and so luck is a word that people who don't understand probability use as as a space filler but if i were to say hey for every uh you know 100 000 emails i send i get 1 000 back and from 1 000 that i get back i know that i'm going to close 500 of those people on a deal that's not realistic math i would probably close a lot more than that but the point is um but if i if i explain that math to you you probably i'd be like is that luck
(01:36) that i closed 500 deals you'd probably be like no that's just probability that's just i know that if i reach this many people the probability that there is one person who's interested in the in the services that i have is high right and the thing is is that if you do enough volume you can negate luck all right you can also negate skill which is a byproduct of the volume all right so let me let me let me dive into that let me unpack that for a second so let's say you suck right because you're brand new and of course you would
(02:11) suck because why would you be good because you've never done this before whatever it is right and so this is like the conversation i'm having with my neighbor you can imagine me as like like coaching at 18 year old get him like of course you suck you're supposed to suck you're not supposed to be good right and the thing is is like because of social media because of instagram because of all these things everyone especially you know the guys who are younger right now and maybe it's the same for guys who are in their 30s whatever is that they just
(02:36) immediately assume they should be a millionaire the first year right it's just like i should be a millionaire why am i not a millionaire right and so that's what stops 99 of people from being successful because they're unwilling to suck right and it hurts their ego too much to be bad and so then they say ah this isn't for me right and so anyways back to the point of the volume versus you know negating the luck in the skill component is that let's say the normal numbers let's say i was i was coaching him on on cold calling right cause that's what
(03:05) he's doing right now and i said listen it's gonna take you know it should take you about a thousand cold calls to get you know one deal right and let's say he comes to me and he says well i've done five thousand right i'm like okay and so i don't have a deal i'm like and you suck of course you don't have a deal you've never done this before do another five thousand because the thing is eventually you will it will be unreasonable for you to suck anymore right it would be unreasonable for you to not have found one person
(03:40) if you do this for a straight year and i'm trying to paint this longer picture for him a year and i know when you're 18 a year sounds like forever but like a year if you did this for five years if you did nothing but cold call for five years do you think you would be good at cold calling he was like yeah probably i was like do you feel like you're much better now than you were one month ago when you started this he was like oh i'm like night and day better like i can get past you know i can open now i can have conversation i was getting hung up
(04:05) on i was like right and so you have this binary measure of progress which is i either closed the sale or i didn't close the sale when in reality there's tons of bricks on the bridge on the way to getting the first dollar over right and the first deal the first dollar independent of whatever you're doing is the always the hardest one and it's because you have to learn a lot of little skills before you get the big payoff right and most people learn one skill or don't learn a skill and then think up this isn't for me right and so i told
(04:34) him that the only way that i would give him my blessing for him to quit is if the enti he could convince me that the entire industry of wholesaling real estate had disappeared if you can convince me that the entire industry of wholesaling real estate has disappeared you will have my blessing to quit and obviously that's not going to happen because people have been making money in whole wholesaling real estate for a long time right there's always going to be inefficiencies in marketplaces between buyers and sellers
(04:59) right unless some magical technology comes through which it might in 10 years who knows but for right now it exists and so i said the only thing that separates you from what you want is skill and the only way to acquire that skill is volume right and the thing is is when you have enough skill you get luckier right you don't need to do 10 000 calls to get that one deal because honestly maybe in the beginning that is that is that is the biggest lay down person you'll ever have but then it gives you conviction that it can happen
(05:28) right and so um the more volume you do the better you get and therefore the luckier you become but the big picture is that people who invest people who who do business at larger scale just understand probability right they understand that there is a percentage now what's what's the the worst thing that can happen is let's say his this is this is a fun scenario to think about is let's say his first day he gets on the phone and he somehow closes the deal right and that one deal may have been that one deal out of 10 000
(06:01) that if he had started at the other end of the call list it might have taken him a month to get there but he just happens to do it first how much do you think that messes him up a ton maybe maybe or probably even more than working really hard to get there and so i don't know about you but i feel like i've definitely had occasions where i've lucked out and then i start questioning myself what am i doing different what am i doing different you might not be doing anything different you might have just hit the hit the gold
(06:24) nugget way too early in the cycle and now you got to sift through a lot more no's to get to your next one you might have to sift through twice as many notes as normal because you gotta you gotta account for the nose from the first one that you never actually hit right and so anyways as i'm walking him through this right it just reminded me of how when people are starting out they don't understand the the concept of large numbers right if you want to become lucky if you want to have probability on your side you simply
(06:51) increase n increase the number increase the volume and eventually you will strike gold and the thing is is that most people just literally don't go long enough um he honestly was doing the the little system that he's that he's purchased the wrong way up until like a week ago and so i was like cool well your first three weeks are wasted that you weren't doing it the right way right you've now officially been doing this for seven days right do you feel like it's unreasonable like do you feel like it'd be reasonable
(07:16) for you to have a top one percent income in the united states after one month of learning a new skill he was like no and i was like then stop believing you should i was like if you do this for four years because he's not right now he's pushing off college to do this i was like if you do this for four straight years i was like do you think it would be reasonable that you'd be able to close one deal a month by the end of that and he was like yeah and i was like cool then you're already twice as wealthy as the average college person
(07:40) who would be leaving right except you have four more years of experience than they do and so i'm trying to like paint these paint just give him a different frame of seeing success and seeing the work that's required to get there and i was like what happens if what happens if in six years when you're 24 what happens if in six years 24 and you're not a millionaire yet what happens that he was like i mean i'd be you know i was like what you'd be disappointed you're not a millionaire at 24.
(08:04) come on man the thing is is he might actually be right if he actually sticks with it for six straight years but most people end up hopping and and always doing these half-built bridges where they they learn two three four of the skills but there's ten that they have to learn and they say this isn't for me and they jump to another one they start building a new bridge right when the reality is you just have to keep laying the bricks keep playing the bricks keep laying the bricks all the way across the bridge from where you
(08:28) are to where you want to be and then the first dollar walks across and it takes a lot of time to put those bricks in place and to figure out which brick you're missing and the only way to do it is more and that is how you'll get better at the skill that gets the dollar across the bridge so anyways more more more sagas of my 18 year old workout afternoon uh lessons i hope you enjoy this uh if you do you know subscribe like comment all that kind of good stuff uh and i'll see you in the next video

How wealthy people avoid paying taxes..my new plan - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=52tcB5FopAg

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video i'm going to explain to you how you can get paid for your business tax-free without giving up any equity so hi if you're new to the channel my name is alex shimozzi i own acquisition.com in a portfolio of companies that is about 85 million a year i just made this channel because a lot of people are broke and i do not want you to be one of them so welcome to mosey nation so today the topic is going to be talking about debt and this is going to be one of the more um interesting chats we've had because
(00:26) this is something that i have spent a lot of time learning about and probably not in the traditional sense of like you know personal finance but more so in the kind of mergers and acquisition sense of how debt is used right and so one of the first things that i had to understand what as like as a business owner is understanding why we want to sell a business because a lot of people want to exit their business because it seems like this big aspirational goal and as somebody who has now exited six different businesses i can tell you it's
(00:52) not nearly as inspiring there's the story of the exit and there's the reality of the exit the reality of exit is that you've got transition documents not all of that cash is up front most of the time you're gonna have earn outs you're gonna have seller financing that's involved you have to roll a certain percentage of equity and you've got uh and then finally you've got cash once you have cash you have bonuses distributions you've got uh financing costs that are associated with the act transaction costs and then finally you
(01:12) have your chunk of money but wait there's another 20 that's going to go to uncle sam and then you're left with x right and sometimes x is very different from the enterprise value of what you've sold out and so one of the things that i can tell you about the wealthiest people that i know who are all over 10 figures is that the wealthiest people in the world they buy and they build and most times they don't sell even though us as entrepreneurs we have this dream of it it's usually because we're trying to get out of some
(01:34) sort of pain right because i have realized this that the times that i want to sell is when i'm in the most pain the times when i don't want to sell is when i everything's uh going well and so what i should be doing is figuring out how to get out of pain rather than trying to you know it's like there's i think there's a chinese saying to kill a mosquito with a cannon right which is like it's overkill it's like hey why don't we just solve the problem by hiring the one or two people you need to hire rather than sell the entire
(01:56) business right and so one of the things i want to introduce today along that concept is how can you still get paid or de-risk because for most business owners or entrepreneurs the majority of your networth is in your business right and or business is and so if the majority of your net worth is in this thing it's a high risk asset class i'd like to ideally share some of that risk with other people and so there are multiple different debt functions you can use but i think the easiest analogy for this is a house okay
(02:24) or an apartment building doesn't really matter so let's imagine you have a house and let's imagine that you started this except this house you were able to build without land and you were able to build it just using your own money and you actually built it yourself all right so you paid money out of pocket month over month over month and you slowly started assembling this house piece by piece by piece right and then you started getting tenants inside of it right you got little tenants in here and you know for us those are our
(02:50) customers but it functions more or less the same way you got these people that you you've been slowly filling it up and so now all of a sudden this thing spits out cash flow every month just like a rental you know apartment unit might the similarity here and i'm using this analogy because it was the one that made the most sense to me is that everything up to this point you own 100 in cash all right this is equity that you have in this house now in a normal home or you're a real estate investor you would say hey i would like to get
(03:16) higher returns because i can get all you know eighty percent of this financed through a bank right you can get a loan in the form of debt and so the example here is let's say you've got a one million dollar uh business you've got a one million dollar business right which we'll still use as this house right if this business over the next five years goes to two million dollars a year right or two million dollars in value excuse me then you would have 2x your net worth right because you own 100 of this thing now what if you were able to have your
(03:49) one million dollar thing and then split it into you keep 20 in the business right and then you get a check for 800 000 now realistically i'll tell you what the the more realistic outcome of something like this might be uh and there are two ways to do this but let's say that you did uh 30 and then 70 right so then this would be 300k and this would be 700k okay so that's that's what we would get so this would be 70 and this would be a loan now here's what's cool because this is a loan against your building this is not income
(04:27) which means you guessed it it's tax free so remember before i talked to you earlier if you were to sell a business you probably have to keep a certain percentage in because no one's going to you know just most people are not going to want you to have a full exit especially if you're a smaller business and so you would have this 80 but then this 80 would then get nixed and cut it's not going to be all cash anyways but even if it were all cash you then have to pay 20 right of that uh of that amount which would be 16 off um from whatever that
(04:54) number is which you know for math sake let's you get 760k but you have to take the 20 out so you have 560k after taxes and with you holding your 20. so this is what you'd get but here's what's crazy is that through debt you can get a 700 000 loan and still own the darn thing but here's what's cooler you now have your 1 million business that's growing to 2 million for example but then you have this this 700 000 that you have a loan from off of this that you can also still try and grow you know let's say two million
(05:26) dollars in that same time period and now you own the delta which overall your net net worth is now 3.3 million versus the original 2 million you had before and so there are two ways there are there's a lot of ways that you can you can take out a debt in the company you can do minority you can do majority you can do dividend recap there's more things that that i can get into but fundamentally just understanding that from an exit perspective this changed the way i saw business is that if you don't want to sell because you want to keep your thing
(05:53) forever totally fine but as you're keeping it it's just like an apartment building you can still refinance at regular intervals as the as the value of the property or as your business grows so that you can then then excuse me take this money out de-risk yourself and put it in other assets because let's be real we have all been through a crazy last couple years anything could happen and so for you to de-risk a little bit i think for many is a beneficial thing and candidly it's also how every ceo of a publicly traded company lives is they
(06:26) don't they never sell their equity or some of them but majority of the time they're not selling their equity they're living off of loans that are asset-based they loan against the equity that they have and the the stocks grow tax-free because they compound and then the loans are locked in which you can then refinance them later because now the asset is worth more and so you basically just gained that money for truly for you don't even have to pay it back uh or even if it was uh the same price overall you actually still got a
(06:55) discount because you didn't have to pay income tax on the loans you took against your assets right and so um i wanted to explain this because in my mind i didn't know a way to uh to to have any kind of de-risking event for myself without selling the business uh i just didn't know if there was another way and so i'm making this like i make everything in this channel is because a lot of people are broke and i know what you're one of them and i've learned you know a fair amount in the transactions that we've done and growing the companies that we
(07:22) have and i just want to share those lessons to you guys so hopefully enjoy this hopefully this is a frame shift or perspective in terms of how you see the equity uh growth in your business how you ultimately can can grow your net worth faster in a lower risk environment um that way and i'll tell you one more thing i was talking to a private equity uh managing partner andy was saying how for some of our companies for example he was like you guys don't even have uh you have you have negative leverage you say you have cash on your balance sheet he's
(07:47) like it's ridiculous he said you should be taking loans against that equity so that you can redeploy it and and do x y and z and so uh it was just a very interesting perspective i thought i would share it with you um it's something that we look to you know continue to do uh in our businesses and i figured i would share it with you because i love you guys and keeping awesome so enjoy this video enjoy the next video and i'll see you soon bye

the brutal truth behind passive income - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gZvW1Hghv6U

Transcript:
(00:00) in the last 36 months i've taken 37.9 million dollars in dividends out of my business all right so that's not business sales that's not anything else that's 39 37.9 million dollars in dividends i've taken out in the last 36 months and i wanted to lead with that mostly because i thought it would make the video a hell of a lot more interesting for those you don't know me my name is alex from mostly iowan acquisition.
(00:23) com today i wanted to talk to you uh because i had a really interesting conversation with a um a couple that's an entrepreneurial couple and i caught myself in this tirade this rant about passive income and how it's not as cool as people think it is and i wrote down some of the notes after the dinner and i thought i would share it with you because i think that passive income is one of these things that people talk about all the time it's the great a great headline for uh youtube videos and clickbait and all this crap and the
(00:55) thing is is that number one 99.9 percent of people will never have true passive income or passive income as you know in any material amount if you own stocks and you get dividends from those stocks then that is truly passive but if all you do is actively manage your passive dividend stocks then you have active income and so what i want to do in this video hopefully is make active income great again all right active income's gotten a really ugly name all right let's be real a lot of people are like ah you have a job
(01:30) you know what's real everyone has a job and everyone trades the exact same currency for the exact same output we trade time for money the only difference is that some of us have more leverage that we with which we trade that time for more money but at the end of the day we are always trading time for money period i don't care what anyone says passive just means you trade a smaller percentage and so rather than the and if you've watched my billionaire mental models video then you'll you'll find this familiar we like to speak in the
(02:01) binary of active versus passive when in reality is how passive or how active is this income stream ah interesting and what i want to do today is make an interesting argument for you about why i think passive income blows all right so let us begin number one i live in a building right now of almost exclusively eight figure nine figure and ten figure entrepreneurs so that's ten figures being billionaires 100 millionaires and deca millionaires and i will tell you this having now seen especially lots of guys uh who are in
(02:35) that category who are 40 50 sometimes 60 years old observation number one we are not meant to not work we are not meant to not work we are meant to work all right seeing these dudes pursue a pleasure filled life or a pleasure seeking life uh is one of the saddest things that you can possibly imagine it is the weirdest thing it's like seeing a tiger defanged right it's like it's it's it's not good these guys are gladiators these are guys who know how to win in the arena and i'm not trying to project my desires onto their lives it's their
(03:12) choice they can do whatever they want but me as a passive observer of looking at people that i believe care have a lot of similar character traits to me i see a different different paths that i can go down in my life and i can tell you i do not like it so number one there is no off switch on a tiger when you turn it off it's not pretty number two right now um my wife and i probably make around six million ish a year passively in terms of like we have virtually like on the let's say uh zero is you're literally doing the thing
(03:49) and ten is uh you forgot that you do that there's anything to be done uh and that would be completely passive versus completely active i'd say that we're probably like an eight and a half i'll tell you this it's not fun when we were actively involved uh in our businesses um compared to now i think honestly it was more fun um and i think a lot of people always want to you know portray that their current state is the most advanced state um and i can tell you over the last nine maybe 12 months man i've done almost nothing i mean the
(04:22) the three videos a week i make on youtube are is probably like the most uh engaging work i do it's like the only thing i'm like looking forward to uh every week because of how little that i'm doing in the business and the reason i'm bringing this up is this all right so make sure you hear the right message from this i i'm saying this in no way to flex i'm saying this because i made that the goal and i think that now that i am here i regret it i continued to solve problems in my business and i had the perspective which
(04:54) was spoken to me as a younger entrepreneur which is if you're doing something if you're actively involved in the business it means it can't run it without you which means there is something wrong which means you are not as good as an entrepreneur as you think you are because you are required to make this business work which means it's not a real business right i think that's horseshit and i think that i can tell you right now truthfully because i've walked it it's not just like a hypothetical idea like i truly do almost nothing in terms
(05:21) of what is on my calendar every day and i can tell you i'm bored out of my mind and so next next season so starting 2022 i'm gonna be doing some big stuff right but the entire goal that i optimized around four years was passive income it was i want to build a business that can run without me and from the dividends that i get from that business i can do whatever i want but here's what's crazy that they don't tell you if you love the game then why would you want to get yourself out of it huh isn't that weird it's like i love this thing i'm so good
(05:59) at it that i'm i'm going to play basketball so well that eventually i'm just going to stop playing and the team's going to win without me and so i think what i've given myself permission to do as of late is i've given myself permission to work for the love of working because i choose to and so i think that i had this idea when i was trying to scale my businesses that i wanted freedom to do whatever i wanted right we want the freedom to choose but for some reason over time that got that got morphed into everything has to be
(06:35) passive and i can tell and i'm i'm making this video so that hopefully you don't make the same mistake which is like it's okay to run your business and it's okay to like it because i i miss the [ __ ] out of it let me be honest with you i do but in an effort to create space so other people could rise up and they could have their own growth and development i moved away so that they could have that opportunity and the thing is is now i can't really jump back in the business because otherwise i would i would displace people right i'm
(07:04) not needed and so it's been an interesting interesting process for me to walk through this we have this dream we have this goal to have this thing that kicks off cash flow every single month that's far in excess of what we need to live but i am in a building where i get to see the outcome of what that looks like every day and it's not pretty and i can tell you over the last nine months 12 months of what my life has been it's not pretty it's not fun it's boring it's empty there's nothing to do and i got this quote from talking more
(07:38) and i really like it he said in the bible the first thing that god did and gave adam was not eve it was a job and i think that there's just been this this this i don't know demonic demon of demonification do you know if there's a word there yeah something bad right people have been batting um shaking their finger at work why it's what we're supposed to do and so i think that if we can focus on and this is what i this is where i'm kind of walking towards right now is is now that you at least for me this is me talking to myself is like now that
(08:18) you've you've figured out that you can truly create something that can run without you you've learned the skills of not just quote building a passive business but truly a business that can run without you and grow comma and grow all right there's one thing to create a business that can maintain without you and still continue to generate cash flow it's a totally different thing to be able to put enough talent in place that a business can grow without you that is when you actually have a business i now know that i can do that i
(08:45) can check that box off but i feel like now i can be certain in that i can make the choice to say i know that i can do that and i choose not to because i choose because it is my choice because i sought out freedom right i have the option i know that i can build that but now that i have experience and i've tasted that fruit i know that of the different flavors of fruit the one that i prefer is i prefer the challenge i prefer the game i prefer being in the game rather than watch the team win without me but i just think
(09:15) that passive income uh is not as cool as people think it is i think we need to make active income cool again we're meant to work we have the freedom to choose not the freedom to do nothing because we think that we're we want to have freedom do all the [ __ ] that we want to do but the thing is is in the in the course of building the life that we have there's nothing that's that gives you the rush of business nothing's as high octane as this right and stuff that is as high acting as that if done enough times eventually you're gonna die you
(09:42) got into this game you had these things in these hobbies that you enjoyed you get rid of those hobbies to go double down on the game you go and you continue to play the game you eventually win the game right and then you look back and now you have all this time because you continue to trade things to get more time back get more time back get more time back and eventually you have all your time back but you have nothing to [ __ ] do and so then you're stuck in the position that i'm in right now which is what do i enjoy
(10:10) and i enjoy doing the things that got me here and so that is what i'm going to be doing in the next the next chapter 2022 is i'm going to be doubling down very aggressively and you'll be seeing some moves from behind the sidelines behind the behind the glass of what i'll be doing but i'll tell you that seeking pleasure is not the game it's incredibly boring um and uh and yeah this is something that no one ever shared with me and i figured i would share it with you because moseynation you guys [ __ ] rock love you guys um
(10:39) and if you're new to this world uh i think i said at the beginning but if i didn't my name is auction mosey on acquisition.com we do about 85 million a year and if you enjoyed this video i'm glad you did and keep being awesome and i'll see you guys in the next one

Why PRETENDING to be RICH will make you POOR.. - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ebrcIErJi10

Transcript:
(00:00) hi alex i have a business mentor who is telling me that i should fake it until i make it it sounds contrary to what you say on your youtube channel and i don't know who to trust and so i wanted to hear your explanation for why you don't believe in that concept what's up everybody mozy nation rocking and rolling my name is alex muzzy if you're new to the channel um and we have a portfolio of companies that does about 85 million dollars a year all right i make this channel because a lot of people are broke and i don't want you to
(00:31) be one of them so welcome to mozzie nation all right so to hit on this question right should i fake it till i make it um this is something that is really close to home for me uh because i uh it drives me absolutely bonkers and so i'll tell you a quick story um and then and we can go from there to illustrate the point so uh this is probably five years ago maybe six years ago somewhere in there um i was showing up to our first event of our licensees all right so we only had 28 licenses at the time and this is the first event all
(00:57) right and as a side note if you're curious why i have a mustache this story will explain it to you so i was so nervous the night before that i for for the two-day event that we were going to have to provide value and all that kind of stuff um that i had this big beard and so i shaved it off and i was doing you know wolverine then mutton chops then gunslinger and then all the way i had i left down to a porn stash and i look outside the bathroom and i look at layla i was like hey baby um and she cracked up and she was like please
(01:22) don't do that i looked back in the mirror and i cracked up and i was like you know what i'm doing it i'm rocking the stash because i was so nervous and so stressed about this day tomorrow that i wanted to give myself a reason to not just not take myself so seriously right because i was like you know what worst case scenario i'm gonna die and no one's gonna remember who i am anyways so anyways i show up the next day and i pull up right as we're pulling up to the hotel which is where the event is right and uh we're pulling up in a prius that
(01:46) has a dent in the side and a crack in the windshield and one of licensees comes up to me and uh and she says and as she's walking at the same time and sees that so she stops and walks over and um she says hey uh i thought you were supposed to be rich and you can imagine the terror right because this is the you know impostor syndrome that i'm dealing with the night before right now mind you at this point i already had six gyms we sold them and then i'd already done 30 plus turnarounds right so like i was very good at the thing that we're talking
(02:14) about right but i still have this i still remember the the shock but what i said next is the reason that i have always been transparent with my numbers when we do well when we not do well in terms of how we do our lifestyle et cetera all right and so at the time i was a cash millionaire so a million dollars in my bank account right and i hadn't even started investing stuff yet so side note i think making sure you have the right sequence is important but a million dollars saved up in my bank account after taxes at this moment
(02:40) and when she said this i just remember thinking i was like oh my god am i a fraud and then the reality of my situation not the fakeness of my situation was what came forth to hold me strong in that moment and i said you should see my bank account not my car and i was like i'm all i was like you want to be rich not not look rich right she was like yeah and i was like well that's what i'm here to show you how to do and then the rest the event was awesome and then all the people two weeks later all the dudes had stashes
(03:08) without me saying anything so i think they liked it and then that is what gave birth to the stash which you know has still still been pervasive in many of the marketing things that we've done all right but here's the reason that i'm i'm i'm actually against the fake it so you make it the first is that you in the mirror at night know that you're a fraud i mean and that's the biggest thing at the end of the day if you've heard anything that i've ever talked about is that you have to have conviction in what you sell right and the the thing at the
(03:31) very most that you are selling is you are selling yourself to yourself and if you are lying to everyone else about how successful you are then you're trying you're you're cheating you're you're you're deceiving yourself and that kind of integrity is very hard to recapture because the hardest person's respect to earn is your own in my opinion right once you have your own respect everyone else's respect comes pretty easily because they know that you respect you and so i know this is deep stuff but like at the end of the
(03:57) day like entrepreneurship is is a journey of beliefs right it's a journey about building your character and about acquiring skills and the businesses are only a reflection or a manifestation of the internal changes that we've had or experienced as entrepreneurs which is why i think entrepreneurship is the single greatest personal development path you can possibly go on here's some other reasons why i think this is stupid and mind you at the time when i had a million dollars my bank account laila and i were living together
(04:20) on twelve hundred dollars a month of rent and about four hundred dollars ish a month in food so 100 bucks a week in food 1200 a month in rent and that's what we were living on and we were taking home at the time three or four hundred thousand a month all right so just for context i'm just and i i've never had a really expensive watch the only really expensive thing that i've purchased uh that was a waste was a bentley which i actually already sold and gave it away i'm sure i could come up with some sexy youtube headline for
(04:44) that but we just gave it back because i didn't need it and i didn't want it it felt like a waste and it felt contrary to who i am and what i believe it right at the end of the day if you decide what your values are first and you live your life in accordance with those values rather than what you think the world wants you to do then you will be able to stand steadfast and strong in the face of adversity with full knowledge of who you are and i think that the strength of that cannot be understated i've said this quote many times in our communities
(05:09) and on this channel which is you must outwork yourself doubt right if you feel like you are not confident then you must outwork the things that you were insecure about if you're like man i'm selling these services and i don't show i'm not sure if i'm not good at them then do more of them and don't pretend honesty is one of the most compelling and convicting things for persuading people right saying what you are good at and what you are not good at truthfully will win you far more followers and fans and and loyal customers and loyal
(05:35) employees than pretending because the end of the day they can feel that you are disingenuous because they know that is hollow they know that the inside you do not believe the words that are coming out of your mouth and that is how people speak without conviction and they cannot sway others because they have not swayed themselves because they have lost their own respect and so i am not the believer in buying the ferrari when you can't afford it i am not the believer in in affording the home and paying for the
(05:59) home that you cannot afford because you want to pretend like this is the lifestyle that you want to be around if you go under the guise of networking you can still go to those places without buying a four million dollar house when you you're barely making you know a few hundred thousand dollars a year it doesn't make sense i like jay-z's quote around this which is if you can't buy something twice don't buy it once i really like that and so this is one of the most common questions i get for newer entrepreneurs because
(06:23) they think that they have to they have to they have to pose on instagram in order to get to get wealthy and what it does is it conflates sequence jeff bezos is famous because of what he did not because he became famous as jeff bezos and then used his following to build something elon musk is famous for what he's accomplished not for being elon musk and then creating something as a result right let the actions be the thing that gives you the fame rather than yourself right at least that is that is alex's two cents in my viewpoint on the world
(06:50) and i think most of those mozi nation you guys uh share that belief with me and for those of you who are new to this channel um you're gonna get more of this type of stuff uh and none of the fake it till you make it nonsense that is a sure way to be broke and i will tell you this as a last thing the amount of people who in 2008 when everything crashed who were faking it until they quote made it just faked it until they lost it all because they lost what little amount that they had because they were so overextended but i can tell you that
(07:22) just about everyone can become wealthy if you choose to live on lower on less than you make right and that is a ratio wealth is a ratio not a number all right and so anywho uh if you are having struggles with this question i would posit i would i would beg of you that you build your own respect first that you're honest with yourself first and if you always maintain the integrity of hey last year we we got smashed right this year we'll do a little bit better and two years from now when you do even better than that you can be truthful and
(07:55) people will believe you but if you always are telling a story about how you're always doing so well a everyone will hate you b no one cares and c you will know that you are full of it and at the end of the day i think that is the only thing that we're going to keep with us and when we die everyone's going to forget about us anyways so you might as well at least enjoy yourself while you're alive so anyways keep being awesome mosey nation if you enjoyed this subscribe if you did lots of love either way keeping awesome i'll catch you next

A Hard Learned Lesson (ALEX HORMOZI) - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Kt-EYieNko

Transcript:
(00:00) every time i take a step towards kind of a better ideal in this direction i make significantly more money and so i figured i'd share it with you but uh recently i've been spending a lot of time reading um and specifically reading from people who make a lot more money than i do and i think that i haven't had a good um kind of a little bit more head of a podcast until recently so i'm going to try and break that streak today so one of the hardest learn lessons that i've i mean and i'm still actively learning it but every time i take a step
(00:28) towards kind of a better ideal in this direction i make significantly more money and so i figured i'd share it with you so um in some of my earlier podcasts i talk a lot about focus right about learning to say no and i think that over the last year and a half two years um there have been my hardest learned lessons were where i said yes to opportunities that were now at a larger size than what i used to learn to say no to and so i've referenced the opportunities that that come to us as like the woman in the red dress if you're familiar with
(00:59) the matrix is that the thing is is that at every opportunity level as you level up the opportunities become sexier right the woman in the red dress becomes more attractive because you know in the very beginning before you've made any money anything is attractive you say yes to anything but then as you acquire more and more skills more and more opportunities open up and better and better opportunities open up which is why you have to like relearn the same same concept but at a different level right because at one point you don't say you you say
(01:29) yes to a 10 million opportunity or one million dollar opportunity everything's relative right but at another level you have to learn to say no to that if you were above that at that certain time and i think i've made that mistake multiple times at different levels and so i'm partially making this you know video for me and so um there's a book called the road less stupid it's really really good i'd highly recommend it especially if you're an entrepreneur and especially if you're prone to getting excited about new ideas
(01:58) constantly wanting to innovate constantly wanting to tweak and change things which is really really you know the thing that excites us a lot and it's a lot of times it's the the key to to big breakthroughs that being said one of the quotes i used to quote a lot was from jeff bezos who said um basically business is different from baseball in that uh in business uh in baseball when you swing for the fences the most you can ever score is four runs right but in business every once in a while when you step up to the plate if
(02:24) you hit the ball hard enough you can score a thousand runs and um so big people who bet big win big but they bear the cost of experimentation right and so um the he references earlier on in that in that little address that he said if you have a chance of a hundred times payoff and you've got a one out of chance 10 chance of hitting it you should take that bet every time and after having thought about this i mean jeff obviously makes a lot more money than i do um i think that that's not it's correct mathematically but in
(02:54) practicality i think there's another sentence that needs to be added to it and so to give it a realistic context imagine you're going to the casino and that's the bet right that's the bet is uh you have to put uh let's say ten dollars down and you can win a thousand but you've got a one out of ten chance right now here's where it makes it realistic let's say you only go into the casino with thirty 30 then what do you do think about it so that means that if you were to bet three times you've got a one you've only
(03:25) you've only got a one out of three chance of ever of coming out of the casino with anything right and so that's i think a more realistic paradigm for what most entrepreneurs go into because you have a constrained amount of capital money and a constraint amount of time and resources and bandwidth for your team and so kind of adapting that extra sentence on there of just understanding that there's a cost to making that bet it's not just oh if i have a 1 out of 10 chance of scoring a thousand then i should definitely make that bet
(03:53) every time for a 10 bet yes you absolutely should mathematically and in jeff's case he's had access to unlimited money virtually unlimited money for 20 years he's been able to re raise funding um and fun i mean they have 500 million dollar mess-ups and they're like whoops that didn't work but a lot of us don't have that and so um there's in the in the the book the road less stupid he gives a context um that i think has really really been useful for me even lately in making decisions about opportunities right it's the
(04:25) things that i have to say no to and so the three questions are really simple which is why i've been using them so much which is what's my upside what's my downside and can i live assuming that the downside's gonna happen and so the third question stated a little bit differently but that's how i'm using it and um in phrasing the three questions that way it's helped me so much in saying no right in like man why don't we try this new follow-up sequence so that we can get you know more leads in well what's the what's my upside maybe i get a 10 boost
(05:00) what's my downside i lose 50 because the test doesn't work or it bombs because what i'm going against is a control which has already been tested against other things and is working and can i live with my downside of losing fifty percent for the hopes of gaining ten no i can't because i'm gonna assume i'm gonna make that loss and so then i just say no and what's happening is it's giving me so much attention back so that when i'm making my bets because ultimately if you really think about what business is it at it's very basic
(05:27) it's just betting which is why a lot of entrepreneurs love gambling uh because it's what we do we do it in a controlled setting it's like you know business is the ultimate version of poker right like poker is a combination of skill and luck right business i would say is even more skill and still a little bit of luck and so it just has more skill under control but the other day there's still bets they're replacing it's not just on black and black and red it's should i hire a salesperson first or should i spend more
(05:53) on this marketing campaign uh should i test out this new follow-up sequence or should we try and run seo uh or should we do cold outbound messenger right and so it's like all of these things are decisions where you're choosing between two different opportunities and i think if you apply that framework that three question framework it's been i just like for me it's been a game changer it's been so helpful um and we've seen you know huge reaps you know we've reaped the benefit in the business um just in the last 90
(06:22) days even during covid we've had some explosive growth i'll tell you more about it in a couple months um but it's been in really trying to hone that discipline and i feel like at every level you get that that discipline muscle gets stronger and stronger and stronger and the things that i'm able to say no to get better and better and better and so um one of the things that if you look at if you study like charlie munger they talk about the best the best bettors the best gamblers actually bet the the least frequently
(06:49) they actually bet the fewest amount of times but when they met they bet big and so um i'm trying to really apply that and with it when they bet big they bet on what they call no brainers right it shouldn't be like you should have in their mind virtually no chance of not succeeding when you make the bet right and then if you think about that then you're like well shoot there's i mean when will i ever see those types of bets if you look at them over 40 years they only have 15 bets that have created all of the the billions that they've been
(07:18) able to generate 15 15 winning bets out of all the bets they've made have been the winning bets that got them to where they are and i think that in business it's a lot like that so let me just tell you one one quick anecdote to wrap this up to make this real for you tell me if this sounds realistic you get really excited about a new concept a new idea that you think you're going to test out right and you you pitch it to the team you let them know what's going to happen you're saying we're starting on monday this
(07:46) could be the new way we do things the team's not 100 um trained up on it but they're kind of you know fly as you go your feet is king let's rock and roll with this thing and after a month or two months you look back at your stats and they're pretty much the same maybe even a little bit less but there's like three other things that happen during that same period of time so like i don't know if it was this or it was because the new process honestly you know there's this and that and then all of a sudden you realize that you didn't even get a
(08:15) definitive answer on the test that you ran um and you definitely didn't get the result that you were hoping for and so what ends up happening is that your company and you incurred this enormous cost of change without real like without any real upside and so in in thinking through the bets that i'm making now i'm assuming the cost and what i mean like i'm assuming that i'm to have the downside even the one that i'm understanding but i'm assuming there's going to be some that are unknown that i'm going to have to incur
(08:45) and so when i'm making that assumption which is that third question which is and can i live with it assuming that it does happen i ca it's just like it's been it's been so illuminating for me and so helpful for me because what happens is you get in these vicious cycles especially um especially if you're in an emotional situation right because i know a lot of a lot of um where a lot of business owners in general right now are cash constrained they're trying to figure out what to do they're trying to pivot fast
(09:09) make fast decisions on on incomplete information sometimes that's just the name of the game right um but in doing that um they're they're hoping for the hail mary and so their internal optimism which is what leads them to be an entrepreneur ends up ends up weighing against them it ends up stacking the chips against them because that one thing which has been your your hope right your greatest strengths can become your greatest weakness as an entrepreneur there's no different right our optimism can become our achilles
(09:40) heel because we believe that the chance of success is actually greater than it really is and we underestimate the cost of taking the bet and that's where we get [ __ ] right and so when you go back to the casino and when you're considering the bets and you're like man if this hits this could be 10 times what we're doing right now right but just remember you only might have three bets to make and you got a one out of ten shot so use them wisely so anyways i hope that was useful for you it's been incredibly useful for me um i've been saying no to
(10:12) way more um tests and tweaks and variations and and and and and just small things that would really distract the team and just saying guys we're just going to keep we're going to keep focusing on executing we're going to keep focusing on doing better at the fundamentals and it continues to pay dividends because the team doesn't have to be scattered they just have to think how can we get one percent better every day rather than one percent better for two weeks and then change everything and then one percent better for two weeks and then
(10:38) change everything right um where they never actually get to get that long-term compounding uh improvement which is what ultimately will separate you over time so like i said hope that was valuable for you it's been it's been a huge lesson for me and in studying some of the the greats the all-time greats seeing how they make decisions seeing where they place their bets um i wish i had learned it earlier um but hopefully i can pass you know at least that that nugget on too because it's been really helpful for me so lots of love keep being
(11:06) awesome hope you ever meet saturday and um hopefully a beautiful view here from the from bear lake and i'll catch you guys soon [Music]

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on everyone i have been known as the partnership killer uh and so what i want to share to you with you today is something that comes up on i mean every week on coaching calls with uh you know younger entrepreneurs younger business owners not even younger just other business owners who aren't doing as much and who want more and the question is usually one of two things first is you know what should our roles be within our partnership and then two what do you think of partnerships in general and so what i want to do is
(00:29) share with you a couple of hard hard hard earned lessons uh that i have and so first right off the bat i i think i counted i have nine failed partnerships um and so i just want to say right right before you even get going i could be the problem with the partnerships right if if you have that many failed partnerships then it's probably you you were the common theme so i will say that first and foremost up front um that being said i think the reason that many of those partnerships fell they all happened you know
(00:57) almost concurrently i just did partnership after partnership for partnership because i heard it's like you gotta find good partners um but what i didn't understand was how it actually needed to be structured and how it worked and so there's uh there's there's a few pieces of that the first is if you're just starting out i think that for the most part it's better to not have partners um and that is because usually it's like you and a buddy and you're like hey we like hanging out we should go into business together
(01:22) when really you're doing that for the emotional need to be satisfied to have somebody to talk to and share the experience with but not because it's a good business decision and the only reason for you to have a partner is because they either have money or skills that you do not have that is it it's the only reason money or skills that's it and so if you both are entrepreneurial people and you're both you know love selling and love marketing you're very promotion oriented which many entrepreneurs are right if that's you then
(01:49) if they're that way too then one of you is not required and you have to really face that so if you both like the same stuff you both shouldn't have your own businesses it almost always fails like literally it almost always fails and so that's the first one the second thing is that those jump into bed together partnerships don't have step number two which is you don't have a contract you don't have terms you don't have an agreement and the reason is because you're so afraid of like messing up the vibe we don't operate that way
(02:18) you will when it gets up at the end but i'm telling you right now i i now even when i have somebody who approaches me and says hey like will you take a percentage of my company can you coach me through this blah blah i say let's go through the lawyers first all right because the thing is is you get to see how this person acts under stress because it is stressful because inherently you're going to disagree on things and so this is the perfect experience like perfect time for you to go kind of get a simulation
(02:44) of that it's like what happens if you don't want to work and i want to work what happens if you leave what happens if i i don't want to do this anymore like you have to go through all the scenarios and get a good lawyer and you should really have two that represent you uh if you don't have the money for that then get somebody to just counsel you on you know you can google a standard partnership agreement their templates are free online and you can pay one lawyer for one hour of of time to at least say these are the things you should look for
(03:10) now you know decide amongst yourselves and so you can represent yourself in your partnership you know agreement but you have to have the agreement and you have to spell it out in clear terms uh because if you don't have that it's like it's the bedrock of good communication and expectations right like otherwise usually like most relationships bit partnerships end because of unmet and unspoken expectations like well i thought you're going to do this i was like well i didn't know but no one even says that because they can't communicate so
(03:37) first is you probably shouldn't just jump together with somebody because they uh they're just like you if you are going to do that then you should make sure that you have contracts in place and then finally what i want to do is kind of explain to you what the three main roles roles that exist in a business are okay three the three pillars all right i want to see if i have a tripod here all right here we go here's my tripod all right so there's three pillars to every business all right the first is acquisition which is the rainmaker or
(04:08) somebody who's gonna bring in business so that's marketing and sales all right acquisition the money getter all right the second of these is the product which is what you are actually selling it's the fulfillment it's the service it's the widget it's the whatever somebody who knows how to deliver it all right and then third you have the operations which is everything else that has to happen in the company paying payroll paying taxes making sure legal and contracts and uh i.
(04:38) t and uh you know finance and all like the you know your accounting all of that stuff hr has to happen right and so these are the three legs of every business now they're not necessarily equally weighted and that's an it's an important point right like a lot of times there are good operators that you can get for significantly less and many times not even equity because there are more of them right now raid making being able to bring in business is a very highly valued skill in the marketplace on the flip side having the thing the product that you're going to sell
(05:07) is also very valuable now this is why skill stacking is so important if you can have multiple of these skills then you have two or all three of the legs right now your these are the roles that have to exist it doesn't mean you have to be partners with these people but you have to have all three of these things for your business to stand up and so for example within uh the company i'll walk through my roles within each of the companies that i own and so uh the first is gym launch right so in gym launch i am both the
(05:38) acquisition and the product right or that was my founding role within the company layla my wife runs ran all the operations so everything else so like i said i t billing legal uh finance hr all of that stuff that had to happen she took care of right super important but because of that we had all three legs of the stool and we were able to build a business right if you're missing one of the legs it's not going to work right and with this is where this is really dangerous is like a lot of the marketing people that are in this world
(06:09) are really good promoters they can get people in they can sell them but then they have no fulfillment they have no thing right and then they have no one who's organized and so everything like you send emails in you try and get help and they don't respond it's because they just don't have the other piece i don't think it's because they're bad intention i think just don't have the skill and so you have to have all three and so if you're going to bring someone in you you need them to have one of those things right now you can start a
(06:33) business and own all of it and just make sure that you fill the roles of those people but as you're thinking through it there's the role so if you're going to bring partners in in the beginning you want to be clear about what it is that they're bringing to the table now if they're if they're one of those three right then that's a clearly defined role and then at that point that's what you can lay out in your agreement and then you can argue about or you know negotiate whatever equity if you're doing this in the beginning
(06:57) but if you've already started at that point then you can look at the three legs of the stool and see where where am i lacking right and so for most of you guys who are listening most people follow me are on the or like the promotion side so they like the acquisition side then what you need to do is find a strong operator all right and depending on what you're selling if you know the thing that you're selling then you can basically be product and acquisition and have a strong second to help you fulfill on those things and basically
(07:24) don't go to jail right and you know get buy your taxes and all the other stuff um and so when i'm thinking about partnerships and when i have you know younger guys who are coming in many many times after having discussions with me and then talking to them each other they realize that they have the exact same role they like the same things and one of them is not necessary and so they oftentimes split and that's not a bad thing right it's better to recognize an error early than to recognize an error late all right and so you may be in one of these
(07:50) partnerships where you're like we gotta both do the same thing we kind of just overlap on everything it's like yeah that's just two people working the same thing um and so it's not like you don't want to just be like oh there here's all this work i'll do half you do have that's not a good partnership you have to figure out what are the things where i am good at what are the things you are good at and then we draw a line on the board and everything on that side you own and everything on this side i own and i'm responsible for because if
(08:11) everyone's responsible for everything no one's responsible for anything right and then nothing's gonna get done and then you can never know who to blame and someday you're like well he takes out the trash or something i take out the trash and we just kind of we're just like kind of get it done type stupid there's no there's no big business that works away all right and so if even if you are small you need to start thinking big to become big right so you got to do the actions before you get the results you have to
(08:32) have the beliefs before you get the outcomes of a bigger business to become a bigger business and the reason most businesses stay small is because they think small and they act small so they stay that way because the outcome of what they're doing is the result of the actions they're making which are small right and so right now if you're in a partnership if you don't have a partnership you're thinking about starting a business i would definitely try and just acquire the skills myself get going and then the first hire i'm going to have is
(08:56) going to be a strong operational second all right it's the first thing i'm going to do if you are in a partnership you need to put all the activities that you do on a board i do this when i do consulting stuff but all the activities that happen in the business on a board if you don't know what it is you do a time study which means you write down every 15 minutes what you do in a week right because you probably don't know because you're scattered all over the place so if you write it all down and you both bring it to each other and you put it on
(09:18) a whiteboard or put it on a board then what you can do is say okay these are all the things these are all the activities that happen in our business let's divide these out and say who owns these all right and that's the very beginning of an organization because you are becoming organized you are creating roles and responsibilities you were creating specialization of skills which is what moved humanity forward specialization is a good thing right and so the very beginning you get all of it on there and you can divide it
(09:41) out and you can divide it based on the skills of the person if you both have the same skills then either you decide okay well i'm going to become a specialist in this and you're going to become a specialist in this or we shouldn't be doing this business together and you should do a business that's just like mine or or something else and you should become and you should be that role for that company and you should find a second just like i will all right and oftentimes if you can at least think that way then you don't lose you don't liquidate
(10:03) the most valuable thing in the whole world which is your equity all right because if your thing actually does grow if your business actually does grow then the biggest dilution of how much money you're going to make is that first decision when you started when you just decided just right off the bat to give half of everything away all right and i've made this mistake nine times um and uh it took me and you know i haven't had a partner in four years and i've made all of the money in my life post partners and so um
(10:34) there's also other factors you want to look at too like what kind of you know what kind of working schedule do you have how much vacation time do you wanna have are you gonna work weekends do you work late at night do you work in the mornings do you expect each other to be responsive like there's all these little things that you need to make sure you dial in because if you don't it's just going to cause trouble later and it may be hard conversations for you now but believe me it'll be much harder later when the expectations are not being met
(10:55) and now you have money involved all right so anyways these are the things i think through when i'm looking at partners and partnerships and why oftentimes i do break up many partners because they don't start them for the same for the right reasons um and so i hope you found this valuable if you have a partner talk to them about it show them this video um and uh keeping amazing and uh lots of love oh total bonus um i have noticed that works really well so many times is married couples uh married couples starting business
(11:21) together they already have usually differences in skills and different dynamics and so that usually works well usually one of them is the more go-getter hunter killer right you know the acquisition side and the other person's usually the more organized more stable um you know more even-headed like does all the ops in the back the back-end stuff right and so even just thinking about front-end and back-end is a good way to start and that's why i love having married couples in general because they almost always are
(11:46) successful if they can just eliminate those skills and they usually already have even even without speaking they already unknowingly have made a lot of these specializations that's why a lot of times they're more successful they also have the interpersonal emotional uh sounding board to bounce things off of and also relieve some of the stress that inevitably comes when you're when you're running a business so anyways hope you enjoyed the video hope you found this valuable uh you know share with your partner or potential
(12:08) partners and uh see in the next vid bye

Hard Money Lending EXPLAINED [I lent $3,000,000 using this] - YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gxKxeie5JFo

Transcript:
(00:00) 100 days ago i made an investment that pays me 3 300 per day in profit off of a single deal that was struck and i told you about this at the beginning of the deal um what was going to happen and so i wanted to do this as kind of a part two um of what actually happened in actuality for those of you who don't know me my name is alex from ozio and acquisition.
(00:21) com uh it's a portfolio of companies that's about 85 million a year the reason for this channel is because i know a lot of people are broke and i don't want you to be one of them all right so one of the things that i like a lot is hard money lending a big fan of it it's private lending which is basically like you are the bank and the reason i like this is because you can determine the deal structure which means that you can create the upside and the downside and then it's up to the other party of whether or not they want to accept that
(00:42) and that's valuable because if you can control a lot of the variables and you can you can mitigate downside risk which if you've heard any of my stuff the ultra wealthy out there it's not about trying to hit their upside like everybody who's poor buys lottery tickets because they only think about upside but they don't think about downside everybody was rich who doesn't do that because they understand downside risk and how getting rich is about really just making fewer mistakes and letting time become an ally rather than
(01:05) a liability using time as an asset rather than something that is working against you what i'm going to do is i'm going to outline the deal structure of what we agreed on um and then what happened and then there was one really curious thing that happened that was actually awesome and i think was probably the biggest takeaway from me and hopefully uh for you in this process big picture here this was a two and a half million dollar note all right so i wired two and a half million dollars in cash to a buyer all right and the buyer
(01:31) went to buy a building out of uh foreclosure all right so they had a 334 unit which if you're like holy cow how's the 334 unit building two and a half million hence the reason i was happy to do the deal all right it was also in a war zone like the police officers don't even go here um this was a deal in memphis and so it's 334 unit building all right it was it was basically condemned they're squatters drug dealers you know all sorts of stuff right and so here here are the here are the risk factors right which is what if i don't
(01:59) get the money back right which means that i would have a building and then how can i make sure that i get the money back all right so the first layer of defense here is guarantees all right so both of the buyers these two two people um personally guaranteed the money all right and they had net worths in excess of two and a half million all right so we had that going for us times two next the building itself we have the value right which the question is well if it was condemned and all that kind of stuff do we know what
(02:28) the value is like is it really worth two and a half million dollars would you ever be able to sell it good question so we had uh three offers already on the building for between 5 million and 5.6 million so an offer is one thing right but is there another level we can have there was actually somebody put earnest money down meaning that they they had made the offer and it was accepted and they were going to put money in the deal so there's earnest money of 300k so they had said we want to buy it it was these guys the 5.6 guys
(02:56) right earnest money 300 000 in the deal saying that as soon as you guys can transfer the title over to us then great all right and the last thing was was to make sure that we were actually in this sounds minor but this is how a lot of deals get messed up that we were actually on the title right so that means that if for some reason we do not uh we do not get repaid we are the first uh the first you know the first people who have ownership or entitlement rather you know titled uh to the property all right so that
(03:22) there's no uh other liens against the property that we're the only ones um who are going to be uh receiving the property if something went in default right and so our cash was used to pay off the last person who had a lien on the home as our on the homes of the building and then we took over that position as preferred and so this was kind of the deal structure all right now this is how we got paid all right so these are the payment terms so it was four percent per month all right now four percent times 2.5 million if you're curious
(03:49) right dude to do is a hundred thousand dollars per month all right so i was making a hundred thousand dollars per month for the last three and a half months um for them to hold this money now after the fourth month so for some reason they hadn't done this deal in four months which it was supposed to be done in 60 days which it wasn't so i'll talk about that in a second right so if it was uh if it was done in uh if it took four plus months the interest rate would double all right so then it would go to 200 000 per month all right because then
(04:19) it starts to reflect that there might be more risk here right so i need to start getting compensated more for this all right on top of that what we did was a two month minimum carry uh which basically just means that uh even if they do the deal in 20 seconds i still get two months of carry which means minimum of 200k i'm gonna get back for just risking the two and a half million which means i'm getting eight percent or whatever um no matter what just for doing this deal so that's the minimum of 200k because there's a minimum two month
(04:43) carry all right that's the key point here beyond that what happened is after uh this deal ended up closing um here's what happened so uh the individuals who did the deal they flew out to see us and have a kind of like a celebratory dinner this was kind of interesting so they're like hey your lawyer sent over the note um and it looked a little light and i was like uh what do you mean they were like well uh you know we've had the we've had the property for a hundred plus days now right and the note said 275k and i was like huh and they're like yeah
(05:14) i mean that wasn't what we agreed on we agreed on paying you more than that and so this is so here's what happened right so our lawyers messed up for lack of a better term they just messed up when they sent the uh the the loan invoice for repayment at the end of this and what was interesting is that this individual because he is long-term minded as well and also a high ultra high net worth individual and this is why i think this is probably more valuable than the deal itself was like yeah my lawyer saw it he was
(05:43) saying his lawyer saw it and said yeah let's just send the money like and you know they made a mistake let's let's move on right and save ourselves you know almost 100 grand which i'll show you in a second what the actual amount was and he said ah man he's like now you can't be my lawyer anymore and he was telling me this story over dinner and it was so funny because we both had this kind of same so the more deals you do with someone there's a big five letter word that starts to occur which is trust right the
(06:09) more times you lend someone money the more times they pay it back as agreed upon right and especially if you have an instance where they have the opportunity to screw you over where most people would especially if they think that they that you'll that you won't find out which we might not have found out but the thing is i might have also looked at these notes a while later and been like like if i had free time and been like this is off what is this right and so anyways he caught it his lawyer caught it his lawyer said to go forward with it
(06:35) anyways he chose not to and to bring it to our attention and so we obviously are not going to use our lawyer anymore he is not going to use his lawyer anymore because our guys made us a stupid boneheaded mistake and that's what we pay them for is to not make these mistakes and double check these things right and his made it ethical error right so mine was an error on skill his was an error on ethics and if you remember my how i pick mentors and vendors video i talk about the three circles right you have the skill you
(06:59) have the the ethical component then you have the hard working component and so both these guys worked hard but they didn't have this one of them didn't have the skill and the other one didn't have the ethics so this is what ended up happening all right so 275 was the deal instead uh we did the we had it was a hundred and something days or whatever so we had 300 k plus 33 33 33 per day um until the deal was closed all right and so it ended up being like 350 k or something like that with decimals right that we got paid back plus the 2.5
(07:33) million all right so we got to check back for 2.85 million and we have trust which is the most valuable thing that you can have right and so this is this is ultimately one of those currencies that people do not understand who are new to business is that trust is the most valuable thing i mean we were talking about this over dinner and he was like you only get one name you know what i mean you only get one you only get one name you only get one uh reputation see if i cannot get the sun in my eyes here you only get one and uh
(07:59) you know we're obviously you know hoping to do bigger and bigger deals with you guys is uh you know we earn more and more trust and we can do you know 10 million deals 50 million deals um and we'd rather have partners that we know uh we can rely on and so it goes both ways and so anywho uh this was a very valuable experience for me in two ways one obviously because the the the whole deal worked out uh and for those who were like why don't you run a mastermind it's like because i could just move the money and not do anything and make almost 400
(08:26) that is why i'm just being transparent with you guys like that's why i don't sell anything on the channel that's why the the the trainings we have on acquisition.com are free for all entrepreneurs and the book is 99 cents you can get it on amazon because i just want everyone to win so anyways this is the deal a lot of people like no one taught me how to do this stuff so it was me just trying to figure this out as i go so hopefully you can think through some of these variables if you ever get in that situation
(08:45) and then also uh just a side note here i do have to pay 50 in taxes on this and so that's why you need for me i have to have really high returns on any kind of private lending because uh the the i have to realize those gains right and they're not capital gains to regular income and so uh when you have that i'm actually only making 175 after after taxes on this deal which you know in terms of percentages on on on my original i still want to loan that money out again you know again this year uh so that i can still get at least you know 10 or 20
(09:16) return on it that's the big deal in terms of the money stuff uh the bigger deal was the trust and the value of having trusted partners uh because they are worth their weight in gold and uh you know we should only be so lucky to have a handful of uh people that you can trust uh throughout your business career and uh you know my hope is that from this channel that you are one of them um in terms of uh in terms of yourself and then also maybe you know you grow your business to three or five or ten million a year and then
(09:41) you let us uh invest with you so we can help you grow more so anyways uh keep being awesome moseynation love you uh if you enjoyed this video hit the subscribe button if you didn't enjoy the video love you anyways and i'll see you guys in the next vid keep being awesome lots of love bye

Transcript:
(00:00) mosey nation two days ago i was speaking with some business owners that approached me about becoming portfolio companies and acquisition.com and i want to talk to you about how that conversation went um and i want to give you one of the most useful frameworks that i use in analyzing a business that you can use today to analyze your own business and instantly 2-3 exit which is exactly what i do when i'm looking at the portfolio companies that we're considering on investing in the beautiful thing about this equation
(00:24) and as you as you develop as an entrepreneur at least as i have and just so you if you guys don't know who i am my name is alex romozy on acquisition.com our portfolio companies do about 85 million a year and so the reason i make this channel is because a lot of people are broke and i want you to be one of them and mozilla nation is not going to be one of them everyone needs if you are good at something you need tools all right this equation is one of those tools that you have as an entrepreneur if you have to rely on your
(00:43) your systems if you have to rely on finance to get you the reports to get to make general directional decisions then you're going to be weak as an entrepreneur because you have to be able to do these calculations in your head back of napkin all right and so i want to show you the most valuable equation that i use in analyzing my own businesses and potential portfolio companies and it requires five variables and i'm going to show you what they are and then i'm going to show you how i got the two hardest numbers that most people
(01:08) don't know how to get within their business all right so i can even give you the six number which will be a bonus one number one is going to be number of new sales per month most people know this number the next one is current revenue so that's most people also know this number the next number is price most people know this number the next number is going to be churn most people do not know this number the next number is going to be lifetime value most people do not know this number the next number is gross profit
(01:35) all right so i'm going to show you how in a simple conversation we can figure out all of these things and extrapolate where business is going to cap out where the weak points are and how we can see what the size of the opportunity all right so i'm going to give you a hypothetical example that i just had i was talking to a business they were doing 100 new sales per month all right so that's number one i said cool what are you guys doing in revenue right now they were doing uh 400k in revenue i said okay this is really
(02:04) important you will want to pay attention to this video they had 380 clients all right their current price was a thousand dollars per month churn they didn't know lifetime value they didn't know all right so i said okay well the first thing we have to do is figure out where your hypothetical max is going to be all right so if we know the current number of new sales because they were like well i i have to get you these numbers later i don't have them on me i was like if you know these numbers we can do them live together and they're like oh i was
(02:30) like yeah so let's walk through it okay a thousand dollars a month is the price right and i said okay well how many customers are canceling every week and they said 13 people per week were cancelling i was like okay so roughly 50 per month okay makes sense everyone good here they said they have 380 active clients what we do is we take 380 active clients we divide it by 50 oops sorry 50 uh 50 people cancelling divided by 380 active clients i already did the math for you it's 13 churn all right so now we take our price
(03:06) all right which is a thousand dollars per client per month we divided by that 13 percent churn and we get 7 700 bucks all right roughly so now i know that 7 700 is going to be the ltv per customer all right which means that this business is going to cap out a 770k per month all right which is about 9 million bucks a year now they were currently doing about 400k now the thing is there's a lot of business and they were growing really rapidly right it makes sense because they were because they had this kind of sales velocity so with this kind of
(03:43) sales velocity they're going to keep growing pretty quickly and then it's going to become an asymptote which looks like this all right so an asymptote is you have a hypothetical max and it and it approaches it but never gets there all right so the asymptote here will be 770k the thing is is that the growth rate would slow down because churn is going to start eating a bigger and bigger and bigger percentage of the new business that is coming in we know the current clients we knew the new sales we know the current revenue right we know
(04:07) the hypothetical max which for me helps me analyze the potential opportunity of this business right we know the churn now which is 13 we know the lifetime value of each customer now which is 7 700 and i asked them what kind of margins are we running um on this and they were running over 90 percent gross margins all right and the easy way to do that is how much does it cost to to fulfill a customer so for them for that thousand dollar month customer it costs them less than a hundred dollars uh to fulfill on all right so it was very very
(04:38) very low cost business which means all you do is you multiply this by 0.9 and then you get let's see here let's see if i can do my own math really quickly all right so now you get roughly let's say seven thousand dollars okay so the lifetime gross profit per customer is seven thousand dollars which means as long as we're spending less than seven thousand dollars to acquire a customer we are going to be a profitable business right for the most part when we had this little discussion all right let's go back to our little drawing we know that
(05:08) they're going to cap right at 7700k right whatever you what i'm saying here right so if we want to grow this business we either have to increase this one or we have to increase this one that's it you can only grow a business by getting more customers or making them worth more period that's all we have to do and within this particular business i saw the opportunity here because i saw a 13 percent turn right because check out how this goes if we can just cut the churn to let's say three percent ah let's do some cool math you want to see
(05:39) something really quick sure alex i want to see all right fine i'll show you so if we've changed this to just three percent churn all right the new ltv becomes 33 000 per customer now this misses all of a sudden without changing anything else becomes a 3.3 million per month business that will become the new hypothetical hypothetical cap and almost all of that would be margin ah much more interesting right what most people do is they say hey i want to take this thing and see how we can get it to uh you know a thousand
(06:11) right which would be you know awesome because then that would get us to 7.7 million per month but which of these do you think is easier to do 10xing the acquisition or simply dropping your turn from 13 to 3 and there's lots of ways to drop churn and i had a different video where i said how i cracked netflix recurring revenue model there's eight c's to d to increase your stick or decrease your churn whatever way you want to say it that we'd be going through to figure out how we can cut churn from 13 to 3 percent and fyi
(06:36) for a company to have enterprise value most private equity firms want to see 80 yearly retention meaning you keep you keep 80 of your clients per year so if you start at a thousand beginning of the year you have 800 at the end of the year all right now if anyone wants to venture a guess at what 13 your monthly churn looks like you're probably keeping less than 20 of your customers by the end of the year all right and so for them they don't think that's an enterprise that's very valuable because what they're looking at
(07:02) um just in case i'll give you guys a little nugget here all right there's three main variables that they're going to be looking at any kind of any kind of potential buyer which is what's the growth number one number two is how likely uh stickiness which is like how likely is the the business going to be here and then what's the profit right so you could pretty much multiply these things together which is if i have a super fast growth company all of the revenue is super sticky and we're very profitable then this is going to be a
(07:28) very very very valuable business if i have a a business that is mediumly growing right it is not sticky and i have low profit then this is going to be a low value business and so the objective for us at acquisition.com is how do we take one of these guys right one of these businesses and turn them into one of these businesses and so it's really looking at these fundamental metrics to figure out where the weak points in the business model exist all right so right now if you're a business owner and you don't know what your
(07:57) hypothetical max is with your current model and your current numbers you are fooling yourself you don't know where you're going to cap out which means you don't know where your weak points are all right and so right now everyone should be able to do this math within their own business without any kind of complex recording without any kind of you know excel sheets that you're getting sent from finance all you need to do is you got to know how many new customers you're getting which is this guy how many new sales you're getting how
(08:23) many current clients you have where your current revenue is right what your prices are you should know all that stuff and as long as you can know how many people are canceling every month then you can calculate the rest of this entire equation for yourself and figure out how you can de-bottleneck the growth of your business because i'm a big believer in the theory of constraints which is a business will grow up to its nearest constraint and so all i try and do is simply remove the constraints of the business to allow it
(08:50) to grow right i see businesses organic beings they want to grow and they are simply being constrained by something and our goal is to find what the biggest constraint is and remove it most people try and do lots of things i believe that the smartest people in the world try and find how to do the fewest things that get them the most returns and removing the biggest constraint is the biggest one of those anywho my friends this is alex ramose reporting in from acquisition.

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video I'm going to talk about how to scale your company by scaling through hiring all right so if you guys don't know how to do these two things that I'm going to be walking through uh I will show you how to scale in the realest way all right like this is From The Trenches so if you guys don't know who I am my name is Alex Rosio and acquisition.
(00:18) comom you do about $85 million a year in Revenue so first time I heard this term uh was from my guy named Alex Tarin and this is a his in his external framework and I want to show you my internal framework for scaling the company on the inside all right and so um he talks about how there's there's five he calls them core functions of the business right so you've got lead generation you've got lead nurture which is working the leads to get them to to show you've got sales you've got fulfillment and then you've got retention and Ascension right
(00:46) so retention getting people to buy more times attention getting to buy more expensive stuff right so he calls these the five core functions right of any business Etc I remember looking at this and being like oh this is so cool and these are the things that U you should really never outs in your business it's my opinion right you should know how to generate leads you should know how to work the leads you know how to sell you should know how to fulfill and you know how to uh retain and Ascend your customers right if you don't know how to
(01:10) do these things and you haven't divided up your uh the activities of the business into this thing it's a very useful framework that you can use for yourself all right and think about this as a pipeline right that's everything here is done in sequence but here's the cool thing there is a parallel internal five core functions of a business that you can use and that you should use and when I realize this this is what allowed us to scale our business because we actually were able to use the same methodology the same thinking process of
(01:38) how we scaled our acquisition of getting more customers and continuing to grow that side to how we scale our employees and how we get them all right so follow along so what normally externally we're doing is lead generation here we're doing is application generation so this is how we're getting and the ads that we're running where we're running them and just like you can run an ad to get a prospect you can run an ad to get an employee just like you can do cold outbound to get a client you can use cold outbound to recruit from other
(02:09) companies you can use cold outbound to attract Talent all right so the same six ways of getting customers also works when you're actually getting employees all right so think about this hopefully this is a good mindset ship for you so there's six ways of getting customers I'll say them real quick you can do paid ads you can do earned media so if you have a following of any kind you can have your owned media so people you already have access to to on your lists your your your CRM your cell phone the people who follow you uh that that have
(02:36) given you access to them right that you can directly message them without asking their permission the fourth is through manual outbound the fifth is through Affiliates and the sixth is through word of mouth right there's the six ways you get customers right that is all of these things are traffic for how you generate leads but you can also use those same six for how you generate applications pretty cool right because right now all of us are one amazing higher away from all the growth you could ever want want
(03:00) and I promise you that and I've lived this firsthand is that a lot of times you don't need a what you need a who right you're trying to find and figure out this skill when someone already has that skill and the experience and has already run an Olympic gold multiple times you just say hey can you just run it over here rather than trying to figure it all out on your own it's much faster and simpler all right so just like you have lead generation you have application generation what goes next application nurture all right so there's
(03:24) some really interesting stats along this but 10 out of 10 employees high quality prospects will find a job within 8 days so if it takes you 6 days to even make your first contact with the the leads that you're getting from applications which honestly happens so common people work the crap out of their leads but don't but completely ignore the applications that are coming in for new employees right you should have just as structured of a process of how you're nurturing those applications so that they have a high liate of of scheduling
(03:52) and showing up for wait for it instead of sales are you still selling hell yeah you're still selling but we just call it interviewing right and and so we're selling them on why they should work for us right rather than someone else and right now more than ever before is a huge War for talent all right all the companies that I know of and all the guys who have bigger companies right now are all talking about it is that the the the the drive to acquired Talent is higher now than it ever has been and it's because of the shift of remote so
(04:20) now everyone is competing against Netflix Apple Google like all these huge companies are now fishing in all of our ponds because they're employing remote right and so what used to be in Advantage if you you know worked from home or you had an internet business is no is now just table Stakes work from home fible hours Etc is now table staks right and so now we have to get more aggressive and more deliberate in how we recruit and hire and that's the only way that you scale your company it's the only way once you increase this side you
(04:50) have to increase this side because you have to accommodate the demand that you're meeting I said there's five core functions these are the external ones these are the internal now who can guess what number four is right you have fulfillment for your customers but now you have training for your employees you take the person who now says yes and you make sure that they now go through the process which as a customer would be fulfilling before an employee is fulfilling on the job you just sold them on right and so you're
(05:18) actually giving them the skills and how you function and how you do things within your company what are the communication cadences who they going to report to what's the job description where the kpis are going to be measured on you know what their compensation structure is how they can get raises all that stuff and so that's the fourth thing that has to be defined within your internal pipeline that are that are core functions of the business now number five who can guess what this is normally you have retention and Ascension sorry
(05:42) my camera is just being wacky as hell I try to keep it try to keep it fun for you guys mix it up try and go in and out of focus number five is how are you going to retain and Ascend your talent how are you going to retain them so how you going to continue to motivate them so that they want to continue to perform that's the retention aspect and then how do we select the star players and Ascend them to higher levels and put them on a fast track so that they can move up within the company get more responsibility and make more impact to
(06:12) the bottom line in the business how can you identify the leaders early on and then put them on a track that allows them to grow which is one of the biggest things that if you see the biggest companies in the world it's because they have such amazing talent acquisition systems and retention and ascension systems for identifying talent and allowing them to move up all right the reason the biggest companies in the world are the biggest companies in the world is because they employ the smartest people I mean think about this
(06:35) if you find out that somebody worked at Facebook or they worked at Google at in any kind of relatively high up capacity you're going to probably assume that that person's very smart right so think about that kind of brand for your own business how can I make it so that my business becomes a a star or a stamp of approval on someone's Revenue uh someone's resume how can I make it so that my business is like Harvard Man and I can tell you there's definitely aspects of our business if someone like the amount of people who try and recruit
(07:04) my sales team is ridiculous right but we pay really well so it's hard and they also really like it here because we're a you know established business and they have a clear career path they can make lots of money but the thing is is that if you can create this thing where people aspire to be associated with your brand and your company then they will retain you will be able to track better people they will want to work for you because they'll know that your your training your fulfillment right that you have is so good
(07:30) that it's worth even taking a pay cut to acquire the skills through the the business that you have because you're so good at teaching it right these skills that make them more valuable and so I wanted to give you this as two parallel Frameworks that you can use within your business one is the external framework of lead generation lead nurture sales fulfillment retention and Ascension of how you bring people into your business and then there's a parallel or a mirror internal core functions of how you get generate you generate applications you
(07:58) uh nurture those applications so that they schedule and they show up for interviews you sell them during the interview so you should have a process a script just like you have a sales script you have a sales script internally how you can indoctrinate people once they come in to believe what you believe share the values that you have and then hopefully just like in a normal sale disqualify people that aren't going to be a good fit and then once they are in fulfill on the promises that you made to them increase the value of that person
(08:22) show them how they can fit and provide value to the company and then finally how do we what are the kpis that we use to manage these people what are they driving towards what are they going to get compensated and then how do we Ascend them what are the titles that they that they get and what are the increases in pay that are clear based on Milestones when they know they will qualify for that next raise or for that next increase in job so they can see a clear path of when they're going to work and continue to work for your company
(08:46) because if they have no way they can't see a future for where when they're going to work for you they're a ticking Time Bomb for when they're going to leave you for someone else all right and so Talent is the way that you scale the business and if you don't have a reliable way and you don't know the metrics of your talent acquisition system well then is it any wonder why you don't have the talent that you want so I'll leave you with that in terms of how to scale the business like I said mosy Nation there's lots of people who
(09:08) are broke I don't want you to be one of them that's why I make these videos keeping awesome I'll see you guys in the next viit bye

Transcript:
(00:00) what's going on guys I'm going to show you a quick video of how right now I can bill out my house for $10,000 a day and how you can do the exact same thing so by the end of this video you'll know step by step how you can get taxfree income by understanding the relationship between your home and your business so check this out so right now I've got my team at my house so this is my physical house you can say hey what's up dudes what up what's up recording stuff and um you can use something called the Augusta
(00:27) rule um which I'll break down in a couple seconds um on the on the screen so you can understand how it works but the cool thing is is you can use your home and generate taxfree income for you and a tax deduction for your business so you're basically double dipping twice and it's with assets you already have so by the end of this video you're going to have that stuff and you're going to be able to use it in your own business so if you're a business owner listen up watch this video to the end you're going to love it and in the meantime click
(00:51) subscribe before I switch over to the other video all right welcome back my name is Alex rosi I'm the owner of prestige Labs gym launch Allen and five other portfolio companies we do about $85 million a year and so the reason I made this channel is to help people who uh are broke and don't want to be anymore or people who have lots of money and want more of it and so that is the entire point of this and so let's rock and roll so one of the important pieces of you know making and increasing your net worth is making sure that you keep
(01:16) as much as you possibly can while you're generating income and I'm not saying you should be one of those people who's obsessed about it because a lot of times you should put more of your attention on your business creating value Etc but there's obviously like ways that you can decrease your tax drag right your your tax inefficiency I like to call them a lot of times and this is just my overarching strategy that I would say with taxes is that unless you're moving to Puerto Rico it's not going to be a silver bullet there's lots of golden BBS
(01:40) lots of little ways that you can save here and there and so right now I want to give you one of the easiest Tax Strategies that you can use if you're a small business owner pretty much of any kind like I said earlier in the video It's called The Augusta rule okay and so I'm going to try and explain this in 60 seconds it'll probably be a little bit longer but it will be worth every second of it all right so if you have your house you can rent your house to your business for employee meetings you can rent your house to your business for
(02:06) member events so if you have clients or customers who are flying into town or you want to hold an event or a small Mastermind or a workshop or anything like that at your home you can lease it to your business on top of that if you do recording like I have I've built out I put some Capital expense into my home which a increase the value of my house so I get increase in value two I can use that value to lease to my business at a higher rate than I normally would because a professional studio to rent out per day it would be5 to $10,000 a
(02:33) day and it cost me all in to make this studio uh 30,000 for this room and 50,000 for the other room which you'll probably see in other videos and so all it cost me about 80,000 but here's the cool part the Augusta rule states that we can lease our home to our business for up to 14 days all right and so whatever my day rate is that would be fair market I can multiply that by 14 and I can write myself a check for that provided I've used my home for that period of time now the reason and the when I heard about this I think it was 2
(03:01) or 3 years ago I went to a mastermind and a guy was like Hey I'm going to save everybody the entire cost of this Mastermind in the next 5 seconds and I was like okay I'm taking notes and I took the notes and I was like that was awesome and so in an effort to disseminate information to the masses for perspective if you're even making $100,000 a year and you can lease your home to yourself at a fair market rate of let's say $500 a day or maybe $1,000 a day that's $14,000 that you can write yourself as a taxfree check and take a
(03:26) deduction off of your income from the business all right easy Strate and if you have a CPA which hopefully you do just tell them it's the Augusta Rule and what you plan to do with it and they should be able to walk you through it from there and so hope you found video value in this video hopefully I can make you 10,000 20,000 $100,000 taxfree just from watching um and I've got other videos other strategies about increasing how much you make growing your business increasing your net worth and ultimately getting the freedom you want so uh check
(03:50) out those videos click subscribe if you liked it and if you didn't like it you can tell me that I suck and that's cool I'll I'll be okay either way all right lots of love keeping awesome we'll see you next video bye

How MILLIONAIRES become BILLIONAIRES... - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) one of the biggest shifts that i had as an entrepreneur going from you know making a few hundred thousand dollars a year a million dollars a year to making you know just 10 or nine figures like we do now has been um a simple understanding that i'm trying to hit at a couple different ways and hopefully you'll be able to shift your perspective in terms of how you see product and delivery and so right now if you're not making the amount of money that you want to make it's because the product you have is not good enough and it's it's really
(00:24) hard to confront that fact but if you really do and sit here i can't tell you the amount of times i talk to entrepreneurs and they're like man if i just had more people if more people would just find out about my product then all my problems would be solved but the reality is that if you have any amount of customers then people already have found out about your product and for one reason or another they have chosen not to tell anyone else about it and you have to sit with that for a second you have to realize that like
(00:46) people have found out about your product and they're not referring people and you have to ask why why are these people not sending me business and so one of the one of the first times i heard a statement that i really liked about this was from dan kennedy and he said most small entrepreneurs try and get customers to make sales bigger entrepreneurs try to make sales to get customers and the difference is one person is all about trying to get to the money as fast as possible what do i need to say to get this person say yes what i need to say
(01:15) to get this person to buy right how do i get the money right the other way is how do i make some sort of exchange so that i can now create a long time relationship with this customer and continue to provide value over time one has a compounding view and perspective on time and value and the other is short-sighted and i can tell you the difference between the people who are millionaires that i have that i'm friends with and people who are billionaires that i am friends with this is probably one of the most fundamental
(01:40) differences and so i was talking to a friend of mine who's worth of rebellion and he was saying if it's not going to grow on its own over time it's not worth doing and i really sat with that for a second and it was like if if i if you put in a one-time effort like this is what this is how people who are the ultra wealthy think if you put one-time effort into something and it compounds over time then that is an enterprise or product that they want to continue to invest in on the flip side if you have to consistently show up and consistently
(02:10) promote and consistently get out there and sell and sell and do all this stuff then what ends up happening is that the product itself is not good enough right because people in and of themselves are not referring business and so let me let me give you three questions that really changed and hopefully will alter your perspective like they did mine around product and service and so the first is if i have an existing product or service and i were to make it 10 times more expensive so really think about the price so or you can say a hundred
(02:37) thousand dollars or a million dollars whatever it is right just a huge number and if that's how much i were charging for it what would i need to do what would the experience need to be what would the product need to deliver in order for it to be worth that much what happens is you start thinking in a very different type of mindset about how much value you have to create right and so that is the first question that i ask there's two more and the third one's my favorite and i'll get to in a second the second question i ask
(03:05) is if this product that i have cost one-tenth as much as it does right now but i had to make it better than it currently is what would i need to do what one-time assets would i need to create that would consistently provide value that i could do at scale that could i could do profitably right so first question if this were 10 times expensive or 100 000 or a million dollars is what i charge for my product what would it need to be what would the experience need to be and what value would i need to deliver in order for it
(03:34) to be worth that much the second question is if it were one-tenth the cost but i had to make it better than my current product or service what else would i create or do or make in order to facilitate that outcome and the third question which is probably my favorite which i think underpins the entire ideology that that i'm hitting on here is if i had a business and i were only allowed to sell one more customer and the rest of the growth of my business had to come from that customer without me asking as in that that
(04:05) customer's experience was so remarkable was so positive was so amazing that they they alone had to on their own volition tell other people about my service what would need to happen what would need to happen to create that experience and when thinking about all three of these product frames i like them because they kind of hit on different aspects of the product the first question which is a hundred thousand dollar million dollar question hits on value which is how do i create the most value in the product itself
(04:35) the second question hits on the profit of the product because if it's one tenth of cost and i have to make it better this means i don't have to do high margin one-time investment type things to make the entire product more valuable right so that hits on profit so first is the value of the product the second is the profit to me right as a business owner and then the third question hits on the experience which is what's the customer experience which is everything else that surrounds the product that we're selling or service that we're
(05:00) selling right what is the experience that has to occur in order for this customer to become a raving fan that it's so good that they remark about it they cannot help themselves but remark about it and what's interesting is that every super wealthy person that i know pretty much exclusively talks about product and usually the really small people that i know only talk about promotion and promotion should really only exist to get your product right and then once it is right then you can juice it and then let it go and take care of itself
(05:30) and the reason that it's so important at least in my opinion is that if you think about the six ways of getting customers right and if you don't know what those are it's paid media earned media so paid media's advertising right in promotions uh earned media is followings right if you have any kind of organic following the third is through your contact list so people on your phone and your email list et cetera you already own their contact information the fourth is through manual outbound so that's dms cold emails cold
(05:55) calls cold all of that stuff where you reach out to people the fifth is through affiliates so partners who can promote your stuff and the sixth which is the most powerful and the only one that compounds is word of mouth so think about that for a second every of the other five ways of acquiring customers is not compounding those are linearly scaled right it means if you double the amount of outbound people you have you double the amount of customers that you get if you double your ad spend you might be able to double the amount of
(06:26) customers you get sometimes it's less than that but you get the idea they skill relatively linearly right whereas word of mouth referrals which is the sixth way of getting customers is the only one that compounds it multiplies rather than is additive all right if you get two people to tell two people and those people tell two people then it continues to compound and that is what creates enterprise value that is what creates an enduring thing and that is what when you spend the extra time to make the product so good that people
(06:53) have to tell their friends about it then that's where you get the unending scale and also is where all the profit is right you don't have to worry about the turn as much because the product's so good you don't have to worry about the negative reviews because the product's so good you don't have to worry about customers badminton because instead they're telling their friends about how good you are and this has been one of the shifts that has been most helpful for me and honestly what i when i look back on my own
(07:15) trajectory how much i talk about promotion in the beginning of my career versus now i talk so much more about people and product the real nuts of this is that everything that the ultra wealthy do is compounding it grows with time where time becomes an asset instead of a liability and if everything you do you have to go out and get more business go out and get more business go out and get more business right it means that it requires effort every single day whereas if you put a lot of front-end effort which is the
(07:42) investment which is the patience right to make the thing that much better in the beginning then it will pay you in dividends over time and most people skip that step because they just want to make the first sale they're just trying to get a customer to make a sale rather than trying to make a sale to get a customer and so um anyways i hope you found this valuable um i cover this stuff uh in in my book which is basically free it's 99 cents it's the cheapest i could let amazon do it it's called 100 million offers if
(08:09) you want to grab it i'm donating the 35 cents that amazon gives you like it gives me um it's for you guys it's everything that i've learned about how to create offers that uh are so good people feel stupid saying no um i think it's the number one seller in advertising and direct marketing on amazon right now um love you all hope you got value from this if you did hit that subscribe button and i'll see you guys in the next video lots of love catch you soon bye

Transcript:
(00:00) would you like to know how to network with millionaires and billionaires well having now met a lot of uh billionaires in my life and tried to build my own network of cool and interesting people um i continue to get questions on this channel about how to do that and so i wrote down kind of five rules that i have kind of lived by and you know my wife jokes about this she's like alex is the networker of uh you know between us and a lot of the things that i've had happen in my life that have been good have happened as a result of a
(00:32) conversation or connection that i've had from someone i've met randomly right and so i think that there's something to be said for having a deliberate process for networking without seeming like a skis right which is just like how can i meet cool people and just improve their lives while also improving my life i know the saying like your net worth is your network is your net worth i'm not sure how much i believe that but i do think that a lot of the big things in my life happened as a result of other people all
(00:58) right so here are the five rules uh that i will share with you that and there's two of them that are really really good uh number like four and five that i i highly highly recommend and i don't hear anyone else say all right so the first one really simple is whenever someone introduces themselves you always want to make sure that you remember their name right and so what i do is whenever i shake someone's hand i say their name and i keep saying it at like the beginning of every sentence i say um and i do it that way because i want to say
(01:24) it like 10 times throughout the conversation and it'll stick with me and i'm usually pretty good at remembering names and people remember that it's the favorite word in the in in whatever language someone's in their own name is their favorite word to hear all right and so you want to say it to them as much as you can because then they will know that you cared and you gave them respect and made them feel more important all right so number one is you always remember the name and you say them a lot of times number two you've
(01:47) got to get the contact info and otherwise like you know you're not going to actually have the network so what i do when i get someone's uh contact info is i immediately text them and i text them some sort of funny anecdote about myself or the conversation we were just having right and so for me it might be like i'll say their name and my name in the text because sometimes you forget to save the contact all right uh so it's like alex from mosey uh mustache gym guy right or something like that right i would say something in that in that vein
(02:16) and then i would say uh nice to meet you and then you know sam gamgee whatever right and so by doing that they see i see both names are there they know relevant stats about me and if you want to be extra bonus put their stuff in there too um furniture dude whatever right and so that way you won you gained rapport with them early on two you got their contact info and the thing is is when they look back at that text thread later if you can get them to laugh a little bit they'll remember oh yeah that was that cool guy or that funny or you
(02:48) know that that dude was relatively upbeat and pleasant so uh i would like to contact him again in the future right now rule number three always provide value first unsolicited all right so this is a key point if you had a conversation the con the goal of the conversation should be to figure out how you can provide value to the person not what that person can do for you all right it's a big one the goal and if you really want to truly build a great network you have to give first and you have to give it unsolicited all right so
(03:15) it's like hey i know you were talking about this i pulled up a bunch of these suppliers that i've worked with in the past i thought this might be valuable for you and honestly the more work you do in this unsolicited give the more people respect you and want to do business with you and keep you in their lives because you provided value first all right it's a key point you provided value first sorry about the smudgy weird ass camera rule number four and this is the biggest one this is like my biggest secret to uh networking so write this
(03:42) down always say yes to the first ask all right always say yes to the first ask the reason it's so important is that people like people aren't going to try a lot of times to be your friend if you met up at a a at a networking event or you met at a mastermind or you met it at something right and the neck the first ask be like hey let's touch base next week on a zoom or hey let's meet up in person or hey i'm in i'm in town where you're at you want to grab lunch i always do everything in my power to say yes to the first ass which means that
(04:13) sometimes i'll move stuff that's already there to accommodate the first meetup all right because i have learned this and i learned this really early in my life that people only ask once and most times if you don't get that first ask they'll never ask you again right and so we want to take advantage of now if you're on the asking side the key is to ask many many many times right but if you're on the receiving end say yes to the first ask so the two sides of that one are say yes to the first ask and if you're the one
(04:41) who's asking ask multiple times because sometimes life comes up and sometimes the people uh that will end up being huge players in your life later sometimes they just get busy and it has nothing to do with you rule four always say yes to the first ask and rule number five never ask for anything just don't do it because they'll immediately assume that you are trying to use them for something all right and so if anything if you if you need help on something and you're hoping that someone will help you then what you can
(05:08) do is when you're catching up you can describe a problem that you're currently dealing with if you have any level of rapport this person wants to have a continued relationship with you they will usually offer help to help you out all right and so what you can do is don't ask them for anything you can describe a problem that you're dealing with and talk about it and then usually they will they will make a reasonable ask and this is why giving first is important because people are reciprocal in nature if you give and you
(05:34) give well and you give unsolicited early and you never ask for anything people will find a way to give back to you unless the person really doesn't want to be your friend in which case you don't need to be friends with them because at the end of the day if you want to have a network that you actually enjoy then you want to network with cool people who you know are reciprocal in nature and want to give back too so those are the five rules for networking that have served me very well the last two especially are
(05:55) probably the most important which is never you know always always say yes to the first ask or ask multiple times if it's you um and never ask for anything uh inter from them because then they will always see you as a positive force of giving that is always just helping them out and they will be more inclined uh to to to build a relationship with you in the future and want to do business with you all right so there's the five rules for networking uh mosey nation uh keep being awesome if you guys don't know who i am uh my
(06:22) name is oxfosi on acquisition.com with about 85 million a year so keep being awesome i make these videos a lot of people broke and i want to be one of them all right see you next video bye

Transcript:
(00:00) if you are thinking of what to do next in your business and you're stuck and you've been plateauing at the same space i was asked to speak to a group of seven-figure entrepreneurs one of the questions that i was asked was how to get unstuck in this situation this is a multi-location owner who's trying to scale and license or franchise their business and the answer that they gave him is probably not what you would expect and may be the reason that you are stuck or not advancing at the speed with which you would like all right and so if you
(00:27) don't know who i am my name is aux mozy i own acquisition.com it's a portfolio of companies that is about 85 million a year and so if you are new to mozi nation welcome and enjoy the video i'll see you on the other side joy what are the different exit strategies you recommend i think i cover that with anu i think that i think for most people if you were trying to exit the gym i would be looking at customer or employee um and then right now and this is purposely because right now sba loans are just a joke to get in like
(00:51) zero interest so i think that those would be and you can put a percentage of seller financing in there to get a number that you feel comfortable with and it also doesn't put too much cash drag on the business that could be pretty attractive from both sides yeah so kind of to clarify on the question i guess that i was wondering like so we've looked at you know licensing or franchising or we want to just grow as a company and then just you know eventually sell it or what and so we haven't come up with a clear strategy we
(01:22) thought we wanted to do like a franchise route until i started to investigate and realize that it was going to be a huge headache but i guess kind of what are your thoughts on you know in the gym industry if you what are the different avenues you can take to exit the company and i mean either keep it or sell it how many locations do you have right now yeah uh three working on a fourth are they all different markets like different states are they concentrating on market in central california so we're not we haven't even entered into like a
(01:54) metropolitan area yet um i don't know if you guys are familiar with fresno california that's probably going to be our first uh city quote-unquote that we go into uh we're technically considered like towns the facilities do you want to stay in the fitness industry yeah i mean i've been doing it for 14 years now and i can't really real question that was not it's not loaded that's like kind of top level question so if you want to stay in the fitness industry how do i best package the skills that i have right now for making
(02:26) money i have a very important question yeah how much money do the locations make uh this year each location we profited what a little over a hundred thousand per no that was total between the three uh this but this year we spent quite a bit of money we had a bunch of stuff we were going through without getting too into it to uh so we had probably roughly 50 000 of expenses that we had that we won't next year yeah the first thing i'm thinking is if you've proven out the multiple locations and they're like as profitable as they can be before you
(03:03) scale further that's what i would be thinking just from where i set just knowing the amount of people that i know who grow who have multiple locations grow to like you know say double digit multiple and then they go licensing or franchise the most important piece and this is where everyone fails is they're just not profitable enough dude they're not the union economics suck you know what i mean um like i'm gonna i'm gonna do the i'm gonna do the dave dunham throw punch even if you do the add back for the 50k
(03:30) that's the one time expense if you're doing 50 000 net per facility no one's interested in that it might be like the the nasty medicine but it'll actually solve the pain or solve the problem so if you've got three locations the fact that you said we're thinking about a fourth i'm like why on god's green earth are you thinking about a fourth location when we're profiting 30 000 per year per location like that we're like this shouldn't even be discussion and the fact that we went from one to three with what i would consider poor profit
(03:55) metrics i wouldn't have advised that either but we're in that boat and that's fine right here we are i would bet you dollars to doughnuts that if you got rid of two of them and then focus your attention on one you would make more money than you have from the three just straight up and i think you need to fix the model like for the mob because like do you know how many like and i'm gonna be mean with this and it's not directed to you but it's more direct to the industry do you like do you know how many mom and pop [ __ ] licensing and
(04:19) franchises there are of three to five location owners a [ __ ] zillion of them and you know how many franchises never get above 30 locations because once they open they do the unit economics that we're talking about right now most of them and that's why most of them don't grow or go anywhere the guy who started it feels good because he tells his family and friends that he's a franchise and then everyone's like oh wow but they're broke and they don't know anything and so why would you care about impressing them and so
(04:49) if the goal is to make the most money it feels like you're in a rush that's what it feels like to me hearing what you just said and so i would lean towards and like i said this is going to be like the sour medicine if you really want to do this you got to do it right and you got to fix the model and the like the locations that you have have to be corporate they got to be the best [ __ ] gyms out there for someone to even consider buying into this either from a licensing perspective or from a franchising perspective like these guys
(05:20) should be running on 30 plus margins with and if you're if we're doing you know is it a large group small group right now we're just doing larger so we haven't even introduced the small group in yet uh we're working on you know our 90-day and all that stuff on the front end make sure that you're in a smaller market which believe it or not means you should be running on higher margins not lower margins because in the small markets your costs are low and there's also less competition the disadvantage of small markets is that leads
(05:51) are great in the beginning and then they suck that's the that's kind of the trade-off and so um and if anything your word of mouth and your retention has to be more important in a small in a small town than anything if you like for example if you said we've got the small town model down it's like i wouldn't go to fresno i'd be looking at what other small towns are there because we have that model down you go to fresno you're competing against everyone you know i mean and the guys you're competing against they're
(06:15) pulling out 250 400 a year because their locations are rocking so i think that the i think it's a it's it's a big look inwards of like have i wanted to open more locations so that i could save more locations and is my goal status or is my goal money it's important you don't have to answer now but like it's an important question if the goal is money then i would look a hard look at the other two locations and think about is there one of these that i can combine into one i can take the eft throw it into the other one maybe lose
(06:40) half of it but i get all of it on the same fixed overhead make more money at that second location and then look at that you know when my lease ends at the other one so i can focus my attention on making this gym as wildly profitable as humanly possible and then until this gym is growing without me with a team that's incentivized now i have an asset on the balance sheet if you have an asset on your personal net worth balance sheet that can then be leveraged in a number of different ways you could sell the thing you could license the thing you
(07:06) could do the franchise because now you have an actual unit itself that generates profit in a with a high return on capital which is what someone's going to look at from a franchise perspective a licensing perspective or from if you crush it you could own them all the guy who lives above me um in in vegas i think i've told you guys he owns panda express he owns them all he isn't franchise [ __ ] he did he did 3.
(07:31) 8 billion last year 26 margins guy 26 he took 935 million home in income that was his income when we asked what was the secret to success he said do the same thing for 45 years you get really [ __ ] good at making orange chicken i'm being real with you if it took you five years but then you had the best damn gym model out there and then five years after that you had 30 locations would that be enough because like life's long man and it feels like rush that's what i feel right now feels like there's a rush in a way i think it's just that we have
(08:07) a lot of people who were members in the past and moved to fresno and like we we think it'd be an easy entry to the market and so we do kind of feel like notice this thing is easy we've got three other gyms only making 30 grand a year you're going to put your attention there and those just go flat and then all of a sudden you're now at four locations you make no profit and then you're like [ __ ] when you were had when you had one facility just one way back how much were you making in profit a month like 40 grand
(08:37) so you make less money now and you got more locations yeah but we had kind of the at the time we were able to there was three owners and all three of us worked there and we had the small group and we had the personal training and in a way we had created the system that you guys have now but unintentionally and we just didn't even really realize it and now that we see it we're like oh [ __ ] that's why we made so much more money so uh we're getting back to you know our roots and trying to figure out how to implement it on a larger scale now and
(09:07) so that way you know once we do make it really profitable again then we have everything ready to roll for the next one so i would say one just final piece on this is just make it super profitable because of pride you have in doing a good job not so that you can do x y and z because then it makes x y and z the goal rather than the work if you make your intention to build the best [ __ ] gym out there not so that you can but just because it is what you take pride in you'll have what you want but it takes a big shift like i could just you know and
(09:40) if you'd asked me the franchise question originally like i could just say like yeah man like it's fine you got three out of fourth location and then you know talk to this guy and he'll set you up with franchising but like you wouldn't be successful not with the perspective that you have right now not with the uni economics if and i know this is probably not you know as fun on a group call but i'm just being real with you like if you really want to do this and you really want to do this fix the gym hardcore my feelings don't get hurt man
(10:04) i appreciate it i said it would love it it's absolutely desired for you to [ __ ] crush it action steps take a hard look at the other two locations i would consider consolidating one if you can look at when the other leases are up and then go back to making forty thousand dollars a month and then slowly slowly it might take a year it might take two years for you to get to that to keep forty thousand dollars a month without you being there at all once you do that then you can have the discussion of whatever else you want to do and if that
(10:36) sounds like man that's going to take time first point i said you're in a rush appreciate it mutual man thanks for thanks for speaking out

"My Employees Don't Take My Business Serious...Why?" - YouTube

Transcript:
(00:00) in this video I'm going to give you three ways to guarantee that people do not do what you want them to do especially employees in a business every one of us every day has tried to influence people internally in the business to do things that we want them to do we try to influence them with money we try to influence them with praise and accolades with a big Vision so that they get internally motivated to do the stuff but some people don't do it and so in this video what I want to do is break down the three best ways to
(00:20) guarantee that no one does what you want them to do you can take this process and you can reverse it if you want them to do what you want them to do but if we think about the things that we can do to get them to not want to do what we want them to do then it's much funnier from the top the easiest way to make sure that they do not do what you want them to do is don't tell them don't communicate the expectation don't even let them know that you want them to do it if you even do let them know that you want to do it make sure you don't record
(00:43) it because if you just say it in passing or say it on a conversation or a zoom call and it's not written anywhere you can still virtually guarantee that they're not going to do it especially if you don't repeat it don't ask about it frequently one line item on a quarterly report that happens versus you checking in twice a day about a statistic like if you do that they're definitely going to think it's important so don't do that just try to ask for it as infrequently as possible even so not even give them the metric to track so that's number one
(01:06) number two is make sure they don't know how to do it so if you want them to do something give them the task it's clearly communicated you repeated it you did it in a recorded fashion you do it frequently in terms of how frequently ask them but then just make sure they don't know how to do it it's the best way to set them up to fail don't train them around what you want them to do in general don't train them on how to prioritize their time so that they can get it done given their workload and then also make sure that you don't tell
(01:28) them how you specifically like it done because everybody has preferences right just make sure you don't train them on any of those things first two items in the Triangle Alex is how to make sure people don't do what you want them to do triangle the third piece of this triangle all right this is a this is a killer motivation we want to make sure that they are as unmotivated as humanely possible and maybe even ideally motivated or incentivized to not do it a couple ways you can do that is one don't pay them or directly compensate them for
(01:54) doing it number two you want the work to feel as pointless as possible you want them to feel like they're digging a hole only to push the dirt back in at the end of the day and then have no one there to even see that they did it you want to definitely not praise them for digging a good hole and then not actually show them that that hole is how you lay pipe how you lay electrical lines to to turn a building on jez I'm just I'm just killing it right now you don't want to show how it benefits other people that
(02:21) they care about within the company so for example if I said hey John I need you to put the call notes in from your sales call because Susie in finance it makes her life five times harder have to go through all this stuff and she can't be with her kid because she's working overtime taking all these calls trying to glean all this data going through customer support logs to fill in the blanks that you could do in 5 minutes and I know that you're the type of person so we went from purpose other people they care about to now we're
(02:43) going to talk about their own self-interest which is like I know you're the type of person who is honest right of course well you wouldn't promise something that's not real right okay well what you're doing right now you might not know it is that you're not giving us the notes to actually fulfill on the promises you're making so appeal to values and then you can also appeal to self-interest in the most tangible way you make more money by doing this when you do this thing it actually helps us sort through the applications so you
(03:02) can close a higher percentage of people at higher prices so you make more money per hour if you take these 5 minutes does that make sense cool and on top of that there's a little nugget on your bonuses according to making sure that you fill out call notes for over 95% of sales calls if we did that we'd have a high likelihood that they would do it so you want to reverse that whole equation when you're thinking about having a lens through which to have the conversation with somebody who's not doing the things
(03:22) that you want them to do this is how I would approach it this is the scripting I got this from Ila all cudos go to her she has a great YouTube channel you should check it out is say hey Johnny it's not like you to not attend to the details is it that you didn't know you don't know how or is it that you don't want to one we protected the person's ego cuz we said it's not like you so I'm not attacking you I'm attacking the activity it's this tiny little shift that makes these conversations so much easier then you give them a context
(03:43) through which that they can reply is it that you didn't know I didn't tell you I didn't record it I didn't talk about it frequently and I didn't give you the metrics is that what it is or is it that training wise I didn't train you on how to do it how I want you to do it and how to do it within the context of your larger workload or is it the things that I just covered with motivation motivation and training I stole from Andy Grove ruthlessly the founder of Intel and he wrote a book called high output management recommend a little bit
(04:04) Advanced and in that book he says the job of the boss is two things to motivate and to train in his mind he that either someone doesn't want to do it or they don't know how to do it I add in the third piece which is that they didn't know that you wanted to do it to begin with which I think happens a lot and so that has given birth to the acquisition triangle of how to get people to not do the things that you want them to do on the flip side I'm going to reverse those things and make sure that you set expectations you
(04:23) record it you talk about it frequently you give them the metrics to talk about it about train them on how to do it you train them how you prefer they do it and then you train them on how to do it with within the context of the larger workload they have and then you motivate them from a global level of how this feeds the business the other people they care about employees on how it impacts their life in a real way how it's going to help the customer and their experience from a values perspective you are this way and by doing this you are
(04:44) aligning with these values that are true to you and then finally you align to their pocketbook hey and if you do these things you can get a $500 bonus right or $1,000 bonus whatever it is keeping awesome mosy Nation I love you all don't deserve you keep being great see you in the next one bye
